THE WHITE HOUSE

WASHINGTON

October 12, 2022

From the earliest days of my Presidency, I have argued that our world is at an inflection point.
How we respond to the tremendous challenges and the unprecedented opportunities we face
today will determine the direction of our world and impact the security and prosperity of the
American people for generations to come. The 2022 National Security Strategy outlines how my
Administration will seize this decisive decade to advance America’s vital interests, position the
United States to outmaneuver our geopolitical competitors, tackle shared challenges, and set our
world firmly on a path toward a brighter and more hopeful tomorrow.

Around the world, the need for American leadership is as great as it has ever been. We are in the
midst of a strategic competition to shape the future of the international order. Meanwhile, shared
challenges that impact people everywhere demand increased global cooperation and nations
stepping up to their responsibilities at a moment when this has become more difficult. In
response, the United States will lead with our values, and we will work in lockstep with our
allies and partners and with all those who share our interests. We will not leave our future
vulnerable to the whims of those who do not share our vision for a world that is free, open,
prosperous, and secure. As the world continues to navigate the lingering impacts of the
pandemic and global economic uncertainty, there is no nation better positioned to lead with
strength and purpose than the United States of America.

From the moment I took the oath of office, my Administration has focused on investing in
America’s core strategic advantages. Our economy has added 10 million jobs and
unemployment rates have reached near record lows. Manufacturing jobs have come racing back
to the United States. We’re rebuilding our economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
We’ve made a generational investment to upgrade our Nation’s infrastructure and historic
investments in innovation to sharpen our competitive edge for the future. Around the world,
nations are seeing once again why it’s never a good bet to bet against the United States of
America.

We have also reinvigorated America’s unmatched network of alliances and partnerships to
uphold and strengthen the principles and institutions that have enabled so much stability,
prosperity, and growth for the last 75 years. We have deepened our core alliances in Europe and
the Indo-Pacific. NATO is stronger and more united than it has ever been, as we look to
welcome two capable new allies in Finland and Sweden. We are doing more to connect our
partners and strategies across regions through initiatives like our security partnership with
Australia and the United Kingdom (AUKUS). And we are forging creative new ways to work in
common cause with partners around issues of shared interest, as we are with the European
Union, the Indo-Pacific Quad, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, and the Americas
Partnership for Economic Prosperity.

These partnerships amplify our capacity to respond to shared challenges and take on the issues
that directly impact billions of people’s lives. If parents cannot feed their children, nothing else
matters. When countries are repeatedly ravaged by climate disasters, entire futures are wiped
out. And as we have all experienced, when pandemic diseases proliferate and spread, they can
worsen inequities and bring the entire world to a standstill. The United States will continue to
prioritize leading the international response to these transnational challenges, together with our
partners, even as we face down concerted efforts to remake the ways in which nations relate to
one another.

In the contest for the future of our world, my Administration is clear-eyed about the scope and
seriousness of this challenge. The People’s Republic of China harbors the intention and,
increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order in favor of one that tilts the global
playing field to its benefit, even as the United States remains committed to managing the
competition between our countries responsibly. Russia’s brutal and unprovoked war on its
neighbor Ukraine has shattered peace in Europe and impacted stability everywhere, and its
reckless nuclear threats endanger the global non-proliferation regime. Autocrats are working
overtime to undermine democracy and export a model of governance marked by repression at
home and coercion abroad.

These competitors mistakenly believe democracy is weaker than autocracy because they fail to
understand that a nation’s power springs from its people. The United States is strong abroad
because we are strong at home. Our economy is dynamic. Our people are resilient and creative.
Our military remains unmatched—and we will keep it that way. And it is our democracy that
enables us to continually reimagine ourselves and renew our strength.

So, the United States will continue to defend democracy around the world, even as we continue
to do the work at home to better live up to the idea of America enshrined in our founding
documents. We will continue to invest in boosting American competitiveness globally, drawing
dreamers and strivers from around the world. We will partner with any nation that shares our
basic belief that the rules-based order must remain the foundation for global peace and
prosperity. And we will continue to demonstrate how America’s enduring leadership to address
the challenges of today and tomorrow, with vision and clarity, is the best way to deliver for the
American people.

This is a 360-degree strategy grounded in the world as it is today, laying out the future we seek,
and providing a roadmap for how we will achieve it. None of this will be easy or without
setbacks. But Iam more confident than ever that the United States has everything we need to
win the competition for the 21st century. We emerge stronger from every crisis. There is
nothing beyond our capacity. We can do this—for our future and for the world.

PART I: THE COMPETITION FOR WHAT
COMES NEXT

“The world is changing. We’re at a significant inflection point in world history. And our country
and the world—the United States of America has always been able to chart the future in times of
great change. We’ve been able to constantly renew ourselves. And time and again, we’ve proven
there’s not a single thing we cannot do as a nation when we do it together—and I mean that—not

a single solitary thing.”

PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR

United States Coast Guard Academy's 140th Commencement Exercises

Our Enduring Vision

We are now in the early years of a decisive decade for America and the world. The terms of
geopolitical competition between the major powers will be set. The window of opportunity to
deal with shared threats, like climate change, will narrow drastically. The actions we take now
will shape whether this period is known as an age of conflict and discord or the beginning of a
more stable and prosperous future.

We face two strategic challenges. The first is that the post-Cold War era is definitively over and
a competition is underway between the major powers to shape what comes next. No nation is
better positioned to succeed in this competition than the United States, as long as we work in
common cause with those who share our vision of a world that is free, open, secure, and
prosperous. This means that the foundational principles of self-determination, territorial
integrity, and political independence must be respected, international institutions must be
strengthened, countries must be free to determine their own foreign policy choices, information
must be allowed to flow freely, universal human rights must be upheld, and the global economy
must operate on a level playing field and provide opportunity for all.

The second is that while this competition is underway, people all over the world are struggling to
cope with the effects of shared challenges that cross borders—whether it is climate change, food
insecurity, communicable diseases, terrorism, energy shortages, or inflation. These shared
challenges are not marginal issues that are secondary to geopolitics. They are at the very core of
national and international security and must be treated as such. By their very nature, these
challenges require governments to cooperate if they are to solve them. But we must be clear-eyed
that we will have to tackle these challenges within a competitive international environment
where heightening geopolitical competition, nationalism and populism render this cooperation
even more difficult and will require us to think and act in new ways.

6 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

KaKKKKK

This National Security Strategy lays out our plan to achieve a better future of a free, open,
secure, and prosperous world. Our strategy is rooted in our national interests: to protect the
security of the American people; to expand economic prosperity and opportunity; and to realize
and defend the democratic values at the heart of the American way of life. We can do none of
this alone and we do not have to. Most nations around the world define their interests in ways
that are compatible with ours. We will build the strongest and broadest possible coalition of
nations that seek to cooperate with each other, while competing with those powers that offer a
darker vision and thwarting their efforts to threaten our interests.

Our Enduring Role

The need for a strong and purposeful American role in the world has never been greater. The
world is becoming more divided and unstable. Global increases in inflation since the COVID-19
pandemic began have made life more difficult for many. The basic laws and principles governing
relations among nations, including the United Nations Charter and the protection it affords all
states from being invaded by their neighbors or having their borders redrawn by force, are under
attack. The risk of conflict between major powers is increasing. Democracies and autocracies are
engaged in a contest to show which system of governance can best deliver for their people and
the world. Competition to develop and deploy foundational technologies that will transform our
security and economy is intensifying. Global cooperation on shared interests has frayed, even as
the need for that cooperation takes on existential importance. The scale of these changes grows
with each passing year, as do the risks of inaction.

Although the international environment has become more contested, the United States remains
the world’s leading power. Our economy, our population, our innovation, and our military power
continue to grow, often outpacing those of other large countries. Our inherent national
strengths—the ingenuity, creativity, resilience, and determination of the American people; our
values, diversity, and democratic institutions; our technological leadership and economic
dynamism; and our diplomatic corps, development professionals, intelligence community, and
our military—remain unparalleled. We are experienced in using and applying our power in
combination with our allies and partners who add significantly to our own strengths. We have
learned lessons from our failures as well as our successes. The idea that we should compete with
major autocratic powers to shape the international order enjoys broad support that is bipartisan at
home and deepening abroad.

The United States is a large and diverse democracy, encompassing people from every corner of
the world, every walk of life, every system of belief. This means that our politics are not always
smooth—in fact, they’re often the opposite. We live at a moment of passionate political
intensities and ferment that sometimes tears at the fabric of the nation. But we don’t shy away
from that fact or use it as an excuse to retreat from the wider world. We will continue to reckon
openly and humbly with our divisions and we will work through our politics transparently and
democratically. We know that for all of the effort that it takes, our democracy is worth it. It is the
only way to ensure that people are truly able to live lives of dignity and freedom. This American
project will never be complete—democracy is always a work in progress—but that will not stop
us from defending our values and continuing to pursue our national security interests in the
world. The quality of our democracy at home affects the strength and credibility of our
leadership abroad—just as the character of the world we inhabit affects our ability to enjoy
security, prosperity, and freedom at home.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 7

KaKKKKK

Our rivals’ challenges are profound and mounting. Their problems, at both home and abroad, are
associated with the pathologies inherent in highly personalized autocracies and are less easily
remedied than ours. Conversely, the United States has a tradition of transforming both domestic
and foreign challenges into opportunities to spur reform and rejuvenation at home. This is one
reason that prophecies of American decline have repeatedly been disproven in the past—and
why it has never been a good bet to bet against America. We have always succeeded when we
embrace an affirmative vision for the world that addresses shared challenges and combine it with
the dynamism of our democracy and the determination to out-compete our rivals.

The Nature of the Competition Between Democracies and Autocracies

The range of nations that supports our vision of a free, open, prosperous, and secure world is
broad and powerful. It includes our democratic allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific as well as
key democratic partners around the world that share much of our vision for regional and
international order even if they do not agree with us on all issues, and countries that do not
embrace democratic institutions but nevertheless depend upon and support a rules-based
international system.

Americans will support universal human rights and stand in solidarity with those beyond our
shores who seek freedom and dignity, just as we continue the critical work of ensuring equity
and equal treatment under law at home. We will work to strengthen democracy around the world
because democratic governance consistently outperforms authoritarianism in protecting human
dignity, leads to more prosperous and resilient societies, creates stronger and more reliable
economic and security partners for the United States, and encourages a peaceful world order. In
particular, we will take steps to show that democracies deliver—not only by ensuring the

United States and its democratic partners lead on the hardest challenges of our time, but by
working with other democratic governments and the private sector to help emerging democracies
show tangible benefits to their own populations. We do not, however, believe that governments
and societies everywhere must be remade in America’s image for us to be secure.

The most pressing strategic challenge facing our vision is from powers that layer authoritarian
governance with a revisionist foreign policy. It is their behavior that poses a challenge to
international peace and stability—especially waging or preparing for wars of aggression, actively
undermining the democratic political processes of other countries, leveraging technology and
supply chains for coercion and repression, and exporting an illiberal model of international order.
Many non-democracies join the world’s democracies in forswearing these behaviors.
Unfortunately, Russia and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) do not.

Russia and the PRC pose different challenges. Russia poses an immediate threat to the free and
open international system, recklessly flouting the basic laws of the international order today, as
its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine has shown. The PRC, by contrast, is the only
competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic,
diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.

Just as the United States and countries around the world benefited greatly from the post-Cold
War international order, so too did the PRC and Russia. The PRC’s economy and geopolitical
influence grew rapidly. Russia joined the G8 and G20 and recovered economically in the 2000s.
And yet, they concluded that the success of a free and open rules-based international order posed
a threat to their regimes and stifled their ambitions. In their own ways, they now seek to remake

8 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

KaKKKKK

the international order to create a world conducive to their highly personalized and repressive
type of autocracy.

Their pursuit of this vision is complicated by several factors. The PRC’s assertive behavior has
caused other countries to push back and defend their sovereignty, for their own, legitimate
reasons. The PRC also retains common interests with other countries, including the

United States, because of various interdependencies on climate, economics, and public health.
Russia’s strategic limitations have been exposed following its war of aggression against Ukraine.
Moscow also has some interest in cooperation with countries that do not share its vision,
especially in the global south. As a result, the United States and our allies and partners have an
opportunity to shape the PRC and Russia’s external environment in a way that influences their
behavior even as we compete with them.

Some parts of the world are uneasy with the competition between the United States and the
world’s largest autocracies. We understand these concerns. We also want to avoid a world in
which competition escalates into a world of rigid blocs. We do not seek conflict or a new Cold
War. Rather, we are trying to support every country, regardless of size or strength, in exercising
the freedom to make choices that serve their interests. This is a critical difference between our
vision, which aims to preserve the autonomy and rights of less powerful states, and that of our
rivals, which does not.

Cooperating to Address Shared Challenges in an Era of Competition

Heightened competition between democracies and autocracies is just one of two critical trends
we face. The other is shared challenges—or what some call transnational challenges—that do not
respect borders and affect all nations. These two trends affect each other—geopolitical
competition changes, and often complicates, the context in which shared challenges can be
addressed while those problems often exacerbate geopolitical competition, as we saw with the
early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic when the PRC was unwilling to cooperate with the
international community. We cannot succeed in our competition with the major powers who
offer a different vision for the world if we do not have a plan to work with other nations to deal
with shared challenges and we will not be able to do that unless we understand how a more
competitive world affects cooperation and how the need for cooperation affects competition. We
need a strategy that not only deals with both but recognizes the relationship between them and
adjusts accordingly.

Of all of the shared problems we face, climate change is the greatest and potentially existential
for all nations. Without immediate global action during this crucial decade, global temperatures
will cross the critical warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius after which scientists have
warned some of the most catastrophic climate impacts will be irreversible. Climate effects and
humanitarian emergencies will only worsen in the years ahead—from more powerful wildfires
and hurricanes in the United States to flooding in Europe, rising sea levels in Oceania, water
scarcity in the Middle East, melting ice in the Arctic, and drought and deadly temperatures in
sub-Saharan Africa. Tensions will further intensify as countries compete for resources and
energy advantage—increasing humanitarian need, food insecurity and health threats, as well as
the potential for instability, conflict, and mass migration. The necessity to protect forests
globally, electrify the transportation sector, redirect financial flows and create an energy
revolution to head off the climate crisis is reinforced by the geopolitical imperative to reduce our
collective dependence on states like Russia that seek to weaponize energy for coercion.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 9

KaKKKKK

It is not just climate change. COVID-19 has shown that transnational challenges can hit with the
destructive force of major wars. COVID-19 has killed millions of people and damaged the
livelihoods of hundreds of millions, if not more. It exposed the insufficiency of our global health
architecture and supply chains, widened inequality, and wiped out many years of development
progress. It also weakened food systems, brought humanitarian need to record levels, and
reinforced the need to redouble our efforts to reduce poverty and hunger and expand access to
education in order to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
Meanwhile, communicable diseases like Ebola continue to reemerge and can only be dealt with
if we act early and with other nations. The pandemic has made clear the need for international
leadership and action to create stronger, more equitable, and more resilient health systems—so
that we can prevent or prepare for the next pandemic or health emergency before it starts.

The global economic challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have been extended
and deepened globally as uneven, recovering demand has outpaced suppliers and put strains on
supply chains. Consumers and policymakers the world over have also struggled with surging
energy prices and mounting food insecurity, which sharpen security challenges like migration
and corruption. Moreover, autocratic governments often abuse the global economic order by
weaponizing its interconnectivity and its strengths. They can arbitrarily raise costs by
withholding the movement of key goods. They leverage access to their markets and control of
global digital infrastructure for coercive purposes. They launder and hide their wealth, often the
proceeds of foreign corrupt practices, in major economies through shell and front companies.
Nefarious actors—some state sponsored, some not—are exploiting the digital economy to raise
and move funds to support illicit weapons programs, terrorist attacks, fuel conflict, and to extort
everyday citizens targeted by ransomware or cyber-attacks on national health systems, financial
institutions and critical infrastructure. These various factors constrain our policy options, and
those of our allies and partners, to advance our security interests and meet the basic needs of our
citizens.

We have also experienced a global energy crisis driven by Russia’s weaponization of the oil and
gas supplies it controls, exacerbated by OPEC’s management of its own supply. This
circumstance underscores the need for an accelerated, just, and responsible global energy
transition. That’s why — even as we continue to explore all opportunities with our allies and
partners to stabilize energy markets and get supplies to those who need it — we are also focused
on implementing the most significant piece of climate legislation in our nation’s history, to bring
innovative energy technologies to scale as quickly as possible.

We must work with other nations to address shared challenges to improve the lives of the
American people and those of people around the world. We recognize that we will undertake
such effort within a competitive environment where major powers will be actively working to
advance a different vision. We will use the impulses released by an era of competition to create a
race to the top and make progress on shared challenges, whether it is by making investments at
home or by deepening cooperation with other countries that share our vision.

Overview of Our Strategic Approach

Our goal is clear—we want a free, open, prosperous, and secure international order. We seek an
order that is free in that it allows people to enjoy their basic, universal rights and freedoms. It is
open in that it provides all nations that sign up to these principles an opportunity to participate in,

10 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

KaKKKKK

and have a role in shaping, the rules. It is prosperous in that it empowers all nations to
continually raise the standard of living for their citizens. And secure, in that it is free from
aggression, coercion and intimidation.

Achieving this goal requires three lines of effort. We will: 1) invest in the underlying sources and
tools of American power and influence; 2) build the strongest possible coalition of nations to
enhance our collective influence to shape the global strategic environment and to solve shared
challenges; and 3) modernize and strengthen our military so it is equipped for the era of strategic
competition with major powers, while maintaining the capability to disrupt the terrorist threat to
the homeland. This is covered in Part II of this strategy.

We will use these capabilities to outcompete our strategic competitors, galvanize collective
action on global challenges, and shape the rules of the road for technology, cybersecurity, and
trade and economics. This is covered in Part III. Our approach encompasses all elements of
national power—diplomacy, development cooperation, industrial strategy, economic statecraft,
intelligence, and defense—and is built on several key pillars.

First, we have broken down the dividing line between foreign policy and domestic policy. We
understand that if the United States is to succeed abroad, we must invest in our innovation and
industrial strength, and build our resilience, at home. Likewise, to advance shared prosperity
domestically and to uphold the rights of all Americans, we must proactively shape the
international order in line with our interests and values. In a competitive world, where other
powers engage in coercive or unfair practices to gain an edge over the United States and our
allies, this takes on a special importance. We must complement the innovative power of the
private sector with a modern industrial strategy that makes strategic public investments in
America’s workforce, and in strategic sectors and supply chains, especially critical and emerging
technologies, such as microelectronics, advanced computing, biotechnologies, clean energy
technologies, and advanced telecommunications.

Second, our alliances and partnerships around the world are our most important strategic asset
and an indispensable element contributing to international peace and stability. A strong and
unified NATO, our alliances in the Indo-Pacific, and our traditional security partnerships
elsewhere do not only deter aggression; they provide a platform for mutually beneficial
cooperation that strengthens the international order. We place a premium on growing the
connective tissue—on technology, trade and security—between our democratic allies and
partners in the Indo-Pacific and Europe because we recognize that they are mutually reinforcing
and the fates of the two regions are intertwined. The United States is a global power with global
interests. We are stronger in each region because of our affirmative engagement in the others. If
one region descends into chaos or is dominated by a hostile power, it will detrimentally impact
our interests in the others.

Third, this strategy recognizes that the PRC presents America’s most consequential geopolitical
challenge. Although the Indo-Pacific is where its outcomes will be most acutely shaped, there are
significant global dimensions to this challenge. Russia poses an immediate and ongoing threat to
the regional security order in Europe and it is a source of disruption and instability globally but it
lacks the across the spectrum capabilities of the PRC. We also recognize that other smaller
autocratic powers are also acting in aggressive and destabilizing ways. Most notably, Iran
interferes in the internal affairs of neighbors, proliferates missiles and drones through proxies, is
plotting to harm Americans, including former officials, and is advancing a nuclear program

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 11

KaKKKKK

beyond any credible civilian need. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)
continues to expand its illicit nuclear weapons and missile programs.

Fourth, we will avoid the temptation to see the world solely through the prism of strategic
competition and will continue to engage countries on their own terms. We will pursue an
affirmative agenda to advance peace and security and to promote prosperity in every region. A
more integrated Middle East that empowers our allies and partners will advance regional peace
and prosperity, while reducing the resource demands the region makes on the United States over
the long term. In Africa, the dynamism, innovation, and demographic growth of the region
render it central to addressing complex global problems. The Western Hemisphere directly
impacts the United States more than any other region so we will continue to revive and deepen
our partnerships there to advance economic resilience, democratic stability, and citizen security.

Fifth, we recognize that globalization has delivered immense benefits for the United States and
the world but an adjustment is now required to cope with dramatic global changes such as
widening inequality within and among countries, the PRC’s emergence as both our most
consequential competitor and one of our largest trading partners, and emerging technologies that
fall outside the bounds of existing rules and regulations. We have an affirmative agenda for the
global economy to seize the full range of economic benefits of the 21st century while advancing
the interests of American workers. Recognizing we have to move beyond traditional Free Trade
Agreements, we are charting new economic arrangements to deepen economic engagement with
our partners, like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF); a global
minimum tax that ensures corporations pay their fair share of tax wherever they are based in the
world; the Partnership for Global Investment and Infrastructure (PGI) to help low- and middle-
income countries secure high-standard investment for critical infrastructure; updated rules of the
road for technology, cyberspace, trade, and economics; and ensuring the transition to clean
energy unlocks economic opportunities and good jobs around the world.

Finally, the community of nations that shares our vision for the future of international order is
broad and includes countries on every continent. We share in common a desire for relations
among nations to be governed by the UN Charter; for the universal rights of all individuals—
political, civil, economic, social and cultural—to be upheld; for our environment, air, oceans,
space, cyberspace and arteries of international commerce to be protected and accessible for all;
and for international institutions, including the United Nations, to be modernized and
strengthened to better address global challenges and deliver more tangible benefits for our
citizens. The order we seek builds on what came before, but addresses serious shortcomings, new
realities, and the attempts by some states to advance a much less free and open model. To
preserve and increase international cooperation in an age of competition, we will pursue a dual-
track approach. On one track, we will cooperate with any country, including our geopolitical
rivals, that is willing to work constructively with us to address shared challenges. We will also
fully engage with, and work to strengthen, international institutions. On the other track, we will
deepen our cooperation with democracies and other like-minded states. From the Indo-Pacific
Quad (Australia, India, Japan, United States) to the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council,
from AUKUS (Australia, United Kingdom, United States) to I12-U2 (India, Israel, UAE,

United States), we are creating a latticework of strong, resilient, and mutually reinforcing
relationships that prove democracies can deliver for their people and the world.

The world is now at an inflection point. This decade will be decisive, in setting the terms of our
competition with the PRC, managing the acute threat posed by Russia, and in our efforts to deal

with shared challenges, particularly climate change, pandemics, and economic turbulence. If we
do not act with urgency and creativity, our window of opportunity to shape the future of
international order and tackle shared challenges will close. Those actions must begin with

developing the means to execute our strategy, by making renewed investments at home and
abroad.

PART II: INVESTING IN OUR STRENGTH

“As we look ahead, we will lead. We will lead on all the greatest challenges of our time—from
COVID to climate, peace and security, human dignity and human rights. But we will not go it
alone. We will lead together with our Allies and partners and in cooperation with all those who
believe, as we do, that this is within our power to meet these challenges, to build a future that

lifts all of our people and preserves this planet. But none of this is inevitable; it’s a choice. And I

,

can tell you where America stands: We will choose to build a better future.’

PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR

76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly

Investing in Our National Power to Maintain a
Competitive Edge

To outcompete our rivals and tackle shared challenges, America will need to maintain and refine
its competitive edge by making critical domestic investments. In an interconnected world, there
is no bright line between foreign and domestic policy. The future of America’s success in the
world depends upon our strength and resilience at home—and especially the strength of our
middle class, which is critical to our national security as an engine of economic growth and a key
source of democratic vibrance and cohesion. The reverse is also true. Our success at home
requires robust and strategic engagement in the world in line with our interests and values to
make life better, safer, and fairer for the American people. That is why we must make
far-reaching investments in the sources of our natural strength while building our resilience.

Implementing a Modern Industrial and Innovation Strategy

The private sector and open markets have been, and continue to be, a vital source of our national
strength and a key driver of innovation. However, markets alone cannot respond to the rapid
pace of technological change, global supply disruptions, nonmarket abuses by the PRC and other
actors, or the deepening climate crisis. Strategic public investment is the backbone of a strong
industrial and innovation base in the 21st century global economy.

That is why the United States is pursuing a modern industrial and innovation strategy. We are
identifying and investing in key areas where private industry, on its own, has not mobilized to
protect our core economic and national security interests, including bolstering our national
resilience. We are securing our critical infrastructure, advancing foundational cybersecurity for
critical sectors from pipelines to water, and working with the private sector to improve security
defenses in technology products. We are securing our supply chains, including through new
forms of public-private collaboration, and using public procurement in critical markets to
stimulate demand for innovation. In 2021, we boosted our competitiveness by enacting the
largest investment in physical infrastructure in nearly a century, including historic investments in

14 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

KaKKKKK

transportation, broadband, clean water, and energy infrastructure that will increase economic
growth for decades to come. We recognize the importance of the semiconductor supply chain to
our competitiveness and our national security, and we are seeking to reinvigorate the
semiconductor industry in the United States. The CHIPS and Science Act authorizes $280 billion
for civilian investment in research and development, especially in critical sectors such as
semiconductors and advanced computing, next-generation communications, clean energy
technologies, and biotechnologies. Through the National Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing
Initiative, we are investing more than $2 billion to harness the full potential of biotechnology and
biomanufacturing, create jobs at home, strengthen supply chains, and reduce carbon emissions.

In 2022, we enacted the Inflation Reduction Act which will invest in domestic energy production
and manufacturing, and reduce carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030. Combatting the
climate crisis, bolstering our energy security, and hastening the clean energy transition is integral
to our industrial strategy, economic growth, and security. We are incubating and deploying new
technologies and solutions, allowing us to lead the world while creating new markets and
scalable approaches. Together, these investments will keep the United States at the leading edge,
increase economic capacity, and support millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic
activity over the next decade. Across these efforts, we are mobilizing the talent, grit, and
innovation of American workers, who can out-compete anyone. We are also prioritizing equity
and investing in regional economic development to ensure the future is made across all of
America, by all Americans.

As we do this work, we are also protecting our investments and bolstering their resilience
through tracking, attributing, and defending against the activities of malicious actors in
cyberspace. And we are countering intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, and
other attempts to degrade our technological advantages by enhancing investment screening,
export controls, and counterintelligence resources. Just as we seek to pool technical expertise and
complementary industrial capacity with our allies and partners, we are also enhancing our
collective capacity to withstand attempts to degrade our shared technology advantages, including
through investment screening and export controls, and the development of new regimes where
gaps persist.

Investing In Our People

We are focused on strengthening the economy by building from the bottom up and the middle
out. To that end, we know the most impactful public investments are the ones we make in our
people. We seek to increase equitable access to affordable health care and child care; career-long
training and skill building; and high-quality education and training, including science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), especially for women and girls. These
investments will boost our economic capacity by ensuring our workforce is better educated,
healthier, and more productive. This stronger workforce will also build enduring advantages that
bolster our strength and resilience. We are also supporting workers by promoting union
organizing and collective bargaining, and improving workers’ job quality.

As we create the conditions for our people to thrive, we will also continue to make America the
destination of choice for talent around the world. Since the founding of our Nation, America has
been strengthened and renewed by immigrants seeking opportunity and refuge on our shores—a
unique strategic advantage. We will continue working with Congress and taking executive action
to ensure our immigration and refugee systems are fair, orderly, humane, easier to navigate, and

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 15

KaKKKKK

consistent with our values and the law. And we will take further measures to ensure the
United States remains the world’s top destination for talent.

Strengthening Our Democracy

Our democracy is at the core of who we are, and America’s democratic experiment has long
been a source of inspiration for people around the world. Our system of government enshrines
the rule of law and strives to protect the equality and dignity of all individuals. Deliberation and
informed debate propel us to correct our mistakes, better meet public needs, and expand the
circle of opportunity. We have not always lived up to our ideals and in recent years our
democracy has been challenged from within. But we have never walked away from our ideals
and in each challenging moment, citizens have stepped forward to uphold them. In times of crisis
or lapses in judgment, we look to more democracy—not less—to forge the path forward. Our
democracy is a work in progress—and by reckoning with and remedying our own shortcomings,
we can inspire others around the world to do the same.

As Americans, we must all agree that the people’s verdict, as expressed in elections, must be
respected and protected. We also believe that critical reforms continue to be needed to strengthen
our system of governance. This is why we have taken executive action and urged essential
legislation to protect and promote voting rights and expand democratic participation, and why we
are building on the work of generations of activists to advance equity and root out systemic
disparities in our laws, policies, and institutions. Indeed, pluralism, inclusion, and diversity are a
source of national strength in a rapidly changing world. We are reaffirming the rights to free
speech, a free press, peaceful assembly, and other core civil liberties. And at the same time, we
are standing up to threats to our democracy such as domestic terrorism by implementing our
nation’s first-ever National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism and tackling head-on
global forces like weaponized corruption, information manipulation operations, political
interference, and attacks on the rule of law, including in elections. America will not tolerate
foreign interference in our elections. We will act decisively to defend, and deter disruptions to
our democratic processes, and we will respond to future interference using all appropriate tools
of national power.

Using Diplomacy to Build the Strongest Possible Coalitions

The United States’ unrivaled network of allies and partners protects and advances our interests
around the world—and is the envy of our adversaries. Building on this network, we will
assemble the strongest possible coalitions to advance and defend a world that is free, open,
prosperous, and secure. These coalitions will include all nations that share these objectives. At
the heart of this coalition, to ensure it is as transformative as possible, are democratic nations
who share our interests and values. To make our coalitions as inclusive as possible, we will also
work with any country that supports a rules-based order while we continue to press all partners to
respect and advance democracy and human rights.

Transformative Cooperation

To solve the toughest problems the world faces, we need to produce dramatically greater levels
of cooperation. The key to doing this is to recognize that the core of our inclusive coalition are
those partners who most closely share our interests. America’s treaty alliances with other

16 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

KaKKKKK

democratic countries are foundational to our strategy and central to almost everything we do to
make the world more peaceful and prosperous. Our NATO and bilateral treaty allies should
never doubt our will and capacity to stand with them against aggression and intimidation. As we
modernize our military and work to strengthen our democracy at home, we will call on our allies
to do the same, including by investing in the type of capabilities and undertaking the planning
necessary to bolster deterrence in an increasingly confrontational world.

America’s alliances and partnerships have played a critical role in our national security policy for
eight decades, and must be deepened and modernized to do so into the future. NATO has
responded with unity and strength to deter further Russian aggression in Europe, even as NATO
also adopted a broad new agenda at the 2022 Madrid Summit to address systemic challenges
from the PRC and other security risks from cyber to climate, as well as agreeing to Finland and
Sweden’s application to join the alliance. The newly established U.S.-EU Trade and Technology
Council is coordinating approaches to setting the rules of the road on global technology,
economic, and trade issues based on shared democratic values. Our AUKUS security partnership
with Australia and the United Kingdom promotes stability in the Indo-Pacific while deepening
defense and technology integration. We continue to deepen cooperation with the Five Eyes (with
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom). The revitalized Quad, which brings
the United States together with Japan, India, and Australia, addresses regional challenges and has
demonstrated its ability to deliver for the Indo-Pacific, combating COVID-19 and climate
change, to deepening cybersecurity partnerships and promoting high standards for infrastructure
and health security. Our intelligence relationships with our allies are a strategic asset that will
increasingly factor in to our competition with our rivals, especially in technological competition.

We will continue to prioritize seeking out new ways to integrate our alliances in the Indo-Pacific
and Europe and develop new and deeper means of cooperation. We have revitalized the G7 as
the steering committee of the world’s advanced industrial democracies and believe it has a
critical role to play in supporting our shared vision for the international order. The G7 is at its
strongest when it also formally engages other countries with aligned goals, such as at the 2022
summit where Argentina, India, Indonesia, Senegal, South Africa, and Ukraine also participated.
USS. interests are best served when our European allies and partners play an active role in the
Indo-Pacific, including in supporting freedom of navigation and maintaining peace and stability
across the Taiwan Strait. Similarly, we want our Indo-Pacific allies to be engaged cooperatively
with our European allies on shaping the order to which we all aspire, and by standing up to
Russia and cooperating with the European Union and United Kingdom on our competition with
the PRC. This is not a favor to the United States. Our allies recognize that a collapse of the
international order in one region will ultimately endanger it in others.

These democratic allies and partners are also essential to supporting democracy and human
rights around the world. Actions to bolster democracy and defend human rights are critical to the
United States not only because doing so is consistent with our values, but also because respect
for democracy and support for human rights promotes global peace, security, and prosperity.
Global threats to accountable and transparent governance also threaten our own democratic
system. We will continually update our range of tools to advance democracy and counter
authoritarianism. The Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal qualitatively increases our
ability to combat defining challenges of the 2020s, like grand corruption, digital repression, and
attacks on elections and independent media. By the same token, we are responding to the ever-
evolving ways in which authoritarians seek to subvert the global order, notably by weaponizing

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 17

KaKKKKK

information to undermine democracies and polarize societies. We are doing so by working with
governments, civil society, independent media, and the private sector to prevent credible
information from being crowded out, exposing disinformation campaigns, and strengthening the
integrity of the media environment - a bedrock of thriving democracies. Together with our allies
and partners, we are also holding states accountable for violations and abuses of human rights,
including against ethnic and religious minorities, treating the fight against corruption as the core
national security interest it is, countering transnational repression, and standing with people
around the world on the front lines of the fight for dignity, equality and justice. We reaffirm our
commitment to work with the international community to achieve sustainable, long-term
solutions to what is the most severe refugee crisis since World War Two—including through
resettlement. We raised our annual refugee admissions cap to 125,000 and are rebuilding and
improving the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program to enable us to achieve that goal.

An Inclusive World

The vast majority of countries want a stable and open rules-based order that respects their
sovereignty and territorial integrity, provides a fair means of economic exchange with others and
promotes shared prosperity, and enables cooperation on shared challenges. They strongly
disapprove of aggression, coercion, and external interference. They have no interest in
overturning longstanding rules and norms to make the world safe for aggression and repression.

We will help construct and preserve coalitions that engage all of these countries and leverage
their collective strengths. We recognize that some may harbor reservations about American
power and our foreign policy. Others may not be democratic but nevertheless depend upon a
tules-based international system. Yet what we share in common, and the prospect of a freer and
more open world, makes such a broad coalition necessary and worthwhile. We will listen to and
consider ideas that our partners suggest about how to do this.

Building this inclusive coalition requires reinforcing the multilateral system to uphold the
founding principles of the United Nations, including respect for international law. 141 countries
expressed support at the United Nations General Assembly for a resolution condemning Russia’s
unprovoked aggression against Ukraine. We continue to demonstrate this approach by engaging
all regions across all issues, not in terms of what we are against but what we are for. This year,
we partnered with ASEAN to advance clean energy infrastructure and maritime security in the
region. We kickstarted the Prosper Africa Build Together Campaign to fuel economic growth
across the continent and bolster trade and investment in the clean energy, health, and digital
technology sectors. We are working to develop a partnership with countries on the Atlantic
Ocean to establish and carry out a shared approach to advancing our joint development,
economic, environmental, scientific, and maritime governance goals. We galvanized regional
action to address the core challenges facing the Western Hemisphere by spearheading the
Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity to drive economic recovery and by mobilizing the
region behind a bold and unprecedented approach to migration through the Los Angeles
Declaration on Migration and Protection. In the Middle East, we have worked to enhance
deterrence toward Iran, de-escalate regional conflicts, deepen integration among a diverse set of
partners in the region, and bolster energy stability.

A prime example of an inclusive coalition is IPEF, which we launched alongside a dozen
regional partners that represent 40 percent of the world’s GDP. This framework’s four pillars—
trade and the digital economy, supply chains and resilience, clean energy and decarbonization,

18 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

KaKKKKK

and tax and anticorruption—will allow this partnership to determine the rules of the road for an
economically vital region, and therefore the global economy.

The United States, alongside our G7 partners, launched PGII to meet the enormous infrastructure
need in low- and middle-income countries. PGII is catalyzing public and private finance to
advance climate and energy security, health and health security, digital connectivity, and gender
equality—all while creating opportunities for American businesses. We secured over $3 billion
in commitments from the Gulf Cooperation Council for projects that align with PGII goals. We
have taken a similar approach in a number of other development initiatives, also built around
multi-stakeholder coalitions that can mobilize a wide array of resources to show in various ways
that “democracy delivers,” including the longstanding President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief (PEPFAR), and the Global Fund. We are rallying the world to take bold action and raise
our collective ambition to reach the Global Fund’s $18 billion target to fight HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis, and malaria over the next three years, and requested $2 billion in our FY 2023
budget to anchor a $6 billion three-year pledge from the United States. This investment will
strengthen health systems, accelerate progress to achieve universal health coverage, and expand
the global health workforce.

The United States will work pragmatically with any partner willing to join us in constructive
problem-solving, reinforcing and building new ties based on shared interests. This includes not
just nation states, but also civil society groups, private companies, philanthropies, and sub-
national governments at home and around the world. Through proven initiatives like Gavi, the
Vaccine Alliance; new platforms that meet the moment, such as COVAX, and new historic
efforts to improve global health security financing, including the Financial Intermediary Fund for
Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response, we will forge fit-for-purpose coalitions and
public-private alliances to take on the world’s toughest challenges.

A Prosperous World

We also will build new ways to work with allies and partners on development and the expansion
of human dignity because we recognize they are integral to the security and prosperity of all
Americans. Infectious diseases, terrorism, violent extremism, irregular migration, and other
threats often emerge or accelerate due to deeper development challenges, and once they do, they
do not recognize national borders. Transnational threats, in turn, undermine development, fuel
poverty and human suffering, and feed a vicious circle.

The COVID-19 pandemic has eroded development gains and illuminated persistent inequities.
Protracted conflicts, growing fragility, a resurgence of authoritarianism, and ever-more frequent
climate shocks threaten people’s lives and livelihoods and global stability. Russia’s war against
Ukraine has only aggravated these threats, contributing to a surge in food and energy prices,
exacerbating poverty and eroding food security worldwide.

We will work to confront these shared challenges and recommit to advancing the Sustainable
Development Goals by pursuing more inclusive development partnerships, especially by putting
local partners in the driver’s seat, and by deploying a more expansive set of tools, including
catalytic financing and integrated humanitarian, development, and peacebuilding actions. We are
already applying this approach to helping vulnerable nations build resilience to the devastating
impacts of the climate crisis through the President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 19

KaKKKKK

Resilience (PREPARE) and in support of democratic renewal through the Partnerships for
Democratic Development (PDD). We are also implementing this development approach to
advance global health security and systems and to take principled humanitarian action while
addressing the root causes of fragility, conflict, and crisis, including through the Global Fragility
Act. We will use our humanitarian, development, and peacebuilding tools more cohesively. And
we will invest in women and girls, be responsive to the voices and focus on the needs of the most
marginalized, including the LGBTQI+ community; and advance inclusive development

broadly.

Across our development work, we will continue to employ best practices that distinguish the
United States and our partners from our competitors: transparency and accountability; high
environmental, social, labor, and inclusion standards; respect for human rights; and local
partnerships supported by foreign assistance and sound, sustainable financing. The international
financial institutions, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, are also a
force multiplier for our values and interests. Stronger, more stable growth abroad means a
stronger economy here at home. As other economies prosper, demand for U.S. exports of goods
and services increases, creating U.S. jobs. We will work to enhance the responsiveness of these
institutions to U.S. priorities, including how to better support developing countries as they
weather the pandemic and now the spillovers of the Russian war on Ukraine.

Modernizing and Strengthening Our Military

The American military is the strongest fighting force the world has ever known. America will not
hesitate to use force when necessary to defend our national interests. But we will do so as the last
resort and only when the objectives and mission are clear and achievable, consistent with our
values and laws, alongside non-military tools, and the mission is undertaken with the informed
consent of the American people.

Our approach to national defense is described in detail in the 2022 National Defense Strategy.
Our starting premise is that a powerful U.S. military helps advance and safeguard vital U.S.
national interests by backstopping diplomacy, confronting aggression, deterring conflict,
projecting strength, and protecting the American people and their economic interests. Amid
intensifying competition, the military’s role is to maintain and gain warfighting advantages while
limiting those of our competitors. The military will act urgently to sustain and strengthen
deterrence, with the PRC as its pacing challenge. We will make disciplined choices regarding our
national defense and focus our attention on the military’s primary responsibilities: to defend the
homeland, and deter attacks and aggression against the United States, our allies and partners,
while being prepared to fight and win the Nation’s wars should diplomacy and deterrence fail.
To do so, we will combine our strengths to achieve maximum effect in deterring acts of
aggression—an approach we refer to as integrated deterrence (see text box on page 22). We will
operate our military using a campaigning mindset—sequencing logically linked military
activities to advance strategy-aligned priorities. And, we will build a resilient force and defense
ecosystem to ensure we can perform these functions for decades to come. We ended America’s
longest war in Afghanistan, and with it an era of major military operations to remake other
societies, even as we have maintained the capacity to address terrorist threats to the American
people as they emerge.

20 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

KaKKKKK

A combat-credible military is the foundation of deterrence and America’s ability to prevail in
conflict. We will modernize the joint force to be lethal, resilient, sustainable, survivable, agile,
and responsive, prioritizing operational concepts and updated warfighting capabilities. The war
in Ukraine highlights the criticality of a vibrant Defense Industrial Base for the United States and
its allies and partners. It must not only be capable of rapidly manufacturing proven capabilities
needed to defend against adversary aggression, but also empowered to innovate and creatively
design solutions as battlefield conditions evolve. As emerging technologies transform warfare
and pose novel threats to the United States and our allies and partners, we are investing in a
range of advanced technologies including applications in the cyber and space domains, missile
defeat capabilities, trusted artificial intelligence, and quantum systems, while deploying new
capabilities to the battlefield in a timely manner. Incorporating allies and partners at every stage
of defense planning is crucial to meaningful collaboration. We also seek to remove barriers to
deeper collaboration with allies and partners, to include issues related to joint capability
development and production to safeguard our shared military-technological edge.

Nuclear deterrence remains a top priority for the Nation and foundational to integrated
deterrence. A safe, secure, and effective nuclear force undergirds our defense priorities by
deterring strategic attacks, assuring allies and partners, and allowing us to achieve our objectives
if deterrence fails. Our competitors and potential adversaries are investing heavily in new nuclear
weapons. By the 2030s, the United States for the first time will need to deter two major nuclear
powers, each of whom will field modern and diverse global and regional nuclear forces. To
ensure our nuclear deterrent remains responsive to the threats we face, we are modernizing the
nuclear Triad, nuclear command, control, and communications, and our nuclear weapons
infrastructure, as well as strengthening our extended deterrence commitments to our Allies. We
remain equally committed to reducing the risks of nuclear war. This includes taking further steps
to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our strategy and pursuing realistic goals for mutual,
verifiable arms control, which contribute to our deterrence strategy and strengthen the global
non-proliferation regime.

The most important investments are those made in the extraordinary All-Volunteer Force of the
Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, Coast Guard—together with our
Department of Defense civilian workforce. Our service members are the backbone of America’s
national defense and we are committed to their wellbeing and their families while in service and
beyond. We will maintain our foundational principle of civilian control of the military,
recognizing that healthy civil-military relations rooted in mutual respect are essential to military
effectiveness. We will strengthen the effectiveness of the force by promoting diversity and
inclusion; intensifying our suicide prevention efforts; eliminating the scourges of sexual assault,
harassment, and other forms of violence, abuse, and discrimination; and rooting out violent
extremism. We will also uphold our Nation’s sacred obligation to care for veterans and their
families when our troops return home.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 21

KaKKKKK

Integrated Deterrence

The United States has a vital interest in deterring aggression by the PRC, Russia, and other
states. More capable competitors and new strategies of threatening behavior below and above the
traditional threshold of conflict mean we cannot afford to rely solely on conventional forces and
nuclear deterrence. Our defense strategy must sustain and strengthen deterrence, with the PRC as
our pacing challenge.

Our National Defense Strategy relies on integrated deterrence: the seamless combination of
capabilities to convince potential adversaries that the costs of their hostile activities outweigh
their benefits. It entails:

e Integration across domains, recognizing that our competitors’ strategies operate across
military (land, air, maritime, cyber, and space) and non-military (economic,
technological, and information) domains—and we must too.

Integration across regions, understanding that our competitors combine expansive
ambitions with growing capabilities to threaten U.S. interests in key regions and in the
homeland.

Integration across the spectrum of conflict to prevent competitors from altering the
status quo in ways that harm our vital interests while hovering below the threshold of
armed conflict.

Integration across the U.S. Government to leverage the full array of American
advantages, from diplomacy, intelligence, and economic tools to security assistance and
force posture decisions.

Integration with allies and partners through investments in interoperability and joint
capability development, cooperative posture planning, and coordinated diplomatic and
economic approaches.

Integrated deterrence requires us to more effectively coordinate, network, and innovate so that
any competitor thinking about pressing for advantage in one domain understands that we can
respond in many others as well. This augments the traditional backstop of combat-credible
conventional and strategic capabilities, allowing us to better shape adversary perceptions of risks
and costs of action against core U.S. interests, at any time and across any domain.

PART II: OUR GLOBAL PRIORITIES

“[T]he challenges we face today are great indeed, but our capacity is greater. Our commitment
must be greater still. So let’s stand together to again declare the unmistakable resolve that
nations of the world are united still, that we stand for the values of the U.N. Charter, that we still
believe by working together we can bend the arc of history toward a freer and more just world
for all our children, although none of us have fully achieved it. We’re not passive witnesses to
history; we are the authors of history. We can do this—we have to do it—for ourselves and for

our future, for humankind.”

PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR

77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly

The steps outlined in the previous section—building our strength at home to maintain a
competitive edge; using our diplomatic power to build the strongest possible coalition to support
a world that is open, free, prosperous, and secure; and modernizing and strengthening our
military will position the United States to strengthen an international order that has delivered
broad benefits for the American people for decades and to outcompete our rivals who offer a
different vision. The breadth and complexity of our global interests mean that we need to use that
power strategically. Three interlinked lines of effort are of paramount importance—dealing with
the challenges to the international order posed by our strategic competitors, addressing shared
global challenges, and shaping the rules of the road for technology, cybersecurity, and trade and
economics.

Out-Competing China and Constraining Russia

The PRC and Russia are increasingly aligned with each other but the challenges they pose are, in
important ways, distinct. We will prioritize maintaining an enduring competitive edge over the
PRC while constraining a still profoundly dangerous Russia.

China

The PRC is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and,
increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. Beijing has
ambitions to create an enhanced sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and to become the
world’s leading power. It is using its technological capacity and increasing influence over
international institutions to create more permissive conditions for its own authoritarian model,
and to mold global technology use and norms to privilege its interests and values. Beijing
frequently uses its economic power to coerce countries. It benefits from the openness of the
international economy while limiting access to its domestic market, and it seeks to make the
world more dependent on the PRC while reducing its own dependence on the world. The PRC is

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 23

KaKKKKK

also investing in a military that is rapidly modernizing, increasingly capable in the Indo-Pacific,
and growing in strength and reach globally — all while seeking to erode U.S. alliances in the
region and around the world.

At the same time, the PRC is also central to the global economy and has a significant impact on
shared challenges, particularly climate change and global public health. It is possible for the
United States and the PRC to coexist peacefully, and share in and contribute to human progress
together.

Our strategy toward the PRC is threefold: 1) to invest in the foundations of our strength at home —
our competitiveness, our innovation, our resilience, our democracy, 2) to align our efforts with our
network of allies and partners, acting with common purpose and in common cause, and 3) compete
responsibly with the PRC to defend our interests and build our vision for the future. The first two
elements— invest and align— are described in the previous section and are essential to out-
competing the PRC in the technological, economic, political, military, intelligence, and global
governance domains.

Competition with the PRC is most pronounced in the Indo-Pacific, but it is also increasingly
global. Around the world, the contest to write the rules of the road and shape the relationships
that govern global affairs is playing out in every region and across economics, technology,
diplomacy, development, security, and global governance.

In the competition with the PRC, as in other arenas, it is clear that the next ten years will be the
decisive decade. We stand now at the inflection point, where the choices we make and the
priorities we pursue today will set us on a course that determines our competitive position long
into the future.

Many of our allies and partners, especially in the Indo-Pacific, stand on the frontlines of the
PRC’s coercion and are rightly determined to seek to ensure their own autonomy, security, and
prosperity. We will support their ability to make sovereign decisions in line with their interests
and values, free from external pressure, and work to provide high-standard and scaled
investment, development assistance, and markets. Our strategy will require us to partner with,
support, and meet the economic and development needs of partner countries, not for the sake of
competition, but for their own sake. We will act in common purpose to address a range of issues
— from untrusted digital infrastructure and forced labor in supply chains and illegal, unreported,
and unregulated fishing. We will hold Beijing accountable for abuses — genocide and crimes
against humanity in Xinjiang, human rights violations in Tibet, and the dismantling of Hong
Kong’s autonomy and freedoms — even as it seeks to pressure countries and communities into
silence. We will continue prioritizing investments in a combat credible military that deters
aggression against our allies and partners in the region, and can help those allies and partners
defend themselves.

We have an abiding interest in maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, which is
critical to regional and global security and prosperity and a matter of international concern and
attention. We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side, and do not support
Taiwan independence. We remain committed to our one China policy, which is guided by the
Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances. And we will
uphold our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act to support Taiwan’s self-defense and
to maintain our capacity to resist any resort to force or coercion against Taiwan.

24 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

KaKKKKK

Though allies and partners may have distinct perspectives on the PRC, our diplomatic approach,
and the PRC’s own behavior, has produced significant and growing opportunities to align
approaches and deliver results. Across Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America,
countries are clear-eyed about the nature of the challenges that the PRC poses. Governments
want sustainable public finances. Workers want to be treated with dignity and respect. Innovators
want to be rewarded for their ingenuity, risk-taking, and persistent efforts. And enterprising
businesses want open and free waters through which their products can be traded.

While we compete vigorously, we will manage the competition responsibly. We will seek greater
strategic stability through measures that reduce the risk of unintended military escalation,
enhance crisis communications, build mutual transparency, and ultimately engage Beijing on
more formal arms control efforts. We will always be willing to work with the PRC where our
interests align. We can’t let the disagreements that divide us stop us from moving forward on the
priorities that demand that we work together, for the good of our people and for the good of the
world. That includes on climate, pandemic threats, nonproliferation, countering illicit and illegal
narcotics, the global food crisis, and macroeconomic issues. In short, we’ll engage constructively
with the PRC wherever we can, not as a favor to us or anyone else, and never in exchange for
walking away from our principles, but because working together to solve great challenges is what the
world expects from great powers, and because it’s directly in our interest. No country should
withhold progress on existential transnational issues like the climate crisis because of bilateral
differences.

While we have profound differences with the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese
Government, those differences are between governments and systems — not between our people.
Ties of family and friendship continue to connect the American and the Chinese people. We
deeply respect their achievements, their history, and their culture. Racism and hate have no place
in a nation built by generations of immigrants to fulfill the promise of opportunity for all. And we
intend to work together to solve issues that matter most to the people of both countries.

Russia

Over the past decade, the Russian government has chosen to pursue an imperialist foreign policy
with the goal of overturning key elements of the international order. This culminated in a
full-scale invasion of Ukraine in an attempt to topple its government and bring it under Russian
control. But, this attack did not come out of the blue; it was preceded by Russia’s 2014 invasion
of Ukraine, its military intervention in Syria, its longstanding efforts to destabilize its neighbors
using intelligence and cyber capabilities, and its blatant attempts to undermine internal
democratic processes in countries across Europe, Central Asia, and around the world. Russia has
also interfered brazenly in U.S. politics and worked to sow divisions among the American
people. And Russia’s destabilizing actions are not limited to the international arena.
Domestically, the Russian government under President Putin violates its citizens’ human rights,
suppresses its opposition, and shutters independent media. Russia now has a stagnant political
system that is unresponsive to the needs of its people.

The United States, under successive administrations, made considerable efforts at multiple points
to reach out to Russia to limit our rivalry and identify pragmatic areas of cooperation. President
Putin spurned these efforts and it is now clear he will not change. Russia now poses an
immediate and persistent threat to international peace and stability. This is not about a struggle
between the West and Russia. It is about the fundamental principles of the UN Charter, which

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 25

KaKKKKK

Russia is a party to, particularly respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the prohibition
against acquiring territory through war.

We are leading a united, principled, and resolute response to Russia’s invasion and we have
rallied the world to support the Ukrainian people as they bravely defend their country. Working
with a broad and durable international coalition, we have marshalled near-record levels of
security assistance to ensure Ukraine has the means to defend itself. We have provided
humanitarian, economic and development assistance to strengthen Ukraine’s sovereign, elected
government and help the millions of refugees who have been forced to flee their homes. We will
continue to stand with the people of Ukraine as they fight back against Russia’s naked
aggression. And we will rally the world to hold Russia accountable for the atrocities they have
unleashed across Ukraine.

Alongside our allies and partners, America is helping to make Russia’s war on Ukraine a
strategic failure. Across Europe, NATO and the European Union are united in standing up to
Russia and defending shared values. We are constraining Russia’s strategic economic sectors,
including defense and aerospace, and we will continue to counter Russia’s attempts to weaken
and destabilize sovereign nations and undermine multilateral institutions. Together with our
NATO Allies, we are strengthening our defense and deterrence, particularly on the eastern flank
of the Alliance. Welcoming Finland and Sweden to NATO will further improve our security and
capabilities. And we are renewing our focus on bolstering our collective resilience against shared
threats from Russia, including asymmetric threats. More broadly, Putin’s war has profoundly
diminished Russia’s status vis-a-vis China and other Asian powers such as India and Japan.
Moscow’s soft power and diplomatic influence have waned, while its efforts to weaponize
energy have backfired. The historic global response to Russia’s war against Ukraine sends a
resounding message that countries cannot enjoy the benefits of global integration while
trampling on the core tenets of the UN Charter.

While some aspects of our approach will depend on the trajectory of the war in Ukraine, a
number of elements are already clear. First, the United States will continue to support Ukraine in
its fight for its freedom, we will help Ukraine recover economically, and we will encourage its
regional integration with the European Union. Second, the United States will defend every inch
of NATO territory and will continue to build and deepen a coalition with allies and partners to
prevent Russia from causing further harm to European security, democracy, and institutions.
Third, the United States will deter and, as necessary, respond to Russian actions that threaten
core U.S. interests, including Russian attacks on our infrastructure and our democracy. Fourth,
Russia’s conventional military will have been weakened, which will likely increase Moscow’s
reliance on nuclear weapons in its military planning. The United States will not allow Russia, or
any power, to achieve its objectives through using, or threatening to use, nuclear weapons.
America retains an interest in preserving strategic stability and developing a more expansive,
transparent, and verifiable arms control infrastructure to succeed New START and in rebuilding
European security arrangements which, due to Russia’s actions, have fallen in to disrepair.
Finally, the United States will sustain and develop pragmatic modes of interaction to handle
issues on which dealing with Russia can be mutually beneficial.

The United States respects the Russian people and their contributions to science, culture and
constructive bilateral relations over many decades. Notwithstanding the Russian government’s
strategic miscalculation in attacking Ukraine, it is the Russian people who will determine
Russia’s future as a major power capable of once more playing a constructive role in

26 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

KaKKKKK

international affairs. The United States will welcome such a future, and in the meantime, will
continue to push back against the aggression perpetrated by the Russian government.

Cooperating on Shared Challenges

The United States must maintain and increase international cooperation on shared challenges
even in an age of greater inter-state competition. In an ideal world, governments would compete
responsibly where their interests diverge and cooperate where they converge—but things have
not always worked out this way in practice. The United States, for example, has made clear that
we will not support the linkage of issues in a way that conditions cooperation on shared
challenges, but some in Beijing have been equally clear that the PRC should expect concessions
on unrelated issues as a prerequisite to cooperation on shared challenges, such as climate change.
We have also seen how the PRC chose not to cooperate adequately with the World Health
Organization and the international community on the global response to COVID-19, including
on the investigation into its origins. It also continues to endanger the world with inadequate
action on climate change domestically, particularly regarding massive coal power use and build
up.

Our strategy to tackle the shared challenges that require global cooperation involves two
simultaneous tracks: on one track, we will fully engage all countries and institutions to cooperate
on shared threats, including by pressing for reforms where institutional responses have proven
inadequate. At the same time, we will also redouble our efforts to deepen our cooperation with
like-minded partners. Across both tracks, we will also seek to harness the positive effects of
competition, promoting a race to the top, to increase international efforts on these challenges.

Climate and Energy Security

The climate crisis is the existential challenge of our time. A warming planet endangers
Americans and people around the world—trisking food and water supplies, public health, and
infrastructure and our national security. Without immediate global action to reduce emissions,
scientists tell us we will soon exceed 1.5 degrees of warming, locking in further extreme heat and
weather, rising sea levels, and catastrophic biodiversity loss.

Global action begins at home, where we are making unprecedented generational investments in
the clean energy transition through the IRA, simultaneously creating millions of good paying
jobs and strengthening American industries. We are enhancing Federal, state, and local
preparedness against and resilience to growing extreme weather threats, and we’re integrating
climate change into our national security planning and policies. This domestic work is key to our
international credibility, and to getting other countries to up their own ambition and action.

The United States is galvanizing the world and incentivizing further action. Building on the
Leaders’ Summit on Climate, Major Economies Forum, and Paris Agreement process, we are
helping countries meet and strengthen their nationally determined contributions, reduce
emissions, tackle methane and other super pollutants, promote carbon dioxide removals, adapt to
the most severe impacts of climate change, and end deforestation over the next decade. We’re
also using our economic heft to drive decarbonization. Our steel agreement with the EU, the
first-ever arrangement on steel and aluminum to address both carbon intensity and global
overcapacity, is a model for future climate-focused trade mechanisms. And we are ending public

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 27

KaKKKKK

finance for unabated coal power, and mobilizing financing to speed investments in adaptation
and the energy transition.

Events like Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine have made clear the urgent need to
accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. We know that long-term energy security depends
on clean energy. Recognizing this transition will not happen overnight, we will work with
partners and allies to ensure energy security and affordability, secure access to critical mineral
supply chains, and create a just transition for impacted workers. Through collaborative work in
the International Energy Agency, the U.S.-EU Task Force on European Energy Security, the
Clean Energy Ministerial and Mission Innovation, Power Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean Gas
Forum, the Partnership for Transatlantic Energy and Climate Cooperation, and other critical fora,
we will drive concrete action to achieve an energy secure future.

Many low-income and lower-middle income countries need assistance, especially for mitigation
and adaptation efforts. That is why we are aiming to provide over $11 billion in annual climate
funding, and are pressing partners to increase their own contributions. We are embedding climate
change into the investment strategies of our development finance institutions, including through
PGIL, and working with international organizations like the World Bank and regional
development banks to do the same.

Pandemics and Biodefense

COVID-19 has killed nearly 6.5 million people around the world, including more than | million
Americans, but the next pandemic could be much worse—as contagious but more lethal. We
have a narrow window of opportunity to take steps nationally and internationally to prepare for
the next pandemic and to strengthen our biodefense.

In the United States, that requires preparing for catastrophic biological risks, including by
improving early warning and disease surveillance, data sharing and forecasting; speeding
development, domestic manufacturing, and delivery of medical countermeasures; advancing safe
biotechnology development and manufacturing; and overcoming inequities in care quality and
access.

Internationally, it requires action on multiple fronts. The United States has recommitted to
COVAX, to which we are the largest donor, the World Health Organization, and a cooperative
approach toward global health security. We recognize that no one is safe until everyone is safe,
which is why we have donated more vaccines internationally than any other country, with no
political strings attached. We are working with allies and partners, including philanthropic
organizations and the private sector, to boost sustainable vaccine manufacturing in Africa and
South Asia.

We recognize that we must engage with all countries on global public health, including those
with whom we disagree, because pandemics know no borders. We also acknowledge that some
of our international institutions have fallen short in the past and need to be reformed. While we
believe that many of these reforms can be agreed upon and implemented over the lifetime of this
administration, we also recognize that ultimately some may fall short because other countries do
not share our belief in greater transparency and sharing critical data with the international
community. Therefore, as we engage globally and through international institutions, we will also
deepen our cooperation with like-minded states to push for reforms on pandemic preparedness
and if necessary to work more closely together to set higher standards that others can emulate.

28 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

KaKKKKK

We will also tackle the increasing risk posed by deliberate and accidental biological risks,
including through our ability to rapidly detect, identify, and attribute agents, and to develop
medical countermeasures. Working with partners and allies, we will strengthen the Biological
Weapons Convention to deter state biological warfare capabilities; prevent terrorist acquisition
or use of biological weapons; and reinforce international norms against biological weapons’
development and use. We will also reduce biological risks associated with advancements in
technologies and dual-use research and development, including by establishing and
strengthening international biosafety and biosecurity norms and practices.

Food Insecurity

Global food systems today are under threat from a variety of sources, including Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine, the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate events, and
protracted conflicts—all of which threaten to push 75-95 million more people into extreme
poverty in 2022 than were expected before the pandemic. The food insecurity crisis has become
particularly dangerous because of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, which took much of
Ukraine’s grain off the market and exacerbated an already worsening global food insecurity
problem. To address the needs of the hundreds of millions of people now suffering as a result,
the United States is providing more humanitarian assistance than ever before. We remain the
largest contributor to the World Food Programme and the leading donor in nearly every country
experiencing a humanitarian food crisis.

Over the longer term, we are rallying the world to find ways to deal with the broad set of
challenges for the world’s food supply achieving sustained global food security demands
constant vigilance and action by all governments, in partnership with multilateral institutions and
non-governmental organizations. Working together with our partners, we launched the Roadmap
for Global Food Security: A Call to Action which urges the more than 100 signatory states to
take several actions including keeping food and agricultural markets open, increasing fertilizer
production, and investing in climate-resilient agriculture. The United States is also implementing
the Global Food Security Strategy, which focuses on reducing global poverty, hunger, and
malnutrition by supporting inclusive and sustainable agriculture-led economic growth;
strengthening resilience among people and food systems; and supporting well-nourished healthy
populations, especially among women and children. This requires working across entire food
systems to consider every step from cultivation to consumption, and to integrate these efforts
within larger climate, health, conflict mitigation, and peacebuilding work. To ensure these efforts
are durable and sustainable requires centering equity and inclusion, and partnering both with
local partners and international bodies. Going forward, the United States must continue to
address both acute needs and work collaboratively to build sustained food security for the long
term.

Arms Control and Non-Proliferation

Nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons proliferation is a vitally important and enduring
global challenge, requiring sustained collaboration to prevent the spread of weapons of mass
destruction and fissile material, their means of delivery, and enabling technologies. The

United States will work with allies and partners, civil society, and international organizations to
strengthen arms control and nonproliferation mechanisms, especially during times of conflict
when escalation risks are greater. We will address the existential threat posed by the proliferation

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 29

KaKKKKK

of nuclear weapons through renewed arms control and nonproliferation leadership. We will
continue to seek pragmatic engagement with competitors about strategic stability and risk
reduction. Our approach will emphasize measures that head off costly arms races, reduce the
likelihood of miscalculation, and complement US. and allied deterrence strategies.

We will lead bilateral and multilateral arms control efforts and strengthen existing regimes,
frameworks, and institutions, including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty Organization, International Atomic Energy Agency, and other United Nations
bodies, to extend the more than seven-decade record of nuclear non-use. We will support the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the Biological Weapons Convention
and reinforce norms against the possession and use of chemical and biological weapons. We will
continue to lead the world in coordinated efforts to lock down nuclear and radiological materials
and prevent terrorist acquisition. And we will ensure multilateral export control regimes are
equipped to address destabilizing emerging technologies and to align export policies in
likeminded states toward countries of concern.

Terrorism

Today’s terrorist threat is more ideologically diverse and geographically diffuse than that of two
decades ago. Al-Qa‘ida, ISIS, and associated forces have expanded from Afghanistan and the
Middle East into Africa and Southeast Asia.

Syria, Yemen, and Somalia remain terrorist sanctuaries; local affiliates have become entrenched
actors in regional conflicts. Many of these groups still intend to carry out or inspire others to
attack the United States and our interests abroad, even as years of sustained counterterrorism and
law enforcement pressure have constrained their capabilities, and enhanced security measures
and information sharing have improved our defenses. Meanwhile, we face sharply increased
threats from a range of domestic violent extremists here in the United States.

America remains steadfast in protecting our country and our people and facilities overseas from
the full spectrum of terrorism threats that we face in the 21st century. As the threat evolves, so
too must our counterterrorism approach. To that end, last year, we ended America’s longest war,
in Afghanistan, having long ago achieved our objective of delivering justice to Osama Bin Laden
and other key leadership of al-Qa’ida. We are confident in our ability to maintain the fight
against al-Qa’ida, ISIS, and associated forces from over the horizon, as we demonstrated with
the operation to kill Ayman al-Zawahiri. We will ensure Afghanistan never again serves as a safe
haven for terrorist attacks on the United States or our allies and we will hold the Taliban
accountable for its public commitments on counterterrorism.

Around the world, we will increase cooperation and support to trusted partners, shifting from a
strategy that is “U.S.-led, partner-enabled” to one that is “partner-led, U.S.-enabled.” That
requires building or expanding systems to prevent, detect, and respond to threats as they
develop—including by strengthening partners’ law enforcement and judicial systems, improving
threat information sharing, enhancing border security, countering terrorist financing, targeting
terrorist prevention and extremist disengagement programming, and preventing online and
offline terrorist recruitment and mobilization to violence. It also necessitates addressing the root
causes of radicalization by leveraging U.S. and partner efforts to support effective governance,
promote stabilization and economic development, and resolve ongoing conflicts.

30 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

KaKKKKK

Where necessary, we will use force to disrupt and degrade terrorist groups that are plotting
attacks against the United States, our people, or our diplomatic and military facilities abroad. We
will do so consistent with domestic and international law and in a manner that minimizes civilian
casualties, while promoting greater transparency and accountability. We are committed to
continuing to work with the Congress to replace outdated authorizations for the use of military
force with a narrow and specific framework appropriate to ensure that we can continue to protect
Americans from terrorist threats. Here at home, we will continue to work with state, local, tribal,
and territorial partners and the private sector to share information and disrupt terrorist plots that
threaten our citizens.

We face an increased and significant threat within the United States from a range of domestic
violent extremists, including those motivated by racial or ethnic prejudice, as well as anti-
government or anti-authority sentiment. Continuing to implement our first-ever National
Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism will enable us to better understand and share
information regarding the domestic terrorist threat, prevent recruitment and mobilization to
violence, and disrupt and deter domestic terrorist activity and any transnational linkages—all
while reinforcing respect for civil rights and civil liberties. Already, we are providing more and
better information on domestic violent extremist threats to state, local, territorial, and tribal
partners, and using new mechanisms, such as smartphone-based applications, to do so in real
time. We are investing millions of dollars in data-driven violence prevention efforts, including
through grant programs available to Federal, state, territorial, tribal, and nonprofit partners, as
well as to houses of worship as they face increased threats. We are working with like-minded
governments, civil society, and the technology sector to address terrorist and violent extremist
content online, including through innovative research collaborations. And we are confronting the
long-term contributors to domestic violent extremist threats, including working with Congress to
advance commonsense gun laws and policies, and addressing the crisis of disinformation and
misinformation, often channeled through social and other media platforms, that can fuel extreme
polarization and lead some individuals to violence.

Combatting Transnational Organized Crime

Transnational organized crime impacts a growing number of victims while amplifying other
consequential global challenges, from migration to cyber-attacks. Transnational criminal
organizations (TCOs) are involved in activities such as the trafficking of drugs and other illicit
goods, money laundering, theft, human smuggling and trafficking, cybercrime, fraud, corruption,
and illegal fishing and mining. These activities feed violence in our communities, endanger
public safety and health, and contribute to tens of thousands of drug-overdose deaths in the
United States each year. They degrade the security and stability of our neighbors and partners by
undermining the rule of law, fostering corruption, acting as proxies for hostile state activities,
and exploiting and endangering vulnerable populations. We will accelerate our efforts to curb the
threat posed by transnational organized crime, integrating the vital work of law enforcement with
diplomatic, financial, intelligence, and other tools, and in coordination with foreign partners. As
part of this effort, we will work to reduce the availability of illicit drugs in the United States,
especially the growing scourge of fentanyl and methamphetamines, by bringing all the tools of
government to bear to interdict drugs and disrupt TCO’s supply chains and the financial
networks that enable their corrosive activities. Recognizing that this is a problem with global
reach we will work closely with our international partners to stop TCOs from getting precursor
chemicals and work closely with private industry to increase vigilance and prevent the diversion
of chemicals for illicit fentanyl production.

 

Shaping the Rules of the Road

Since 1945, the United States has led the creation of institutions, norms, and standards to govern
international trade and investment, economic policy, and technology. These mechanisms
advanced America’s economic and geopolitical aims and benefited people around the world by
shaping how governments and economies interacted—and did so in ways that aligned with U.S
interests and values. These mechanisms have not kept pace with economic or technological
changes, and today risk being irrelevant, or in certain cases, actively harmful to solving the
challenges we now face—from insecure supply chains to widening inequality to the abuses of the
PRC’s nonmarket economic actions. We are endeavoring to strengthen and update the UN
system and multilateral institutions generally. Nowhere is this need more acute than in updating
the rules of the road for technology, cyberspace, trade, and economics.

By doing so in close coordination with our allies and partners, we will establish fair rules while
also sustaining our economic and technological edge and shape a future defined by fair
competition—because when American workers and companies compete on a level playing field,
they win.

Technology

Technology is central to today’s geopolitical competition and to the future of our national
security, economy and democracy. U.S. and allied leadership in technology and innovation has
long underpinned our economic prosperity and military strength. In the next decade, critical and
emerging technologies are poised to retool economies, transform militaries, and reshape the

32 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

KaKKKKK

world. The United States is committed to a future where these technologies increase the security,
prosperity, and values of the American people and like-minded democracies. Our technology
strategy will enable the United States and like-minded democracies to work together to pioneer
new medicines that can cure diseases, increase the production of healthy foods that are
sustainably grown, diversify and strengthen our manufacturing supply chains, and secure energy
without reliance on fossil fuels, all while delivering new jobs and security for the American
people and our allies and partners. With bipartisan support, we have launched a modern
industrial strategy and already secured historic investments in clean energy, microelectronics
manufacturing, research, and development, and biotechnology, and we will work with Congress
to fully fund historic new authorizations for research and development. We also are doubling
down on our longstanding and asymmetric strategic advantage: attracting and retaining the
world’s best talent. Attracting a higher volume of global STEM talent is a priority for our
national security and supply chain security, so we will aggressively implement recent visa
actions and work with Congress to do more.

These investments will enable the United States to anchor an allied techno-industrial base that
will safeguard our shared security, prosperity and values. This means working with allies and
partners to harness and scale new technologies, and promote the foundational technologies of the
21st century, especially microelectronics, advanced computing and quantum technologies,
artificial intelligence, biotechnology and biomanufacturing, advanced telecommunications, and
clean energy technologies. We also will partner with like-minded nations to co-develop and
deploy technologies in a way that benefits all, not only the powerful, and build robust and
durable supply chains so that countries cannot use economic warfare to coerce others.

We are already rallying like-minded actors to advance an international technology ecosystem
that protects the integrity of international standards development and promotes the free flow of
data and ideas with trust, while protecting our security, privacy, and human rights, and enhancing
our competitiveness. That includes work through the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council to
foster transatlantic coordination on semiconductor and critical mineral supply chains, trustworthy
artificial intelligence, disinformation, the misuse of technology threatening security and human
rights, export controls, and investment screening, as well as through the Indo-Pacific Quad on
critical and emerging technologies, open, next-generation digital infrastructure, and people-to-
people exchanges. Across this work, we seek to bolster U.S. and allied technology leadership,
advance inclusive and responsible technology development, close regulatory and legal gaps,
strengthen supply chain security, and enhance cooperation on privacy, data sharing, and digital
trade.

We must ensure strategic competitors cannot exploit foundational American and allied
technologies, know-how, or data to undermine American and allied security. We are therefore
modernizing and strengthening our export control and investment screening mechanisms, and
also pursuing targeted new approaches, such as screening of outbound investment, to prevent
strategic competitors from exploiting investments and expertise in ways that threaten our
national security, while also protecting the integrity of allied technological ecosystems and
markets. We will also work to counter the exploitation of American’s sensitive data and
illegitimate use of technology, including commercial spyware and surveillance technology, and
we will stand against digital authoritarianism.

To achieve these goals, the digital backbones of the modern economy must be open, trusted,
interoperable, reliable, and secure. That requires working with a broad range of partners to

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 33

Kk kk KK

advance network infrastructure resilience in 5G and other advanced communication
technologies, including by promoting vendor diversity and securing supply chains. These
investments cannot just be made in wealthy countries; we must also focus on providing high-
quality digital infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries, bridging digital divides by
emphasizing access among marginalized groups. To ensure these investments support positive
technological outcomes, we will partner with industry and governments in shaping technological
standards that ensure quality, consumer safety, and global interoperability, and to advance the
open and transparent standards process that has enabled innovation, growth, and
interconnectivity for decades. And in all that we do we will strive to ensure that technology
supports, and does not undermine, democracy, and is developed, deployed, and governed in
accordance with human rights.

Securing Cyberspace

Our societies, and the critical infrastructure that supports them, from power to pipelines, is
increasingly digital and vulnerable to disruption or destruction via cyber attacks. Such attacks
have been used by countries, such as Russia, to undermine countries’ ability to deliver services to
citizens and coerce populations. We are working closely with allies and partners, such as the
Quad, to define standards for critical infrastructure to rapidly improve our cyber resilience, and
building collective capabilities to rapidly respond to attacks. In the face of disruptive cyber
attacks from criminals, we have launched innovative partnerships, to expand law enforcement
cooperation, deny sanctuary to cyber criminals and counter illicit use of cryptocurrency to
launder the proceeds of cybercrime. As an open society, the United States has a clear interest in
strengthening norms that mitigate cyber threats and enhance stability in cyberspace. We aim to
deter cyber attacks from state and non state actors and will respond decisively with all
appropriate tools of national power to hostile acts in cyberspace, including those that disrupt or
degrade vital national functions or critical infrastructure. We will continue to promote adherence
to the UN General Assembly-endorsed framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace,
which recognizes that international law applies online, just as it does offline.

Trade and Economics

America’s prosperity also relies on a fair and open trade and international economic system. The
United States has long benefited from international trade’s ability to promote global economic
growth, lower consumer prices, and access to foreign markets to promote U.S. exports and jobs.
At the same time, the longstanding rules that govern trade and other means of economic
exchange have been violated by non-market actors, like the PRC; were designed to privilege
corporate mobility over workers and the environment, thereby exacerbating inequality and the
climate crisis; and fail to cover the frontiers of the modern economy, including digital trade. The
United States must once again rally partners around rules for creating a level playing field that
will enable American workers and businesses—and those of partners and allies around the
world—to thrive.

As our recent work to create IPEF and the Americas Prosperity for Economic Prosperity show,
we are working to update the current trading system to promote equitable and resilient growth—
encouraging robust trade, countering anticompetitive practices, bringing worker voices to the
decision-making table, and ensuring high labor and environmental standards. We will seek new
export opportunities that benefit American workers and companies, especially small- and

34 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

KaKKKKK

medium-sized enterprises, push back on abuses by non-market economies, and enforce rules
against unfair trade and labor practices, including intellectual property theft, discriminatory
regulations, forced labor, the denial of the right to organize, and other forms of labor repression.
We will also use trade tools to advance climate priorities, as we are doing with the landmark
steel and aluminum agreement with the EU. These arrangements will be accompanied by real
adjustment assistance, ensuring all Americans have a dignified place in our shared future. Taken
together, these efforts will create growth and innovation that benefits not only Americans, but
people around the world.

Beyond trade, we are working to build an international economic system fit for contemporary
realities. We will tackle the harms caused to U.S. workers, consumers, and businesses by
currency manipulation; counter corruption and illicit finance; and end the race to the bottom for
corporate taxation through promotion of the OECD’s Global Minimum Tax. We will partner
with countries on sustainable development, including by responding to global debt challenges
and financing quality infrastructure through PGII. We will explore the merits and responsibly
lead development of digital assets, including a digital dollar, with high standards and protections
for stability, privacy, and security to benefit a strong and inclusive U.S. financial system and
reinforce its global primacy. And we will address growth-stymying legal, structural, and cultural
barriers that undermine labor force participation for women and marginalized groups. We will
also support efforts by the international financial institutions will also need to continue to evolve
to meet the challenges of our times. Many of the biggest challenges in our world today—such as
pandemics and health, climate change, fragility, migration and refugee flows—cross borders and
disproportionately affect the poorest, most vulnerable populations. Bolstering these institutions is
also critical to tackling serious long-term challenges to the international order, such as those
posed by the PRC.

Hostages and Wrongful Detainees

Using human beings as pawns is antithetical to American values and to the global order to which
we aspire. Yet, that is what governments, regimes, and non-state actors do when they hold
Americans against their will as hostages and wrongful detainees. We are working with our
partners to deter and thwart those inhumane tactics. That includes our issuance in July 2022 of an
executive order implementing a recent U.S. law called the Levinson Act and unlocking new tools
for punishing those who wrongfully kidnap or detain Americans abroad. And it includes working
with key international partners to promote and implement the Canadian-launched Declaration
Against Arbitrary Detention in State-to-State Relations so as to turn the tide against this
inhumane practice and forge international norms against it.

Countering Corruption

Corruption poses a fundamental threat to the rule of law. When government officials abuse
public power for private gain, it degrades the business environment, subverts economic
opportunity, and exacerbates inequality. Corruption also contributes to reduced public trust in
state institutions, which in turn can add to the appeal of illiberal actors who exploit popular
grievances for political advantage. In today’s globalized world, international financial systems
are used to stash illicit wealth abroad and to send bribes across borders. The United States
Strategy on Countering Corruption recognizes the unique threat corruption poses to our national
security and places a special emphasis on recognizing the ways in which corrupt actors have
used the U.S. financial system and other rule-of-law based systems to launder their ill-gotten
gains. In response to Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine, the United States ramped up its
kleptocracy initiatives aimed at recovering corruption proceeds as well as both identifying and
repatriating the laundered proceeds of crime. Finally, the United States will elevate and expand
the scale of diplomatic engagement and foreign assistance, including by enhancing partner
governments’ capacitates to fight corruption in cooperation with U.S. law enforcement
authorities and bolstering the prevention and oversight capacities of willing governments.

“There’s a fundamental truth of the 21st century within each of our own countries and as a

for our own people, we must also engage deeply with the rest of the world. To ensure that our
own future, we must work together with other partners—our partners—toward a shared future.

Our security, our prosperity, and our very freedoms are interconnected, in my view, as never

,

before. And so, I believe we must work together as never before.’

PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly

The United States can meet the challenges of this decisive decade only by partnering with
countries and people around the world. Americans rely on and benefit from our broad and deep
relationships in every region; invest in and trade with nearly every country; and study, work, and
live on every continent. Our future and the world’s are interlinked. That is why our strategy is
global.

Promote a Free and Open Indo-Pacific

The Indo-Pacific fuels much of the world’s economic growth and will be the epicenter of
21st century geopolitics. As an Indo-Pacific power, the United States has a vital interest in
realizing a region that is open, interconnected, prosperous, secure, and resilient.

The United States will work with other regional states to keep the Indo-Pacific open and
accessible and ensure that nations are free to make their own choices, consistent with obligations
under international law. We support open societies through investments in democratic
institutions, free press, and civil society and are cooperating with partners to counter information
manipulation and corruption. And we will affirm freedom of the seas and build shared regional
support for open access to the South China Sea—a throughway for nearly two-thirds of global
maritime trade and a quarter of all global trade.

A free and open Indo-Pacific can only be achieved if we build collective capacity. We are
deepening our five regional treaty alliances and closest partnerships. We affirm the centrality of
ASEAN, and seek deeper bonds with Southeast Asian partners. We will expand our regional
diplomatic, development, and economic engagement, with a particular focus on Southeast Asia
and the Pacific Islands. As we work with South Asian regional partners to address climate
change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the PRC’s coercive behavior, we will promote prosperity
and economic connectivity across the Indian Ocean region. The Quad and AUKUS will also be
critical to addressing regional challenges, and we will further reinforce our collective strength by
weaving our allies and partners closer together—including by encouraging tighter linkages
between likeminded Indo-Pacific and European countries.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 37

KaKKKKK

The prosperity of everyday Americans is linked to the Indo-Pacific and the United States has
long been a regional trade and investment leader. With our regional partners, we are developing
IPEF to drive inclusive, broad-based prosperity and advance our shared interests in resilient, fair,
digital, and low-carbon economies. Leadership through Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) will complement these efforts.

For 75 years, the United States has maintained a strong and consistent defense presence and will
continue to meaningfully contribute to the region’s stability and peace. We reaffirm our iron-clad
commitments to our Indo-Pacific treaty allies—Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the
Philippines, and Thailand—and we will continue to modernize these alliances. We reaffirm our
unwavering commitment to the defense of Japan under our mutual security treaty, which covers
the Senkaku Islands. As India is the world’s largest democracy and a Major Defense Partner, the
United States and India will work together, bilaterally and multilaterally, to support our shared
vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific. We will seek sustained diplomacy with North Korea to
make tangible progress toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while
strengthening extended deterrence in the face of North Korean weapons of mass destruction and
missile threats. The brutal military coup in Burma has undermined regional stability, and we will
continue working closely with allies and partners, including ASEAN, to help restore Burma’s
democratic transition.

We will also work to enhance partners’ resilience to transnational challenges, including climate
and biological threats. The Indo-Pacific is the epicenter of the climate crisis but is also essential
to climate solutions, and our shared responses to the climate crisis are a political imperative and
an economic opportunity. We are also partnering to help the region build resilience to pandemic
disease and to strengthen their health systems, drive investments in global health security, and
expand the region’s ability to prevent, detect, and respond to emergencies.

We have entered a consequential new period of American foreign policy that will demand more
of the United States in the Indo-Pacific than has been asked of us since the Second World War.
No region will be of more significance to the world and to everyday Americans than the
Indo-Pacific. We are ambitious because we know that we and our allies and partners hold a
common vision for its future.

Deepen Our Alliance with Europe

With a relationship rooted in shared democratic values, common interests, and historic ties, the
transatlantic relationship is a vital platform on which many other elements of our foreign policy
are built. Europe has been, and will continue to be, our foundational partner in addressing the full
range of global challenges. To effectively pursue a common global agenda, we are broadening
and deepening the transatlantic bond—strengthening NATO, raising the level of ambition in the
U.S.-EU relationship, and standing with our European allies and partners in defense of the
tules-based system that underpins our security, prosperity, and values.

Today, Europe stands at the front lines of the fight to defend the principles of freedom,
sovereignty, and non-aggression, and we will continue to work in lockstep to ensure that freedom
prevails. America remains unequivocally committed to collective defense as enshrined in
NATO?’s Article 5 and will work alongside our NATO Allies to deter, defend against, and build
resilience to aggression and coercion in all its forms. As we step up our own sizable

38 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

contributions to NATO capabilities and readiness—including by strengthening defensive forces
and capabilities, and upholding our long-standing commitment to extended deterrence—we will
count on our Allies to continue assuming greater responsibility by increasing their spending,
capabilities, and contributions. European defense investments, through or complementary to
NATO, will be critical to ensuring our shared security at this time of intensifying competition.
We stand behind NATO’s continued adaptation to modern security challenges, including its
emphasis on defense in cyberspace, climate security, and the growing security risks presented by
the PRC’s policies and actions.

America maintains our fundamental commitment to the pursuit of a Europe that is whole, free,
and at peace. Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine poses a grave threat to this vision, which is
why we are determined to support Ukraine in defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity
while imposing severe costs on Moscow for its aggression. We have supported Ukraine with
security, humanitarian, and financial assistance. We have joined with allies and partners in
Europe and around the globe to impose sanctions and export controls that will degrade Russia’s
ability to wage future wars of aggression. We have partnered with the European Commission on
an ambitious plan to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels, strengthen European
energy security, and advance shared climate goals. Across these efforts, the EU—an integrated
market of over 450 million people—is an indispensable partner, and we support efforts to foster
EU unity. We also encourage close cooperation on matters of mutual interest between the EU
and the United Kingdom. In addition, we underscore our support for the Good Friday Agreement
which is the bedrock of peace, stability, and prosperity in Northern Ireland.

As we support Ukraine, we will also work to enhance the stability and resilience of other
democracies. We will support the European aspirations of Georgia and Moldova and their
commitment to important institutional reforms. We will assist partners in strengthening
democratic institutions, the rule of law, and economic development in the Western Balkans. We
will back diplomatic efforts to resolve conflict in the South Caucasus. We will continue to
engage with Turkey to reinforce its strategic, political, economic, and institutional ties to the
West. We will work with allies and partners to manage the refugee crisis created by Russia’s war
in Ukraine. And, we will work to forestall terrorist threats to Europe. Elsewhere in Eurasia, we
will continue to support the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Central Asia.
We will foster efforts to enhance resilience and democratic development in the five countries in
this region. We will continue to work through the C5+1 diplomatic platform (Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and the United States) to advance
climate adaptation, improve regional energy and food security, enhance integration within the
region, and build greater connectivity to global markets.

Though rooted in transatlantic strength and stability, our agenda with European allies and
partners is global. We will work with the EU to strengthen trade, investment, and technological
cooperation grounded in shared democratic values—promoting an open and inclusive global
economy, setting high standards for trade, ensuring fair competition, supporting labor rights,
driving decarbonization, fighting corruption, and protecting our innovations from uses that run
counter to our interests and values. Through the G7, we will work with France, Germany, Italy,
and the United Kingdom to galvanize international cooperation on the world’s most pressing
challenges. We will jointly defend human rights, whether in Belarus or Xinjiang. To enact this
ambitious agenda, we will deepen our strategic alignment—consulting regularly, sharing
information and intelligence, and acting together.

Foster Democracy and Shared Prosperity in the Western
Hemisphere

No region impacts the United States more directly than the Western Hemisphere. With

$1.9 trillion in annual trade, shared values and democratic traditions, and familial bonds, nations
of the Western Hemisphere, especially in North America, are key contributors to U.S. prosperity
and resilience. But the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing recession have exacerbated
longstanding structural challenges, fueled political and social unrest, undermining faith in
democracy’s ability to deliver, and spurred unprecedented levels of irregular migration to the
United States and throughout the region. Recognizing the direct link between the region’s
prosperity and security and that of our own, it is vital for the United States to revitalize our
partnerships to build and preserve economic resilience, democratic stability, and citizen security
within the hemisphere. We will advance these efforts through regular interactions, multilateral
and institutional collaboration, and regional initiatives, and by implementing the commitments
made at the Ninth Summit of the Americas.

The movement of people throughout the Americas, including over six million Venezuelans
forced to leave their homes since 2015, affects all of Latin America and the Caribbean and
reinforces the need for regional action. The Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and
Protection complements U.S. efforts at home to modernize its border infrastructure and build a
fair, orderly, and humane immigration system with a bold hemisphere-wide partnership centered
on the principle of responsibility-sharing, stability and assistance for affected communities, the
expansion of legal pathways, humane migration management, and a coordinated emergency
response. The United States is also leading the charge to expand legal pathways for migration
and to combat illicit haman smuggling and trafficking that prey on vulnerable migrants. These
efforts combined aim to stabilize migrant populations and replace irregular migration with
orderly flows that can fuel economic growth in the United States and across the region. We will
pursue these collaborative efforts while ensuring a fundamentally fair, orderly, and humane
approach to migration management that bolster border security and protects our nation.

Ending and mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and advancing health security are
imperative for the wellbeing of the entire hemisphere. In addition to donating over 72 million
vaccines, through the Action Plan on Health and Resilience in the Americas we are partnering
with the region to prevent, prepare for, and respond to future pandemic threats and other public
health emergencies while also expanding the equitable delivery of healthcare and public services
to remote, vulnerable, and marginalized populations. In addition to supporting countries,
especially in Central America and the Caribbean, in reaching a 70 percent COVID-19
vaccination rate, associated partnerships are boosting increased vaccine manufacturing capability
and helping train 500,000 public health and medical professionals by 2027 through the Americas
Health Corps.

Together with regional partners we are deepening economic cooperation to ensure durable and
inclusive economic growth that delivers for our working people. Our priority is to work with
Canada and Mexico to advance a North American vision for the future that draws on our shared
strengths and bolsters U.S. global competitiveness. Similarly, the Americas Partnership for
Economic Prosperity will guide our regional economic engagement by focusing on the largest
drivers of bottom-up and middle-out growth, updating tools for the new and complex challenges
facing us today and in the decades to come with a focus on reinvigorating regional economic

40 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

institutions, securing supply chains, creating clean energy jobs and promoting decarbonization,
ensuring sustainable and inclusive trade, and making game-changing investments that increase
the effectiveness of public administration.

Tackling the climate crisis and harnessing the dynamism of the region will be central to our
approach, and we will use mitigation and adaptation efforts to fuel a sustainable economic
recovery and protect forest ecosystems, including by promoting trade and investment in clean
energy to achieve a collective target of 70 percent installed capacity for renewable energy
generation in the region’s electricity sector by 2030 and mobilizing financing and other forms of
support to promote conservation of the Amazon. The United States and the Caribbean
Community also launched the Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis 2030 to expand access
to project financing, attract private investment in clean energy infrastructure and climate
adaptation projects, and enhance local capacity to assess, plan for, predict, mitigate, and respond
to extreme weather events and related risks in a changing climate.

The United States derives security and economic benefits from the region’s democratic stability
and institutions, as our shared values provide a basis for collaboration and peaceful dispute
resolution. To help preserve and enhance these traditions, we will support partners striving to
build transparent, inclusive, and accountable institutions. Together, we will support effective
democratic governance responsive to citizen needs, defend human rights and combat
gender-based violence, tackle corruption, and protect against external interference or coercion,
including from the PRC, Russia, or Iran. Through reinvigorated and representative
Inter-American institutions, and in partnership with civil society and other governments, we will
support democratic self-determination for the people of Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and any
country where the popular will is suppressed. In Haiti, which suffers from an extended
humanitarian, political, and economic crisis, we will mobilize the international community to
help restore security, rebuild governing institutions, and support a foundation of prosperity by
which the Haitian people can determine their own future.

We will also assist partners in facing security threats. These challenges may be internal—
including from local gangs, or transnational, including from criminal organizations that traffic
drugs and humans and undertake other illegal operations—or external, as malign actors seek to
gain military or intelligence footholds in the region. These threats impact security throughout the
Americas, including here at home, and we will therefore promote collaboration to help assist
civilian police and, strengthen justice systems in the Americas, and expand information sharing
with our partners.

These priorities—expanding economic opportunities, strengthening democracy, and building
security—are mutually reinforcing and contribute to national, regional, and global stability. We
have an overriding strategic interest in pursuing and strengthening collaboration through
intensified diplomatic engagement with hemispheric partners and institutions based on the
premise that advance a vision of a region that is secure, middle class, and democratic is
fundamentally in the national security interest of the United States. The challenge and the stakes
of this undertaking are accentuated by the backdrop of increased geopolitical and geoeconomics
volatility, the interrelated challenges posed by phenomena like climate change, global
pandemics, and mass migration, and the recognition that the security and prosperity of the
United States hinges on that of our neighbors.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 41

KaKKKKK

Support De-Escalation and Integration in the Middle East

Over the past two decades, U.S. foreign policy has focused predominantly on threats emanating
from the Middle East and North Africa. We have too often defaulted to military-centric policies
underpinned by an unrealistic faith in force and regime change to deliver sustainable outcomes,
while failing to adequately account for opportunity costs to competing global priorities or
unintended consequences. It is time to eschew grand designs in favor of more practical steps that
can advance U.S. interests and help regional partners lay the foundation for greater stability,
prosperity, and opportunity for the people of the Middle East and for the American people.

The United States has set forth a new framework for U.S. policy in the region based on
America’s unparalleled comparative advantage in building partnerships, coalitions, and alliances
to strengthen deterrence, while using diplomacy to de-escalate tensions, reduce risks of new
conflicts, and set a long-term foundation for stability.

This framework has five principles. First, the United States will support and

strengthen partnerships with countries that subscribe to the rules-based international order, and
we will make sure those countries can defend themselves against foreign threats. Second,

the United States will not allow foreign or regional powers to jeopardize freedom of navigation
through the Middle East’s waterways, including the Strait of Hormuz and the Bab al Mandab,
nor tolerate efforts by any country to dominate another—or the region—through military
buildups, incursions, or threats. Third, even as the United States works to deter threats to
regional stability, we will work to reduce tensions, de-escalate, and end conflicts wherever
possible through diplomacy. Fourth, the United States will promote regional integration by
building political, economic, and security connections between and among U.S. partners,
including through integrated air and maritime defense structures, while respecting each country’s
sovereignty and independent choices. Fifth, the United States will always promote human rights
and the values enshrined in the UN Charter.

This new framework builds on the recent progress regional states have made to bridge their
enduring divides. We will continue to work with allies and partners to enhance their capabilities
to deter and counter Iran’s destabilizing activities. We will pursue diplomacy to ensure that Iran
can never acquire a nuclear weapon, while remaining postured and prepared to use other means
should diplomacy fail. Iran’s threats against U.S. personnel as well as current and former U.S.
officials will not be tolerated, and as we have demonstrated, we will respond when our people
and interests are attacked. As we do so, we will always stand with the Iranian people striving for
the basic rights and dignity long denied them by the regime in Tehran.

More broadly we will combine diplomacy, economic aid, and security assistance to local
partners to alleviate suffering, reduce instability, and prevent the export of terrorism or mass
migration from Yemen, Syria, and Libya, while working with regional governments to manage
the broader impact of these challenges. We will seek to extend and deepen Israel’s growing ties
to its neighbors and other Arab states, including through the Abraham Accords, while
maintaining our ironclad commitment to its security. We will also continue to promote a viable
two state solution that preserves Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state while meeting
Palestinian aspirations for a secure and viable state of their own. As President Biden stated
during his visit to the West Bank in July 2022, “Two States along the 1967 lines, with mutually
agreed swaps, remain the best way to achieve equal measure of security, prosperity, freedom,
and democracy for Palestinians as well as Israelis.”

42 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

KaKKKKK

This new framework relies on a sustainable and effective military posture focused on deterrence,
strengthening partner capacity, enabling regional security integration, countering terrorist threats,
and ensuring the free flow of global commerce. In conjunction with the use of other instruments
of national power, these military activities also help counter external actors’ military expansion
in the region. We will not use our military to change regimes or remake societies, but instead
limit the use of force to circumstances where it is necessary to protect our national security
interests and consistent with international law, while enabling our partners to defend their
territory from external and terrorist threats.

We will encourage economic and political reforms that help unlock the region’s potential,
including by fostering greater economic integration to drive growth and create jobs. We will
encourage energy producers to use their resources to stabilize global energy markets, while also
preparing for a clean energy future and protecting American consumers. We will also continue to
support our democratic partners and demand accountability for violations of human rights,
recognizing that while true reform can only come from within, the United States still has an
important role to play. The United States is the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance
and a longstanding champion for principled, needs-based humanitarian action. We will sustain
our leadership on humanitarian assistance and manage long-term refugee and displacement
crises, which help realize human dignity and bolster stability. And we will accelerate our support
to regional partners to help them build greater resilience, as the future of the Middle East will be
defined as much by climate, technological, and demographic changes as by traditional security
matters.

Build 21st Century U.S.-Africa Partnerships

Africa’s governments, institutions, and people are a major geopolitical force, one that will play a
crucial role in solving global challenges in the coming decade. Africa is more youthful, mobile,
educated, and connected than ever before. African countries comprise one of the largest regional
voting groups at the UN and their citizens lead major international institutions. The continent’s
booming population, vital natural resources, and vibrant entrepreneurship, coupled with the
African Continental Free Trade Area, have the potential to drive transformative economic
growth. Our partnerships with African states over the past three decades helped lay the
groundwork for this growth. To accelerate it, U.S.-Africa partnerships must adapt to reflect the
important geopolitical role that African nations play globally.

Advancing America’s national interests will hinge in part on working more closely, not only
with African nations, but also with regional bodies, such as the African Union, subnational
governments, civil society, and private sector and diaspora communities. We will continue to
invest in the region’s largest states, such as Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, while also
deepening our ties to medium and small states. We will engage African countries as equal
partners to achieve our shared priorities from health and pandemic preparedness to climate
change. We will also press partners about human rights, corruption, or authoritarian behavior,
and deepen partnerships with countries that make progress toward more open and democratic
governance. In coordination with international partners and regional bodies, we will counter
democratic backsliding by imposing costs for coups and pressing for progress on civilian
transitions. And we will listen to African leaders and people as they articulate their vision for

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 43

KaKKKKK

their foreign partnerships, including expectations for transparency, accountability, fairness,
inclusion, and equity.

Enhancing Africa’s peace and prosperity will bolster Africa’s ability to solve regional and global
problems. The region’s commitment and capacity to renew democracy, as well as anticipate,
prevent, and address emerging and long running conflicts can lead to favorable outcomes for
Africans and Americans. We will support African-led efforts to work toward political solutions
to costly conflicts, increasing terrorist activity, and humanitarian crises, such as those in
Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia, and
the Sahel, and invest in local and international peacebuilding and peacekeeping to prevent new
conflicts from emerging. Consistent with our broader counterterrorism approach, we will disrupt
and degrade terrorist threats against the United States while supporting partners to prevent
terrorist expansion. We will work with our African and international partners to tackle the root
causes of terrorism, including by countering corruption, strengthening accountability and justice,
investing in inclusive economic development, and advancing human rights, including women’s
rights, and also push back on the destabilizing impact of the Russia-backed Wagner Group.

We will support accelerating growth through private sector investment, help Africa unlock its
digital economy, double down on tackling food insecurity, and expand clean energy
infrastructure through the Prosper Africa, Feed the Future, and Power Africa initiatives. We will
support climate adaptation, conservation, and a just energy transition, as sub-Saharan African
countries are already experiencing severe climate impacts, compounding land use, migration
challenges, and rising food and commodity prices, made worse by Russia’s further invasion of
Ukraine. Quality healthcare systems are essential to economic growth, and we will build on our
decades-long partnerships to invest in health security and health systems infrastructure, and the
ongoing COVID-19 response. We will also work with African governments to create the
business environments and make the investments in human capital and capacity development to
attract investors, grow businesses, and create good jobs across sectors—and to bolster
U.S.-Africa trade and create new opportunities for U.S. businesses. We will seek to offer
opportunities that reflect America’s competitive advantages, promoting inclusive growth,
respecting workers’ rights, and protecting the region’s resources for future generations.

Maintain a Peaceful Arctic

The United States seeks an Arctic region that is peaceful, stable, prosperous, and cooperative.
Climate change is making the Arctic more accessible than ever, threatening Arctic communities
and vital ecosystems, creating new potential economic opportunities. and intensifying
competition to shape the region’s future. Russia has invested significantly in its presence in the
Arctic over the last decade, modernizing its military infrastructure and increasing the pace of
exercises and training operations. Its aggressive behavior has raised geopolitical tensions in the
Arctic, creating new risks of unintended conflict and hindering cooperation. The PRC has also
sought to increase its influence in the Arctic by rapidly increased its Arctic investments, pursuing
new scientific activities, and using these scientific engagements to conduct dual-use research
with intelligence or military applications.

We will uphold U.S. security in the region by improving our maritime domain awareness,
communications, disaster response capabilities, and icebreaking capacity to prepare for increased
international activity in the region. We will exercise U.S. Government presence in the region as

44 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

KaKKKKK

required, while reducing risk and preventing unnecessary escalation. Arctic nations have the
primary responsibility for addressing regional challenges, and we will deepen our cooperation
with our Arctic allies and partners and work with them to sustain the Arctic Council and other
Arctic institutions despite the challenges to Arctic cooperation posed by Russia’s war in Ukraine.
We will continue to protect freedom of navigation and determine the U.S. extended continental
shelf in accordance with international rules. We must build resilience to and mitigate climate
change in the region, including through agreements to reduce emissions and more cross-Arctic
research collaboration. As economic activity in the Arctic increases, we will invest in
infrastructure, improve livelihoods, and encourage responsible private sector investment by the
United States, our allies, and our partners, including in critical minerals, and improve investment
screening for national security purposes. Across these efforts, we will uphold our commitment to
honor Tribal sovereignty and self-governance through regular, meaningful, and robust
consultation and collaboration with Alaska Native communities.

Protect Sea, Air, and Space

People around the world depend on the sea, air, and space for their security and prosperity.

The world’s interconnected oceans, lands, waterways, and other ecosystems generate economic
opportunity and enable critical commercial and military activity. They contain biodiversity vital
to food security, clean air and water, a stable climate, and health and wellbeing. Threats to these
systems—including excessive maritime and airspace claims, pollution and unregulated
deforestation, and wildlife trafficking and illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing—impact
governments’ abilities to meet basic human needs and contribute to political, economic, and
social instability. We will stand up for freedom of navigation and overflight, support
environmental protection, and oppose destructive distant water fishing practices by upholding
international laws and norms, including the customary international law rules in the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea. And we will promote Antarctica’s status as a continent
reserved for peace and science in accordance with the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959.

Space exploration and use benefits humanity, from creating economic opportunities to
developing new technologies and enabling climate surveillance. America will maintain our
position as the world’s leader in space and work alongside the international community to ensure
the domain’s sustainability, safety, stability, and security. We must lead in updating outer space
governance, establishing a space traffic coordination system and charting a path for future space
norms and arms control. Working with allies and partners, we will develop policies and
regulations that enable the burgeoning U.S. commercial space sector to compete internationally.
We will enhance the resilience of U.S. space systems that we rely on for critical national and
homeland security functions. These efforts aim to protect U.S. interests in space, avoid
destabilizing arms races, and responsibly steward the space environment.

Sharpen Our Tools of Statecraft

Our national security institutions and workforce underpin America’s global leadership and the
security, prosperity, and freedoms of the American people. To achieve our ambitious aims, we
must modernize and adapt our tools of statecraft for today’s challenges. For example, we are:

Strengthening American diplomacy by modernizing the Department of State, including
through the recent creation of a new bureau for cyberspace and digital policy and special
envoy for critical and emerging technologies.

Adapting the Intelligence Community (IC), including by aligning our organizations to
better address competition, embracing new data tools, and enhancing integration of open
source material.

Enhancing U.S. and global early warning and forecasting for infectious disease threats
and pandemics by increasing support for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention’s (CDC) Center for Outbreak, Forecasting, and Analytics and foreign
assistance for global health security.

Reorganizing the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy to sharpen its focus
on emerging technologies and elevate senior leader attention to critical regions.
Bolstering the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Cybersecurity Service by
reimagining how DHS hires, develops, and retains top-tier and diverse cyber talent.
Making development assistance more accessible and equitable by increasing engagement
with and shifting 25 percent of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)
funding to local partners, and double USAID’s work on empowering women and girls.
Expanding our engagement with stakeholders and build our capacity to partner with the
private sector, philanthropy, diaspora communities, and civil society.

Prioritizing technology’s role in national security by elevating the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy to a cabinet-level agency and full member of the National
Security Council.

The success of these efforts and our foreign policy will require strengthening the national
security workforce by recruiting and retaining diverse, high-caliber talent. We are:

Prioritizing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility to ensure national security
institutions reflect the American public they represent.

Creating more effective and efficient hiring, recruitment, retention, and talent
development practices, particularly in STEM fields, economics, critical languages, and
regional affairs.

Supporting professional development opportunities—for both leadership and technical
skills—at all levels of the workforce.

Opening opportunities for the national security workforce to move among institutions,
both within and outside government, and carry the skills they develop back to their home
agencies.

Equipping the workforce with cutting-edge technology and better integrate data and
analytic tools to support decision-making.

Prioritizing human resources capabilities and personnel, who will drive and steward all of
these initiatives.

PART V: CONCLUSION

We are confident that the United States, alongside our allies and partners, is positioned to
succeed in our pursuit of a free, open, prosperous, and secure global order. With the key
elements outlined in this strategy, we will tackle the twin challenges of our time: out-competing
our rivals to shape the international order while tackling shared challenges, including climate
change, pandemic preparedness, and food security, that will define the next stage of human
history. We will strengthen democracy across the world, and multilateral institutions, as we look
to the future to chart new and fair rules of the road for emerging technology, cybersecurity, and
trade and economics. And we will do all this and more by leveraging our considerable
advantages and our unparalleled coalition of allies and partners.

As we implement this strategy, we will continually assess and reassess our approach to ensure
we are best serving the American people. We will be guided by the indisputable fact that the
strength and quality of the American project at home is inextricably linked with our leadership in
the world and our ability to shape the terms of the world order. This National Security Strategy
will be evaluated by an overriding metric: whether it makes life better, safer, and fairer for the
people of the United States, and whether it lifts up the countries and people around the world
who share our vision for the future.

We are motivated by a clear vision of what success looks like at the end of this decisive decade.

By enhancing our industrial capacity, investing in our people, and strengthening our democracy,
we will have strengthened the foundation of our economy, bolstered our national resilience,
enhanced our credibility on the world stage, and ensured our competitive advantages.

By deepening and expanding our diplomatic relationships not only with our democratic allies but
with all states who share our vision for a better future, we will have developed terms of
competition with our strategic rivals that are favorable to our interests and values and laid the
foundation to increase cooperation on shared challenges.

By modernizing our military, pursuing advanced technologies, and investing in our defense
workforce, we will have strengthened deterrence in an era of increasing geopolitical
confrontation, and positioned America to defend our homeland, our allies, partners, and interests
overseas, and our values across the globe.

By leveraging our national strengths and rallying a broad coalition of allies and partners, we will
advance our vision of a free, open, prosperous, and secure world, outmaneuvering our
competitors, and making meaningful progress on issues like climate change, global health, and
food security to improve the lives not just of Americans but of people around the world.

This is what we must achieve in this decisive decade. As we have done throughout our history,
America will seize this moment and rise to the challenge. There is no time to waste.

Time and again in our Nation’s history, Americans have risen to meet — and to shape —

change. The success of free nations, open markets, and social progress in recent decades has
accelerated globalization on an unprecedented scale. This has opened the doors of opportunity
around the globe, extended democracy to hundreds of millions of people, and made peace
possible among the major powers. Yet globalization has also intensified the dangers we face —
from international terrorism and the spread of deadly technologies, to economic upheaval and a
changing climate.

For nearly a decade, our Nation has been at war with a far-reaching network of violence and
hatred. Even as we end one war in Iraq, our military has been called upon to renew our focus on
Afghanistan as part of a commitment to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qa’ida and its affiliates.
This is part of a broad, multinational effort that is right and just, and we will be unwavering in
our commitment to the security of our people, allies, and partners. Moreover, as we face
multiple threats — from nations, nonstate actors, and failed states — we will maintain the
military superiority that has secured our country, and underpinned global security, for decades.

Yet as we fight the wars in front of us, we must see the horizon beyond them — a world in which
America is stronger, more secure, and is able to overcome our challenges while appealing to the
aspirations of people around the world. To get there, we must pursue a strategy of national
renewal and global leadership — a strategy that rebuilds the foundation of American strength
and influence.

Our strategy starts by recognizing that our strength and influence abroad begins with the steps
we take at home. We must grow our economy and reduce our deficit. We must educate our
children to compete in an age where knowledge is capital, and the marketplace is global. We
must develop the clean energy that can power new industry, unbind us from foreign oil, and
preserve our planet. We must pursue science and research that enables discovery, and unlocks
wonders as unforeseen to us today as the surface of the moon and the microchip were a century
ago. Simply put, we must see American innovation as a foundation of American power.

We must also build and integrate the capabilities that can advance our interests, and the interests
we share with other countries and peoples. Our Armed Forces will always be a cornerstone of
our security, but they must be complemented. Our security also depends upon diplomats who
can act in every comer of the world, from grand capitals to dangerous outposts; development

experts who can strengthen governance and support human dignity; and intelligence and law
enforcement that can unravel plots, strengthen justice systems, and work seamlessly with other
countries.

The burdens of a young century cannot fall on American shoulders alone — indeed, our
adversaries would like to see America sap our strength by overextending our power. In the past,
we have had the foresight to act judiciously and to avoid acting alone. We were part of the most
powerful wartime coalition in human history through World War II, and stitched together a
community of free nations and institutions to endure a Cold War. We are clear-eyed about the
challenge of mobilizing collective action, and the shortfalls of our international system. But
America has not succeeded by stepping outside the currents of international cooperation. We
have succeeded by steering those currents in the direction of liberty and justice — so that nations
thrive by meeting their responsibilities and face consequences when they don’t.

To do so, we will be steadfast in strengthening those old alliances that have served us so well,
while modernizing them to meet the challenges of a new century. As influence extends to more
countries and capitals, we will build new and deeper partnerships in every region, and strengthen
international standards and institutions. This engagement is no end in itself. The international
order we seek is one that can resolve the challenges of our times — countering violent extremism
and insurgency; stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and securing nuclear materials;
combating a changing climate and sustaining global growth; helping countries feed themselves
and care for their sick; resolving and preventing conflict, while also healing its wounds.

In all that we do, we will advocate for and advance the basic rights upon which our Nation was
founded, and which peoples of every race and region have made their own. We promote these
values by living them, including our commitment to the rule of law. We will strengthen
international norms that protect these rights, and create space and support for those who resist
repression. Our commitment to human dignity includes support for development, which is

why we will fight poverty and corruption. And we reject the notion that lasting security and
prosperity can be found by turning away from universal rights — democracy does not merely
represent our better angels, it stands in opposition to aggression and injustice, and our support for
universal rights is both fundamental to American leadership and a source of our strength in the
world.

As a Nation made up of people from every race, region, faith, and culture, America will persist
in promoting peace among different peoples and believes that democracy and individual
empowerment need not come at the expense of cherished identities. Indeed, no nation should be
better positioned to lead in an era of globalization than America — the Nation that helped bring
globalization about, whose institutions are designed to prepare individuals to succeed in a
competitive world, and whose people trace their roots to every country on the face of the Earth.

As a citizen, Senator, and President, I have always believed that America’s greatest asset is its
people — from the awe I felt as a child watching a space capsule pulled out of the Pacific, to the
strength I drew from workers rebuilding their lives in Illinois, to the respect that I have for the
generation of Americans who serve our country today. That is why I also believe that we must
foster even deeper connections among Americans and peoples around the globe. Our long-term

security will come not from our ability to instill fear in other peoples, but through our capacity to
speak to their hopes. And that work will best be done through the power of the decency and
dignity of the American people — our troops and diplomats, but also our private sector,
nongovernmental organizations, and citizens. All of us have a role to play.

From the birth of our liberty, America has had a faith in the future — a belief that where we’re
going is better than where we’ve been, even when the path ahead is uncertain. To fulfill that
promise, generations of Americans have built upon the foundation of our forefathers — finding
opportunity, fighting injustice, and forging a more perfect Union. We have also created webs of
commerce, supported an international architecture of laws and institutions, and spilled American
blood in foreign lands — not to build an empire, but to shape a world in which more individuals
and nations could determine their own destiny, and live with the peace and dignity that they
deserve.

In 2010, America is hardened by wars, and inspired by the servicemen and women who fight
them. We are disciplined by a devastating economic crisis, and determined to see that its legacy
is a new foundation for prosperity; and we are bound by a creed that has guided us at home, and
served as a beacon to the world. America’s greatness is not assured — each generation’s place
in history is a question unanswered. But even as we are tested by new challenges, the question
of our future is not one that will be answered for us, it is one that will be answered by us. And
in a young century whose trajectory is uncertain, America is ready to lead once more.

I. Overview of National Security Strategy

At the dawn of the 21st century, the United States of America faces a broad and complex array of chal-
lenges to our national security. Just as America helped to determine the course of the 20th century,
we must now build the sources of American strength and influence, and shape an international order
capable of overcoming the challenges of the 21st century.

The World as It Is, A Strategy for the World We Seek

To succeed, we must face the world as it is. The two decades since the end of the Cold War have been
marked by both the promise and perils of change. The circle of peaceful democracies has expanded; the
specter of nuclear war has lifted; major powers are at peace; the global economy has grown; commerce
has stitched the fate of nations together; and more individuals can determine their own destiny. Yet these
advances have been accompanied by persistent problems. Wars over ideology have given way to wars
over religious, ethnic, and tribal identity; nuclear dangers have proliferated; inequality and economic
instability have intensified; damage to our environment, food insecurity, and dangers to public health
are increasingly shared; and the same tools that empower individuals to build enable them to destroy.

The dark side of this globalized world came to the forefront for the American people on September
11, 2001. The immediate threat demonstrated by the deadliest attacks ever launched upon American
soil demanded strong and durable approaches to defend our homeland. In the years since, we have
launched a war against al-Qa'ida and its affiliates, decided to fight a war in Iraq, and confronted a sweep-
ing economic crisis. More broadly, though, we have wrestled with how to advance American interests in a
world that has changed—a world in which the international architecture of the 20th century is buckling
under the weight of new threats, the global economy has accelerated the competition facing our people
and businesses, and the universal aspiration for freedom and dignity contends with new obstacles.

Our country possesses the attributes that have supported our leadership for decades—sturdy alliances,
an unmatched military, the world’s largest economy, a strong and evolving democracy, and a dynamic
citizenry. Going forward, there should be no doubt: the United States of America will continue to
underwrite global security—through our commitments to allies, partners, and institutions; our focus on
defeating al-Qa'ida and its affiliates in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and around the globe; and our determina-
tion to deter aggression and prevent the proliferation of the world’s most dangerous weapons. As we do,
we must recognize that no one nation—no matter how powerful—can meet global challenges alone.
As we did after World War II, America must prepare for the future, while forging cooperative approaches
among nations that can yield results.

Our national security strategy is, therefore, focused on renewing American leadership so that we can
more effectively advance our interests in the 21st century. We will do so by building upon the sources
of our strength at home, while shaping an international order that can meet the challenges of our
time. This strategy recognizes the fundamental connection between our national security, our national
competitiveness, resilience, and moral example. And it reaffirms America’s commitment to pursue our
interests through an international system in which all nations have certain rights and responsibilities.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

This will allow America to leverage our engagement abroad on behalf of a world in which individuals
enjoy more freedom and opportunity, and nations have incentives to act responsibly, while facing
consequences when they do not.

Renewing American Leadership—Building at Home, Shaping Abroad

Our approach begins with a commitment to build a stronger foundation for American leadership,
because what takes place within our borders will determine our strength and influence beyond them.
This truth is only heightened in a world of greater interconnection—a world in which our prosperity is
inextricably linked to global prosperity, our security can be directly challenged by developments across
an ocean, and our actions are scrutinized as never before.

At the center of our efforts is a commitment to renew our economy, which serves as the wellspring of
American power. The American people are now emerging from the most devastating recession that we
have faced since the Great Depression. As we continue to act to ensure that our recovery is broad and
sustained, we are also laying the foundation for the long term growth of our economy and competitive-
ness of our citizens. The investments that we have made in recovery are a part of a broader effort that
will contribute to our strength: by providing a quality education for our children; enhancing science and
innovation; transforming our energy economy to power new jobs and industries; lowering the cost of
health care for our people and businesses; and reducing the Federal deficit.

Each of these steps will sustain America’s ability to lead in a world where economic power and individual
opportunity are more diffuse. These efforts are also tied to our commitment to secure a more resilient
nation. Our recovery includes rebuilding an infrastructure that will be more secure and reliable in the
face of terrorist threats and natural disasters. Our focus on education and science can ensure that the
breakthroughs of tomorrow take place in the United States. Our development of new sources of energy
will reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Our commitment to deficit reduction will discipline us to
make hard choices, and to avoid overreach. These steps complement our efforts to integrate homeland
security with national security; including seamless coordination among Federal, state, and local govern-
ments to prevent, protect against, and respond to threats and natural disasters.

Finally, the work to build a stronger foundation for our leadership within our borders recognizes that
the most effective way for the United States of America to promote our values is to live them. America’s
commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law are essential sources of our strength and
influence in the world. They too must be cultivated by our rejection of actions like torture that are not in
line with our values, by our commitment to pursue justice consistent with our Constitution, and by our
steady determination to extend the promise of America to all of our citizens. America has always been
a beacon to the peoples of the world when we ensure that the light of America’s example burns bright.

Building this stronger foundation will support America’s efforts to shape an international system that
can meet the challenges of our time. In the aftermath of World War Il, it was the United States that
helped take the lead in constructing a new international architecture to keep the peace and advance
prosperity—from NATO and the United Nations, to treaties that govern the laws and weapons of war;
from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, to an expanding web of trade agreements. This

I. OVERVIEW OF NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

architecture, despite its flaws, averted world war, enabled economic growth, and advanced human
rights, while facilitating effective burden sharing among the United States, our allies, and partners.

Today, we need to be clear-eyed about the strengths and shortcomings of international institutions that
were developed to deal with the challenges of an earlier time and the shortage of political will that has
at times stymied the enforcement of international norms. Yet it would be destructive to both American
national security and global security if the United States used the emergence of new challenges and
the shortcomings of the international system as a reason to walk away from it. Instead, we must focus
American engagement on strengthening international institutions and galvanizing the collective action
that can serve common interests such as combating violent extremism; stopping the spread of nuclear
weapons and securing nuclear materials; achieving balanced and sustainable economic growth; and
forging cooperative solutions to the threat of climate change, armed conflict, and pandemic disease.

The starting point for that collective action will be our engagement with other countries. The cornerstone
of this engagement is the relationship between the United States and our close friends and allies in
Europe, Asia, the Americas, and the Middle East—ties which are rooted in shared interests and shared
values, and which serve our mutual security and the broader security and prosperity of the world. We are
working to build deeper and more effective partnerships with other key centers of influence—includ-
ing China, India, and Russia, as well as increasingly influential nations such as Brazil, South Africa, and
Indonesia—so that we can cooperate on issues of bilateral and global concern, with the recognition
that power, in an interconnected world, is no longer a zero sum game. We are expanding our outreach
to emerging nations, particularly those that can be models of regional success and stability, from the
Americas to Africa to Southeast Asia. And we will pursue engagement with hostile nations to test their
intentions, give their governments the opportunity to change course, reach out to their people, and
mobilize international coalitions.

This engagement will underpin our commitment to an international order based upon rights and
responsibilities. International institutions must more effectively represent the world of the 21st century,
with a broader voice—and greater responsibilities—for emerging powers, and they must be modernized
to more effectively generate results on issues of global interest. Constructive national steps on issues
ranging from nuclear security to climate change must be incentivized, so nations that choose to do
their part see the benefits of responsible action. Rules of the road must be followed, and there must be
consequences for those nations that break the rules—whether they are nonproliferation obligations,
trade agreements, or human rights commitments.

This modernization of institutions, strengthening of international norms, and enforcement of inter-
national law is not a task for the United States alone—but together with like-minded nations, it is a
task we can lead. A key source of American leadership throughout our history has been enlightened
self-interest. We want a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives
will be better if other peoples’ children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity. The belief
that our own interests are bound to the interests of those beyond our borders will continue to guide
our engagement with nations and peoples.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

Advancing Top National Security Priorities

Just as our national security strategy is focused on renewing our leadership for the long term, it is also
facilitating immediate action on top priorities. This Administration has no greater responsibility than
the safety and security of the American people. And there is no greater threat to the American people
than weapons of mass destruction, particularly the danger posed by the pursuit of nuclear weapons by
violent extremists and their proliferation to additional states.

That is why we are pursuing a comprehensive nonproliferation and nuclear security agenda, grounded
in the rights and responsibilities of nations. We are reducing our nuclear arsenal and reliance on nuclear
weapons, while ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of our deterrent. We are strengthening the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as the foundation of nonproliferation, while working through
the NPT to hold nations like Iran and North Korea accountable for their failure to meet international
obligations. We are leading a global effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials from terrorists.
And we are pursuing new strategies to protect against biological attacks and challenges to the cyber
networks that we depend upon.

As we secure the world’s most dangerous weapons, we are fighting a war against a far-reaching network
of hatred and violence. We will disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qa’ida and its affiliates through a com-
prehensive strategy that denies them safe haven, strengthens front-line partners, secures our homeland,
pursues justice through durable legal approaches, and counters a bankrupt agenda of extremism and
murder with an agenda of hope and opportunity. The frontline of this fight is Afghanistan and Pakistan,
where we are applying relentless pressure on al-Qa'ida, breaking the Taliban’s momentum, and strength-
ening the security and capacity of our partners. In this effort, our troops are again demonstrating their
extraordinary service, making great sacrifices in a time of danger, and they have our full support.

In Iraq, we are transitioning to full Iraqi sovereignty and responsibility—a process that includes the
removal of our troops, the strengthening of our civilian capacity, and a long-term partnership to the
lraqi Government and people. We will be unwavering in our pursuit of a comprehensive peace between
Israel and its neighbors, including a two-state solution that ensures Israel’s security, while fulfilling the
Palestinian peoples’ legitimate aspirations for a viable state of their own. And our broader engagement
with Muslim communities around the world will spur progress on critical political and security matters,
while advancing partnerships on a broad range of issues based upon mutual interests and mutual
respect.

As we rebuild the economic strength upon which our leadership depends, we are working to advance
the balanced and sustainable growth upon which global prosperity and stability depends. This includes
steps at home and abroad to prevent another crisis. We have shifted focus to the G-20 as the premier
forum for international economic cooperation, and are working to rebalance global demand so that
America saves more and exports more, while emerging economies generate more demand. And we will
pursue bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that advance our shared prosperity, while accelerat-
ing investments in development that can narrow inequality, expand markets, and support individual
opportunity and state capacity abroad.

I. OVERVIEW OF NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

These efforts to advance security and prosperity are enhanced by our support for certain values that are
universal. Nations that respect human rights and democratic values are more successful and stronger
partners, and individuals who enjoy such respect are more able to achieve their full potential. The United
States rejects the false choice between the narrow pursuit of our interests and an endless campaign
to impose our values. Instead, we see it as fundamental to our own interests to support a just peace
around the world—one in which individuals, and not just nations, are granted the fundamental rights
that they deserve.

In keeping with the focus on the foundation of our strength and influence, we are promoting universal
values abroad by living them at home, and will not seek to impose these values through force. Instead,
we are working to strengthen international norms on behalf of human rights, while welcoming all
peaceful democratic movements. We are supporting the development of institutions within fragile
democracies, integrating human rights as a part of our dialogue with repressive governments, and sup-
porting the spread of technologies that facilitate the freedom to access information. And we recognize
economic opportunity as a human right, and are promoting the dignity of all men and women through
our support for global health, food security, and cooperatives responses to humanitarian crises.

Finally, our efforts to shape an international order that promotes a just peace must facilitate cooperation
capable of addressing the problems of our time. This international order will support our interests, but
it is also an end that we seek in its own right. New challenges hold out the prospect of opportunity, but
only if the international community breaks down the old habits of suspicion to build upon common
interests. A global effort to combat climate change must draw upon national actions to reduce emis-
sions and acommitment to mitigate their impact. Efforts to prevent conflicts and keep the peace in their
aftermath can stop insecurity from spreading. Global cooperation to prevent the spread of pandemic
disease can promote public health.

Implementing this agenda will not be easy. To succeed, we must balance and integrate all elements
of American power and update our national security capacity for the 21st century. We must maintain
our military’s conventional superiority, while enhancing its capacity to defeat asymmetric threats. Our
diplomacy and development capabilities must be modernized, and our civilian expeditionary capac-
ity strengthened, to support the full breadth of our priorities. Our intelligence and homeland security
efforts must be integrated with our national security policies, and those of our allies and partners. And
our ability to synchronize our actions while communicating effectively with foreign publics must be
enhanced to sustain global support.

However, America’s greatest asset remains our people. In an era that will be shaped by the ability to seize
the opportunities of a world that has grown more interconnected, it is the American people who will
make the difference—the troops and civilians serving within our government; businesses, foundations,
and educational institutions that operate around the globe; and citizens who possess the dynamism,
drive, and diversity to thrive in a world that has grown smaller. Because for all of its dangers, globalization
is in part a product of American leadership and the ingenuity of the American people. We are uniquely
suited to seize its promise.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

Our story is not without imperfections. Yet at each juncture that history has called upon us to rise to
the occasion, we have advanced our own security, while contributing to the cause of human progress.
To continue to do so, our national security strategy must be informed by our people, enhanced by the
contributions of the Congress, and strengthened by the unity of the American people. If we draw on
that spirit anew, we can build a world of greater peace, prosperity, and human dignity.

II. Strategic Approach

“More than at any point in human history—the interests of nations and peoples are
shared. The religious convictions that we hold in our hearts can forge new bonds among
people, or tear us apart. The technology we harness can light the path to peace, or forever
darken it. The energy we use can sustain our planet, or destroy it. What happens to the
hope of a single child—anywhere—can enrich our world, or impoverish it.”

—President Barack Obama, United Nations General Assembly, September 22, 2009

The United States must renew its leadership in the world by building and cultivating the sources of our
strength and influence. Our national security depends upon America’s ability to leverage our unique
national attributes, just as global security depends upon strong and responsible American leadership.
That includes our military might, economic competitiveness, moral leadership, global engagement,
and efforts to shape an international system that serves the mutual interests of nations and peoples.
For the world has changed at an extraordinary pace, and the United States must adapt to advance our
interests and sustain our leadership.

American interests are enduring. They are:
e The security of the United States, its citizens, and U.S. allies and partners;

e Astrong, innovative, and growing U.S. economy in an open international economic system that
promotes opportunity and prosperity;

e Respect for universal values at home and around the world; and

e Aninternational order advanced by U.S. leadership that promotes peace, security, and oppor-
tunity through stronger cooperation to meet global challenges.

Currently, the United States is focused on implementing a responsible transition as we end the war in
lraq, succeeding in Afghanistan, and defeating al-Qa’ida and its terrorist affiliates, while moving our
economy from catastrophic recession to lasting recovery. As we confront these crises, our national
strategy must take a longer view. We must build a stronger foundation for American leadership and
work to better shape the outcomes that are most fundamental to our people in the 21st century.

The Strategic Environment—The World as It Is

In the two decades since the end of the Cold War, the free flow of information, people, goods and services
has accelerated at an unprecedented rate. This interconnection has empowered individuals for good
and ill, and challenged state based international institutions that were largely designed in the wake of
World War II by policymakers who had different challenges in mind. Nonstate actors can have a dramatic
influence on the world around them. Economic growth has alleviated poverty and led to new centers of
influence. More nations are asserting themselves regionally and globally. The lives of our citizens—their
safety and prosperity—are more bound than ever to events beyond our borders.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

Within this environment, the attacks of September 11, 2001, were a transformative event for the United
States, demonstrating just how much trends far beyond our shores could directly endanger the personal
safety of the American people. The attacks put into sharp focus America’s position as the sole global
superpower, the dangers of violent extremism, and the simmering conflicts that followed the peaceful
conclusion of the Cold War. And they drew a swift and forceful response from the United States and
our allies and partners in Afghanistan. This response was followed by our decision to go to war in Iraq,
and the ensuing years have seen America’s forces, resources, and national security strategy focused on
these conflicts.

The United States is now fighting two wars with many thousands of our men and women deployed in
harm's way, and hundreds of billions of dollars dedicated to funding these conflicts. In Iraq, we are sup-
porting a transition of responsibility to the sovereign Iraqi Government. We are supporting the security
and prosperity of our partners in Afghanistan and Pakistan as part of a broader campaign to disrupt,
dismantle, and defeat al-Qa’ida and its violent extremist affiliates.

Yet these wars—and our global efforts to successfully counter violent extremism—are only one ele-
ment of our strategic environment and cannot define America’s engagement with the world. Terrorism
is one of many threats that are more consequential in a global age. The gravest danger to the American
people and global security continues to come from weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear
weapons. The space and cyberspace capabilities that power our daily lives and military operations are
vulnerable to disruption and attack. Dependence upon fossil fuels constrains our options and pollutes
our environment. Climate change and pandemic disease threaten the security of regions and the health
and safety of the American people. Failing states breed conflict and endanger regional and global
security. Global criminal networks foment insecurity abroad and bring people and goods across our
own borders that threaten our people.

The global economy is being reshaped by innovation, emerging economies, transition to low-carbon
energy, and recovery from a catastrophic recession. The convergence of wealth and living standards
among developed and emerging economies holds out the promise of more balanced global growth, but
dramatic inequality persists within and among nations. Profound cultural and demographic tensions,
rising demand for resources, and rapid urbanization could reshape single countries and entire regions.
As the world grows more interconnected, more individuals are gaining awareness of their universal
rights and have the capacity to pursue them. Democracies that respect the rights of their people remain
successful states and America’s most steadfast allies. Yet the advance of democracy and human rights
has stalled in many parts of the world.

More actors exert power and influence. Europe is now more united, free, and at peace than ever before.
The European Union has deepened its integration. Russia has reemerged in the international arena as a
strong voice. China and India—the world’s two most populous nations—are becoming more engaged
globally. From Latin America to Africa to the Pacific, new and emerging powers hold out opportunities
for partnership, even as a handful of states endanger regional and global security by flouting interna-
tional norms. International institutions play a critical role in facilitating cooperation, but at times cannot
effectively address new threats or seize new opportunities. Meanwhile, individuals, corporations, and
civil society play an increasingly important role in shaping events around the world.

Il. STRATEGIC APPROACH

The United States retains the strengths that have enabled our leadership for many decades. Our society
is exceptional in its openness, vast diversity, resilience, and engaged citizenry. Our private sector and
civil society exhibit enormous ingenuity and innovation, and our workers are capable and dedicated.
We have the world’s largest economy and most powerful military, strong alliances and a vibrant cultural
appeal, and a history of leadership in economic and social development. We continue to be a destination
that is sought out by immigrants from around the world, who enrich our society. We have a transparent,
accountable democracy and a dynamic and productive populace with deep connections to peoples
around the world. And we continue to embrace a set of values that have enabled liberty and opportunity
at home and abroad.

Now, the very fluidity within the international system that breeds new challenges must be approached
as an opportunity to forge new international cooperation. We must rebalance our long-term priorities so
that we successfully move beyond today’s wars, and focus our attention and resources on a broader set
of countries and challenges. We must seize on the opportunities afforded by the world’s interconnection,
while responding effectively and comprehensively to its dangers. And we must take advantage of the
unparalleled connections that America’s Government, private sector, and citizens have around the globe.

The Strategic Approach—The World We Seek

In the past, the United States has thrived when both our nation and our national security policy have
adapted to shape change instead of being shaped by it. For instance, as the industrial revolution took
hold, America transformed our economy and our role in the world. When the world was confronted by
fascism, America prepared itself to win a war and to shape the peace that followed. When the United
States encountered an ideological, economic, and military threat from communism, we shaped our
practices and institutions at home—and policies abroad—to meet this challenge. Now, we must once
again position the United States to champion mutual interests among nations and peoples.

Building Our Foundation

Our national security begins at home. What takes place within our borders has always been the source
of our strength, and this is even truer in an age of interconnection.

First and foremost, we must renew the foundation of America’s strength. In the long run, the welfare
of the American people will determine America’s strength in the world, particularly at a time when our
own economy is inextricably linked to the global economy. Our prosperity serves as a wellspring for
our power. It pays for our military, underwrites our diplomacy and development efforts, and serves as
a leading source of our influence in the world. Moreover, our trade and investment supports millions
of American jobs, forges links among countries, spurs global development, and contributes to a stable
and peaceful political and economic environment.

Yet even as we have maintained our military advantage, our competitiveness has been set back in recent
years. We are recovering from underinvestment in the areas that are central to America’s strength. We
have not adequately advanced priorities like education, energy, science and technology, and health
care—all of which are essential to U.S. competitiveness, long-term prosperity, and strength. Years of
rising fiscal and trade deficits will also necessitate hard choices in the years ahead.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

That is why we are rebuilding our economy so that it will serve as an engine of opportunity for the
American people, and a source of American influence abroad. The United States must ensure that we
have the world’s best-educated workforce, a private sector that fosters innovation, and citizens and busi-
nesses that can access affordable health care to compete in a globalized economy. We must transform
the way that we use energy—diversifying supplies, investing in innovation, and deploying clean energy
technologies. By doing so, we will enhance energy security, create jobs, and fight climate change.

Rebuilding our economy must include putting ourselves on a fiscally sustainable path. As such, imple-
menting our national security strategy will require a disciplined approach to setting priorities and mak-
ing tradeoffs among competing programs and activities. Taken together, these efforts will position our
nation for success in the global marketplace, while also supporting our national security capacity—the
strength of our military, intelligence, diplomacy and development, and the security and resilience of
our homeland.

We are now moving beyond traditional distinctions between homeland and national security. National
security draws on the strength and resilience of our citizens, communities, and economy. This includes a
determination to prevent terrorist attacks against the American people by fully coordinating the actions
that we take abroad with the actions and precautions that we take at home. It must also include a com-
mitment to building a more secure and resilient nation, while maintaining open flows of goods and
people. We will continue to develop the capacity to address the threats and hazards that confront us,
while redeveloping our infrastructure to secure our people and work cooperatively with other nations.

America’s example is also a critical component of our foundation. The human rights which America has
stood for since our founding have enabled our leadership, provided a source of inspiration for peoples
around the world, and drawn a clear contrast between the United States and our democratic allies, and
those nations and individuals that deny or suppress human rights. Our efforts to live our own values,
and uphold the principles of democracy in our own society, underpin our support for the aspirations of
the oppressed abroad, who know they can turn to America for leadership based on justice and hope.

Our moral leadership is grounded principally in the power of our example—not through an effort to
impose our system on other peoples. Yet over the years, some methods employed in pursuit of our
security have compromised our fidelity to the values that we promote, and our leadership on their
behalf. This undercuts our ability to support democratic movements abroad, challenge nations that
violate international human rights norms, and apply our broader leadership for good in the world.
That is why we will lead on behalf of our values by living them. Our struggle to stay true to our values
and Constitution has always been a lodestar, both to the American people and to those who share our
aspiration for human dignity.

Our values have allowed us to draw the best and brightest to our shores, to inspire those who share our
cause abroad, and to give us the credibility to stand up to tyranny. America must demonstrate through
words and deeds the resilience of our values and Constitution. For if we compromise our values in pur-
suit of security, we will undermine both; if we fortify them, we will sustain a key source of our strength
and leadership in the world—one that sets us apart from our enemies and our potential competitors.

Il. STRATEGIC APPROACH

Pursuing Comprehensive Engagement

Our foundation will support our efforts to engage nations, institutions, and peoples around the world
on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect.

Engagement is the active participation of the United States in relationships beyond our borders. It is,
quite simply, the opposite of a self-imposed isolation that denies us the ability to shape outcomes.
Indeed, America has never succeeded through isolationism. As the nation that helped to build our
international system after World War Il and to bring about the globalization that came with the end of
the Cold War, we must reengage the world on a comprehensive and sustained basis.

Engagement begins with our closest friends and allies—from Europe to Asia; from North America to
the Middle East. These nations share a common history of struggle on behalf of security, prosperity, and
democracy. They share common values and a common commitment to international norms that recog-
nize both the rights and responsibilities of all sovereign nations. America’s national security depends on
these vibrant alliances, and we must engage them as active partners in addressing global and regional
security priorities and harnessing new opportunities to advance common interests. For instance, we
pursue close and regular collaboration with our close allies the United Kingdom, France, and Germany
on issues of mutual and global concern.

We will continue to deepen our cooperation with other 21st century centers of influence—including
China, India, and Russia—on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect. We will also pursue
diplomacy and development that supports the emergence of new and successful partners, from the
Americas to Africa; from the Middle East to Southeast Asia. Our ability to advance constructive coopera-
tion is essential to the security and prosperity of specific regions, and to facilitating global cooperation on
issues ranging from violent extremism and nuclear proliferation, to climate change, and global economic
instability—issues that challenge all nations, but that no one nation alone can meet.

To adversarial governments, we offer a clear choice: abide by international norms, and achieve the
political and economic benefits that come with greater integration with the international community;
or refuse to accept this pathway, and bear the consequences of that decision, including greater isolation.
Through engagement, we can create opportunities to resolve differences, strengthen the international
community's support for our actions, learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes, and plainly
demonstrate to the publics within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation.

Successful engagement will depend upon the effective use and integration of different elements of
American power. Our diplomacy and development capabilities must help prevent conflict, spur eco-
nomic growth, strengthen weak and failing states, lift people out of poverty, combat climate change
and epidemic disease, and strengthen institutions of democratic governance. Our military will continue
strengthening its capacity to partner with foreign counterparts, train and assist security forces, and
pursue military-to-military ties with a broad range of governments. We will continue to foster economic
and financial transactions to advance our shared prosperity. And our intelligence and law enforcement
agencies must cooperate effectively with foreign governments to anticipate events, respond to crises,
and provide safety and security.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

Finally, we will pursue engagement among peoples—not just governments—around the world. The
United States Government will make a sustained effort to engage civil society and citizens and facilitate
increased connections among the American people and peoples around the world—through efforts
ranging from public service and educational exchanges, to increased commerce and private sector
partnerships. In many instances, these modes of engagement have a powerful and enduring impact
beyond our borders, and are a cost-effective way of projecting a positive vision of American leadership.
Time and again, we have seen that the best ambassadors for American values and interests are the
American people—our businesses, nongovernmental organizations, scientists, athletes, artists, military
service members, and students.

Facilitating increased international engagement outside of government will help prepare our country
to thrive in a global economy, while building the goodwill and relationships that are invaluable to sus-
taining American leadership. It also helps leverage strengths that are unique to America—our diversity
and diaspora populations, our openness and creativity, and the values that our people embody in their
own lives.

Promoting a Just and Sustainable International Order

Our engagement will underpin a just and sustainable international order—just, because it advances
mutual interests, protects the rights of all, and holds accountable those who refuse to meet their
responsibilities; sustainable because it is based on broadly shared norms and fosters collective action
to address common challenges.

This engagement will pursue an international order that recognizes the rights and responsibilities of all
nations. As we did after World War Il, we must pursue a rules-based international system that can advance
our own interests by serving mutual interests. International institutions must be more effective and
representative of the diffusion of influence in the 21st century. Nations must have incentives to behave
responsibly, or be isolated when they do not. The test of this international order must be the cooperation
it facilitates and the results it generates—the ability of nations to come together to confront common
challenges like violent extremism, nuclear proliferation, climate change, and a changing global economy.

That is precisely the reason we should strengthen enforcement of international law and our commit-
ment to engage and modernize international institutions and frameworks. Those nations that refuse
to meet their responsibilities will forsake the opportunities that come with international cooperation.
Credible and effective alternatives to military action—from sanctions to isolation—must be strong
enough to change behavior, just as we must reinforce our alliances and our military capabilities. And if
nations challenge or undermine an international order that is based upon rights and responsibilities,
they must find themselves isolated.

We succeeded in the post-World War Il era by pursuing our interests within multilateral forums like the
United Nations—not outside of them. We recognized that institutions that aggregated the national inter-
ests of many nations would never be perfect; but we also saw that they were an indispensable vehicle
for pooling international resources and enforcing international norms. Indeed, the basis for international

III. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS

cooperation since World War II has been an architecture of international institutions, organizations,
regimes, and standards that establishes certain rights and responsibilities for all sovereign nations.

In recent years America’s frustration with international institutions has led us at times to engage the
United Nations (U.N.) system on an ad hoc basis. But in a world of transnational challenges, the United
States will need to invest in strengthening the international system, working from inside interna-
tional institutions and frameworks to face their imperfections head on and to mobilize transnational
cooperation.

We must be clear-eyed about the factors that have impeded effectiveness in the past. In order for collec-
tive action to be mobilized, the polarization that persists across region, race, and religion will need to be
replaced by a galvanizing sense of shared interest. Swift and effective international action often turns on
the political will of coalitions of countries that comprise regional or international institutions. New and
emerging powers who seek greater voice and representation will need to accept greater responsibility
for meeting global challenges. When nations breach agreed international norms, the countries who
espouse those norms must be convinced to band together to enforce them.

We will expand our support to modernizing institutions and arrangements such as the evolution of the
G-8 to the G-20 to reflect the realities of today’s international environment. Working with the institutions
and the countries that comprise them, we will enhance international capacity to prevent conflict, spur
economic growth, improve security, combat climate change, and address the challenges posed by weak
and failing states. And we will challenge and assist international institutions and frameworks to reform
when they fail to live up to their promise. Strengthening the legitimacy and authority of international
law and institutions, especially the U.N., will require a constant struggle to improve performance.

Furthermore, our international order must recognize the increasing influence of individuals in today’s
world. There must be opportunities for civil society to thrive within nations and to forge connections
among them. And there must be opportunities for individuals and the private sector to play a major role
in addressing common challenges—whether supporting a nuclear fuel bank, promoting global health,
fostering entrepreneurship, or exposing violations of universal rights. In the 21st century, the ability of
individuals and nongovernment actors to play a positive role in shaping the international environment
represents a distinct opportunity for the United States.

Within this context, we know that an international order where every nation upholds its rights and
responsibilities will remain elusive. Force will sometimes be necessary to confront threats. Technology
will continue to bring with it new dangers. Poverty and disease will not be completely abolished.
Oppression will always be with us. But if we recognize these challenges, embrace America’s responsibil-
ity to confront them with its partners, and forge new cooperative approaches to get others to join us
in overcoming them, then the international order of a globalized age can better advance our interests
and the common interests of nations and peoples everywhere.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

 

Strengthening National Capacity—A Whole of Government Approach

To succeed, we must update, balance, and integrate all of the tools of American power and work with our
allies and partners to do the same. Our military must maintain its conventional superiority and, as long as
nuclear weapons exist, our nuclear deterrent capability, while continuing to enhance its capacity to defeat
asymmetric threats, preserve access to the global commons, and strengthen partners. We must invest

in diplomacy and development capabilities and institutions in a way that complements and reinforces
our global partners. Our intelligence capabilities must continuously evolve to identify and characterize
conventional and asymmetric threats and provide timely insight. And we must integrate our approach to
homeland security with our broader national security approach.

We are improving the integration of skills and capabilities within our military and civilian institutions, so
they complement each other and operate seamlessly. We are also improving coordinated planning and
policymaking and must build our capacity in key areas where we fall short. This requires close coopera-
tion with Congress and a deliberate and inclusive interagency process, so that we achieve integration of
our efforts to implement and monitor operations, policies, and strategies. To initiate this effort, the White
House merged the staffs of the National Security Council and Homeland Security Council.

However, work remains to foster coordination across departments and agencies. Key steps include more
effectively ensuring alignment of resources with our national security strategy, adapting the education and
training of national security professionals to equip them to meet modern challenges, reviewing authorities
and mechanisms to implement and coordinate assistance programs, and other policies and programs that
strengthen coordination.

- Defense: We are strengthening our military to ensure that it can prevail in today’s wars; to prevent and
deter threats against the United States, its interests, and our allies and partners; and prepare to defend
the United States in a wide range of contingencies against state and nonstate actors. We will continue to
rebalance our military capabilities to excel at counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, stability operations,
and meeting increasingly sophisticated security threats, while ensuring our force is ready to address
the full range of military operations. This includes preparing for increasingly sophisticated adversaries,
deterring and defeating aggression in anti-access environments, and defending the United States and
supporting civil authorities at home. The most valuable component of our national defense is the men
and women who make up America’s all-volunteer force. They have shown tremendous resilience, adapt-
ability, and capacity for innovation, and we will provide our service members with the resources that
they need to succeed and rededicate ourselves to providing support and care for wounded warriors,
veterans, and military families. We must set the force on a path to sustainable deployment cycles and
preserve and enhance the long-term viability of our force through successful recruitment, retention,
and recognition of those who serve.

+ Diplomacy: Diplomacy is as fundamental to our national security as our defense capability. Our diplo-
mats are the first line of engagement, listening to our partners, learning from them, building respect for
one another, and seeking common ground. Diplomats, development experts, and others in the United
States Government must be able to work side by side to support a common agenda. New skills are
needed to foster effective interaction to convene, connect, and mobilize not only other governments
and international organizations, but also nonstate actors such as corporations, foundations, nongovern-
mental organizations, universities, think tanks, and faith-based organizations, all of whom increasingly
have a distinct role to play on both diplomatic and development issues. To accomplish these goals our

 

 

TABLE OF CONTENTS

 

 

diplomatic personnel and missions must be expanded at home and abroad to support the increasingly
transnational nature of 21st century security challenges. And we must provide the appropriate authori-
ties and mechanisms to implement and coordinate assistance programs and grow the civilian expedi-
tionary capacity required to assist governments on a diverse array of issues.

Economic: Our economic institutions are crucial components of our national capacity and our economic
instruments are the bedrock of sustainable national growth, prosperity and influence. The Office of
Management and Budget, Departments of the Treasury, State, Commerce, Energy, and Agriculture,
United States Trade Representative, Federal Reserve Board, and other institutions help manage our
currency, trade, foreign investment, deficit, inflation, productivity, and national competitiveness.
Remaining a vibrant 21st century economic power also requires close cooperation between and
among developed nations and emerging markets because of the interdependent nature of the global
economy. America—like other nations—is dependent upon overseas markets to sell its exports and
maintain access to scarce commodities and resources. Thus, finding overlapping mutual economic
interests with other nations and maintaining those economic relationships are key elements of our
national security strategy.

Development: Development is a strategic, economic, and moral imperative. We are focusing on assist-
ing developing countries and their people to manage security threats, reap the benefits of global
economic expansion, and set in place accountable and democratic institutions that serve basic human
needs. Through an aggressive and affirmative development agenda and commensurate resources,

we can strengthen the regional partners we need to help us stop conflicts and counter global criminal
networks; build a stable, inclusive global economy with new sources of prosperity; advance democracy
and human rights; and ultimately position ourselves to better address key global challenges by growing
the ranks of prosperous, capable, and democratic states that can be our partners in the decades ahead.
To do this, we are expanding our civilian development capability; engaging with international financial
institutions that leverage our resources and advance our objectives; pursuing a development budget
that more deliberately reflects our policies and our strategy, not sector earmarks; and ensuring that our
policy instruments are aligned in support of development objectives.

Homeland Security: Homeland security traces its roots to traditional and historic functions of govern-
ment and society, such as civil defense, emergency response, law enforcement, customs, border patrol,
and immigration. In the aftermath of 9/11 and the foundation of the Department of Homeland Security,
these functions have taken on new organization and urgency. Homeland security, therefore, strives to
adapt these traditional functions to confront new threats and evolving hazards. It is not simply about
government action alone, but rather about the collective strength of the entire country. Our approach
relies on our shared efforts to identify and interdict threats; deny hostile actors the ability to operate
within our borders; maintain effective control of our physical borders; safeguard lawful trade and travel
into and out of the United States; disrupt and dismantle transnational terrorist, and criminal organiza-
tions; and ensure our national resilience in the face of the threat and hazards. Taken together, these
efforts must support a homeland that is safe and secure from terrorism and other hazards and in which
American interests, aspirations, and way of life can thrive.

Intelligence: Our country’s safety and prosperity depend on the quality of the intelligence we collect
and the analysis we produce, our ability to evaluate and share this information in a timely manner,

and our ability to counter intelligence threats. This is as true for the strategic intelligence that informs
executive decisions as it is for intelligence support to homeland security, state, local, and tribal govern-

ments, our troops, and critical national missions. We are working to better integrate the Intelligence
Community, while also enhancing the capabilities of our Intelligence Community members. We are
strengthening our partnerships with foreign intelligence services and sustaining strong ties with our
close allies. And we continue to invest in the men and women of the Intelligence Community.

Strategic Communications: Across all of our efforts, effective strategic communications are essential to
sustaining global legitimacy and supporting our policy aims. Aligning our actions with our words is a
shared responsibility that must be fostered by a culture of communication throughout government.
We must also be more effective in our deliberate communication and engagement and do a better job
understanding the attitudes, opinions, grievances, and concerns of peoples—not just elites—around
the world. Doing so allows us to convey credible, consistent messages and to develop effective plans,
while better understanding how our actions will be perceived. We must also use a broad range of meth-
ods for communicating with foreign publics, including new media.

The American People and the Private Sector: The ideas, values, energy, creativity, and resilience of our
citizens are America’s greatest resource. We will support the development of prepared, vigilant, and
engaged communities and underscore that our citizens are the heart of a resilient country. And we
must tap the ingenuity outside government through strategic partnerships with the private sector,
nongovernmental organizations, foundations, and community-based organizations. Such partnerships
are critical to U.S. success at home and abroad, and we will support them through enhanced opportuni-
ties for engagement, coordination, transparency, and information sharing.

 

 

III. Advancing Our Interests

To achieve the world we seek, the United States must apply our strategic approach in pursuit of four
enduring national interests:

e Security: The security of the United States, its citizens, and U.S. allies and partners.

e Prosperity: A strong, innovative, and growing U.S. economy in an open international economic
system that promotes opportunity and prosperity.

e Values: Respect for universal values at home and around the world.

e International Order: An international order advanced by U.S. leadership that promotes peace,
security, and opportunity through stronger cooperation to meet global challenges.

Each of these interests is inextricably linked to the others: no single interest can be pursued in isolation,
but at the same time, positive action in one area will help advance all four. The initiatives described
below do not encompass all of America’s national security concerns. However, they represent areas of
particular priority and areas where progress is critical to securing our country and renewing American
leadership in the years to come.

Security

“We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense. And for those
who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to
you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken—you cannot outlast us, and we

will defeat you.”
—President Barack Obama, Inaugural Address, January 20, 2009

The threats to our people, our homeland, and our interests have shifted dramatically in the last 20 years.
Competition among states endures, but instead of a single nuclear adversary, the United States is now
threatened by the potential spread of nuclear weapons to extremists who may not be deterred from
using them. Instead of a hostile expansionist empire, we now face a diverse array of challenges, from
a loose network of violent extremists to states that flout international norms or face internal collapse.
In addition to facing enemies on traditional battlefields, the United States must now be prepared for
asymmetric threats, such as those that target our reliance on space and cyberspace.

This Administration has no greater responsibility than protecting the American people. Furthermore,
we embrace America’s unique responsibility to promote international security—a responsibility that
flows from our commitments to allies, our leading role in supporting a just and sustainable international
order, and our unmatched military capabilities.

The United States remains the only nation able to project and sustain large-scale military operations
over extended distances. We maintain superior capabilities to deter and defeat adaptive enemies and

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

to ensure the credibility of security partnerships that are fundamental to regional and global security.
In this way, our military continues to underpin our national security and global leadership, and when
we use it appropriately, our security and leadership is reinforced. But when we overuse our military
might, or fail to invest in or deploy complementary tools, or act without partners, then our military is
overstretched, Americans bear a greater burden, and our leadership around the world is too narrowly
identified with military force. And we know that our enemies aim to overextend our Armed Forces and
to drive wedges between us and those who share our interests.

Therefore, we must continue to adapt and rebalance our instruments of statecraft. At home, we are inte-
grating our homeland security efforts seamlessly with other aspects of our national security approach,
and strengthening our preparedness and resilience. Abroad, we are strengthening alliances, forging new
partnerships, and using every tool of American power to advance our objectives—including enhanced
diplomatic and development capabilities with the ability both to prevent conflict and to work alongside
our military. We are strengthening international norms to isolate governments that flout them and to
marshal cooperation against nongovernmental actors who endanger our common security.

Strengthen Security and Resilience at Home

At home, the United States is pursuing a strategy capable of meeting the full range of threats and
hazards to our communities. These threats and hazards include terrorism, natural disasters, large-scale
cyber attacks, and pandemics. As we do everything within our power to prevent these dangers, we
also recognize that we will not be able to deter or prevent every single threat. That is why we must also
enhance our resilience—the ability to adapt to changing conditions and prepare for, withstand, and
rapidly recover from disruption. To keep Americans safe and secure at home, we are working to:

Enhance Security at Home: Security at home relies on our shared efforts to prevent and deter attacks
by identifying and interdicting threats, denying hostile actors the ability to operate within our borders,
protecting the nation’s critical infrastructure and key resources, and securing cyberspace. That is why
we are pursuing initiatives to protect and reduce vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure, at our borders,
ports, and airports, and to enhance overall air, maritime, transportation, and space and cyber security.
Building on this foundation, we recognize that the global systems that carry people, goods, and data
around the globe also facilitate the movement of dangerous people, goods, and data. Within these
systems of transportation and transaction, there are key nodes—for example, points of origin and
transfer, or border crossings—that represent opportunities for exploitation and interdiction. Thus, we
are working with partners abroad to confront threats that often begin beyond our borders. And we are
developing lines of coordination at home across Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, nongovernmental,
and private-sector partners, as well as individuals and communities.

Effectively Manage Emergencies: We are building our capability to prepare for disasters to reduce or
eliminate long-term effects to people and their property from hazards and to respond to and recover
from major incidents. To improve our preparedness, we are integrating domestic all hazards planning
at all levels of government and building key capabilities to respond to emergencies. We continue to
collaborate with communities to ensure preparedness efforts are integrated at all levels of government
with the private and nonprofit sectors. We are investing in operational capabilities and equipment, and

III. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS

improving the reliability and interoperability of communications systems for first responders. We are
encouraging domestic regional planning and integrated preparedness programs and will encourage
governmentat all levels to engage in long-term recovery planning. It is critical that we continually test
and improve plans using exercises that are realistic in scenario and consequences.

Empowering Communities to Counter Radicalization: Several recent incidences of violent extremists
in the United States who are committed to fighting here and abroad have underscored the threat to
the United States and our interests posed by individuals radicalized at home. Our best defenses against
this threat are well informed and equipped families, local communities, and institutions. The Federal
Government will invest in intelligence to understand this threat and expand community engagement
and development programs to empower local communities. And the Federal Government, drawing
on the expertise and resources from all relevant agencies, will clearly communicate our policies and
intentions, listening to local concerns, tailoring policies to address regional concerns, and making clear
that our diversity is part of our strength—not a source of division or insecurity.

Improve Resilience Through Increased Public-Private Partnerships: When incidents occur, we must show
resilience by maintaining critical operations and functions, returning to our normal life, and learning
from disasters so that their lessons can be translated into pragmatic changes when necessary. The
private sector, which owns and operates most of the nation’s critical infrastructure, plays a vital role in
preparing for and recovering from disasters. We must, therefore, strengthen public-private partnerships
by developing incentives for government and the private sector to design structures and systems that
can withstand disruptions and mitigate associated consequences, ensure redundant systems where
necessary to maintain the ability to operate, decentralize critical operations to reduce our vulnerability
to single points of disruption, develop and test continuity plans to ensure the ability to restore critical
capabilities, and invest in improvements and maintenance of existing infrastructure.

Engage with Communities and Citizens: We will emphasize individual and community preparedness
and resilience through frequent engagement that provides clear and reliable risk and emergency
information to the public. A key part of this effort is providing practical steps that all Americans can
take to protect themselves, their families, and their neighbors. This includes transmitting information
through multiple pathways and to those with special needs. In addition, we support efforts to develop
a nationwide public safety broadband network. Our efforts to inform and empower Americans and their
communities recognize that resilience has always been at the heart of the American spirit.

Disrupt, Dismantle, and Defeat Al-Qa’ida and its Violent Extremist Affiliates in
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Around the World

The United States is waging a global campaign against al-Qa’ida and its terrorist affiliates. To disrupt,
dismantle and defeat al-Qa'ida and its affiliates, we are pursuing a strategy that protects our homeland,
secures the world’s most dangerous weapons and material, denies al-Qa’ida safe haven, and builds
positive partnerships with Muslim communities around the world. Success requires a broad, sustained,
and integrated campaign that judiciously applies every tool of American power—both military and
civilian—as well as the concerted efforts of like-minded states and multilateral institutions.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

We will always seek to delegitimize the use of terrorism and to isolate those who carry it out. Yet this is
not a global war against a tactic—terrorism or a religion—Islam. We are at war with a specific network,
al-Qa’ida, and its terrorist affiliates who support efforts to attack the United States, our allies, and partners.

Prevent Attacks on and in the Homeland: To prevent acts of terrorism on American soil, we must enlist
all of our intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security capabilities. We will continue to inte-
grate and leverage state and major urban area fusion centers that have the capability to share classified
information; establish a nationwide framework for reporting suspicious activity; and implement an
integrated approach to our counterterrorism information systems to ensure that the analysts, agents,
and officers who protect us have access to all relevant intelligence throughout the government. We
are improving information sharing and cooperation by linking networks to facilitate Federal, state, and
local capabilities to seamlessly exchange messages and information, conduct searches, and collaborate.
We are coordinating better with foreign partners to identify, track, limit access to funding, and prevent
terrorist travel. Recognizing the inextricable link between domestic and transnational security, we will
collaborate bilaterally, regionally, and through international institutions to promote global efforts to
prevent terrorist attacks.

Strengthen Aviation Security: We know that the aviation system has been a particular target of al-Qa'ida
and its affiliates. We must continue to bolster aviation security worldwide through a focus on increased
information collection and sharing, stronger passenger vetting and screening measures, the develop-
ment and development of advanced screening technologies, and cooperation with the international
community to strengthen aviation security standards and efforts around the world.

Deny Terrorists Weapons of Mass Destruction: To prevent acts of terrorism with the world’s most danger-
ous weapons, we are dramatically accelerating and intensifying efforts to secure all vulnerable nuclear
materials by the end of 2013, and to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. We will also take actions
to safeguard knowledge and capabilities in the life and chemical sciences that could be vulnerable to
misuse.

Deny Al-Qa’ida the Ability to Threaten the American People, Our Allies, Our Partners and Our Interests
Overseas: Al-Qa’ida and its allies must not be permitted to gain or retain any capacity to plan and launch
international terrorist attacks, especially against the U.S. homeland. Al Qa’ida’s core in Pakistan remains
the most dangerous component of the larger network, but we also face a growing threat from the
group's allies worldwide. We must deny these groups the ability to conduct operational plotting from
any locale, or to recruit, train, and position operatives, including those from Europe and North America.

Afghanistan and Pakistan: This is the epicenter of the violent extremism practiced by al Qa’ida. The
danger from this region will only grow if its security slides backward, the Taliban controls large swaths of
Afghanistan, and al-Qa’ida is allowed to operate with impunity. To prevent future attacks on the United
States, our allies, and partners, we must work with others to keep the pressure on al-Qa'ida and increase
the security and capacity of our partners in this region.

In Afghanistan, we must deny al-Qaida a safe haven, deny the Taliban the ability to overthrow the gov-
ernment, and strengthen the capacity of Afghanistan's security forces and government so that they can
take lead responsibility for Afghanistan's future. Within Pakistan, we are working with the government
to address the local, regional, and global threat from violent extremists.

* 20 *

III. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS

We will achieve these objectives with a strategy comprised of three components.

e First, our military and International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) partners within Afghanistan
are targeting the insurgency, working to secure key population centers, and increasing efforts
to train Afghan security forces. These military resources will allow us to create the conditions to
transition to Afghan responsibility. In July 2011, we will begin reducing our troops responsibly,
taking into account conditions on the ground. We will continue to advise and assist Afghanistan's
Security Forces so that they can succeed over the long term.

e Second, we will continue to work with our partners, the United Nations, and the Afghan
Government to improve accountable and effective governance. As we work to advance our
strategic partnership with the Afghan Government, we are focusing assistance on supporting
the President of Afghanistan and those ministries, governors, and local leaders who combat
corruption and deliver for the people. Our efforts will be based upon performance, and we will
measure progress. We will also target our assistance to areas that can make an immediate and
enduring impact in the lives of the Afghan people, such as agriculture, while supporting the
human rights of all of Afghanistan’s people—women and men. This will support our long-term
commitment to a relationship between our two countries that supports a strong, stable, and
prosperous Afghanistan.

e Third, we will foster a relationship with Pakistan founded upon mutual interests and mutual
respect. To defeat violent extremists who threaten both of our countries, we will strengthen
Pakistan's capacity to target violent extremists within its borders, and continue to provide
security assistance to support those efforts. To strengthen Pakistan’s democracy and develop-
ment, we will provide substantial assistance responsive to the needs of the Pakistani people,
and sustain a long-term partnership committed to Pakistan’s future. The strategic partnership
that we are developing with Pakistan includes deepening cooperation in a broad range of
areas, addressing both security and civilian challenges, and we will continue to expand those
ties through our engagement with Pakistan in the years to come.

Deny Safe Havens and Strengthen At-Risk States: Wherever al-Qa'ida or its terrorist affiliates attempt
to establish a safe haven—as they have in Yemen, Somalia, the Maghreb, and the Sahel—we will meet
them with growing pressure. We also will strengthen our own network of partners to disable al-Qa’ida’s
financial, human, and planning networks; disrupt terrorist operations before they mature; and address
potential safe-havens before al-Qa’ida and its terrorist affiliates can take root. These efforts will focus on
information-sharing, law enforcement cooperation, and establishing new practices to counter evolving
adversaries. We will also help states avoid becoming terrorist safe havens by helping them build their
capacity for responsible governance and security through development and security sector assistance.

Deliver Swift and Sure Justice: To effectively detain, interrogate, and prosecute terrorists, we need
durable legal approaches consistent with our security and our values. We adhere to several principles:
we will leverage all available information and intelligence to disrupt attacks and dismantle al-Qa‘ida and
affiliated terrorist organizations; we will bring terrorists to justice; we will act in line with the rule of law
and due process; we will submit decisions to checks and balances and accountability; and we will insist
that matters of detention and secrecy are addressed in a manner consistent with our Constitution and

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

laws. To deny violent extremists one of their most potent recruitment tools, we will close the prison at
Guantanamo Bay.

Resist Fear and Overreaction: The goal of those who perpetrate terrorist attacks is in part to sow fear. If we
respond with fear, we allow violent extremists to succeed far beyond the initial impact of their attacks, or
attempted attacks—altering our society and enlarging the standing of al-Qa'ida and its terrorist affiliates
far beyond its actual reach. Similarly, overreacting in a way that creates fissures between America and
certain regions or religions will undercut our leadership and make us less safe.

Contrast Al-Qa’ida’s Intent to Destroy with Our Constructive Vision: While violent extremists seek to
destroy, we will make clear our intent to build. We are striving to build bridges among people of different
faiths and regions. We will continue to work to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, which has long been a
source of tension. We will continue to stand up for the universal rights of all people, even for those with
whom we disagree. We are developing new partnerships in Muslim communities around the world on
behalf of health, education, science, employment, and innovation. And through our broader emphasis
on Muslim engagement, we will communicate our commitment to support the aspirations of all people
for security and opportunity. Finally, we reject the notion that al-Qa’‘ida represents any religious author-
ity. They are not religious leaders, they are killers; and neither Islam nor any other religion condones the
slaughter of innocents.

 

Use of Force

Military force, at times, may be necessary to defend our country and allies or to preserve broader peace
and security, including by protecting civilians facing a grave humanitarian crisis. We will draw on diplo-
macy, development, and international norms and institutions to help resolve disagreements, prevent
conflict, and maintain peace, mitigating where possible the need for the use of force. This means credibly
underwriting U.S. defense commitments with tailored approaches to deterrence and ensuring the U.S.
military continues to have the necessary capabilities across all domains—land, air, sea, space, and cyber. It
also includes helping our allies and partners build capacity to fulfill their responsibilities to contribute to
regional and global security.

While the use of force is sometimes necessary, we will exhaust other options before war whenever we can,
and carefully weigh the costs and risks of action against the costs and risks of inaction. When force is neces-
sary, we will continue to do so in a way that reflects our values and strengthens our legitimacy, and we will
seek broad international support, working with such institutions as NATO and the U.N. Security Council.

The United States must reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend our nation and our inter-
ests, yet we will also seek to adhere to standards that govern the use of force. Doing so strengthens those
who act in line with international standards, while isolating and weakening those who do not. We will also
outline a clear mandate and specific objectives and thoroughly consider the consequences —intended
and unintended—of our actions. And the United States will take care when sending the men and women
of our Armed Forces into harm’s way to ensure they have the leadership, training, and equipment they
require to accomplish their mission.

III. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS

Reverse the Spread of Nuclear and Biological Weapons and Secure Nuclear
Materials

The American people face no greater or more urgent danger than a terrorist attack with a nuclear
weapon. And international peace and security is threatened by proliferation that could lead to a nuclear
exchange. Indeed, since the end of the Cold War, the risk of a nuclear attack has increased. Excessive
Cold War stockpiles remain. More nations have acquired nuclear weapons. Testing has continued. Black
markets trade in nuclear secrets and materials. Terrorists are determined to buy, build, or steal a nuclear
weapon. Our efforts to contain these dangers are centered in a global nonproliferation regime that has
frayed as more people and nations break the rules.

That is why reversing the spread of nuclear weapons is a top priority. Success depends upon broad
consensus and concerted action, we will move forward strategically on a number of fronts through our
example, our partnerships, and a reinvigorated international regime. The United States will:

Pursue the Goal of a World Without Nuclear Weapons: While this goal will not be reached during this
Administration, its active pursuit and eventual achievement will increase global security, keep our
commitment under the NPT, build our cooperation with Russia and other states, and increase our cred-
ibility to hold others accountable for their obligations. As long as any nuclear weapons exist, the United
States will sustain a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal, both to deter potential adversaries and
to assure U.S. allies and other security partners that they can count on America’s security commitments.
But we have signed and seek to ratify a landmark New START Treaty with Russia to substantially limit our
deployed nuclear warheads and strategic delivery vehicles, while assuring a comprehensive monitoring
regime. We are reducing the role of nuclear weapons in our national security approach, extending a
negative security assurance not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against those nonnuclear
nations that are in compliance with the NPT and their nuclear nonproliferation obligations, and investing
in the modernization of a safe, secure, and effective stockpile without the production of new nuclear
weapons. We will pursue ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. And we will seek a new treaty
that verifiably ends the production of fissile materials intended for use in nuclear weapons.

Strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty: The basic bargain of the NPT is sound: countries with
nuclear weapons will move toward disarmament; countries without nuclear weapons will forsake
them; and all countries can access peaceful nuclear energy. To strengthen the NPT, we will seek more
resources and authority for international inspections. We will develop a new framework for civil nuclear
cooperation. As members of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership have agreed, one important ele-
ment of an enhanced framework could be cradle-to-grave nuclear fuel management. We will pursue a
broad, international consensus to insist that all nations meet their obligations. And we will also pursue
meaningful consequences for countries that fail to meet their obligations under the NPT or to meet the
requirements for withdrawing from it.

Present a Clear Choice to Iran and North Korea: The United States will pursue the denuclearization of the
Korean peninsula and work to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. This is not about singling
out nations—it is about the responsibilities of all nations and the success of the nonproliferation regime.
Both nations face a clear choice. If North Korea eliminates its nuclear weapons program, and Iran meets
its international obligations on its nuclear program, they will be able to proceed on a path to greater

* 23 *

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

political and economic integration with the international community. If they ignore their international
obligations, we will pursue multiple means to increase their isolation and bring them into compliance
with international nonproliferation norms.

Secure Vulnerable Nuclear Weapons and Material: The Global Nuclear Security Summit of 2010 rallied 47
nations behind the goal of securing all nuclear materials from terrorist groups. By the end of 2013, we
will seek to complete a focused international effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the
world through enhanced protection and accounting practices, expanded cooperation with and through
international institutions, and new partnerships to lock down these sensitive materials. To detect and
intercept nuclear materials in transit, and to stop the illicit trade in these technologies, we will work to
turn programs such as the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear
Terrorism into durable international efforts. And we will sustain broad-based cooperation with other
nations and international institutions to ensure the continued improvements necessary to protect
nuclear materials from evolving threats.

Support Peaceful Nuclear Energy: As countries move increasingly to tap peaceful nuclear energy to
provide power generation while advancing climate goals, the world must develop an infrastructure
in the countries that seek to use nuclear energy for their energy security needs and climate goals to
ensure that nuclear energy is developed in a safer manner. We will do so by promoting safety through
regulatory bodies and training of operators, promoting physical security to prevent terrorist acts, and
assuring safe and secure handling of fuel at the front and back ends of the nuclear fuel cycle.

Counter Biological Threats: The effective dissemination of a lethal biological agent within a population
center would endanger the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and have unprecedented eco-
nomic, societal, and political consequences. We must continue to work at home with first responders
and health officials to reduce the risk associated with unintentional or deliberate outbreaks of infectious
disease and to strengthen our resilience across the spectrum of high-consequence biological threats.
We will work with domestic and international partners to protect against biological threats by promot-
ing global health security and reinforcing norms of safe and responsible conduct; obtaining timely
and accurate insight on current and emerging risks; taking reasonable steps to reduce the potential
for exploitation; expanding our capability to prevent, attribute, and apprehend those who carry out
attacks; communicating effectively with all stakeholders; and helping to transform the international
dialogue on biological threats.

Advance Peace, Security, and Opportunity in the Greater Middle East

The United States has important interests in the greater Middle East. They include broad cooperation on
a wide range of issues with our close friend, Israel, and an unshakable commitment to its security; the
achievement of the Palestinian people's legitimate aspirations for statehood, opportunity, and the real-
ization of their extraordinary potential; the unity and security of Iraq and the fostering of its democracy
and reintegration into the region; the transformation of Iranian policy away from its pursuit of nuclear
weapons, support for terrorism, and threats against its neighbors; nonproliferation; and counterterrorism
cooperation, access to energy, and integration of the region into global markets.

* 24

III. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS

At the same time, our engagement must be both comprehensive and strategic. It should extend beyond
near-term threats by appealing to peoples’ aspirations for justice, education, and opportunity and by
pursuing a positive and sustainable vision of U.S. partnership with the region. Furthermore, our relation-
ship with our Israeli and Arab friends and partners in the region extends beyond our commitment to its
security and includes the continued ties we share in areas such as trade, exchanges, and cooperation
ona broad range of issues.

Complete a Responsible Transition as We End the War in Iraq: The war in Iraq presents a distinct and
important challenge to the United States, the international community, the lraqi people, and the region.
America’s servicemen and women, along with our coalition partners, have performed remarkably in
fighting determined enemies and have worked with our civilians to help the Iraqi people regain control
of their own destiny. Going forward, we have a responsibility, for our own security and the security of
the region, to successfully end the war through a full transition to Iraqi responsibility. We will cultivate
an enduring relationship with lraq based on mutual interests and mutual respect.

Our goal is an Iraq that is sovereign, stable, and self-reliant. To achieve that goal, we are continuing to
promote an Iraqi Government that is just, representative, and accountable and that denies support and
safe haven to terrorists. The United States will pursue no claim on Iraqi territory or resources, and we
will keep our commitments to Iraq’s democratically elected government. These efforts will build new
ties of trade and commerce between Iraq and the world, enable Iraq to assume its rightful place in the
community of nations, and contribute to the peace and security of the region.

We are pursuing these objectives with a strategy that has three core components.

e Transition Security: First, we are transitioning security to full Iraqi responsibility. We will end the
combat mission in Iraq by the end of August 2010. We will continue to train, equip, and advise
Iraqi Security Forces; conduct targeted counterterrorism missions; and protect ongoing civilian
and military efforts in Iraq. And, consistent with our commitments to the lraqi Government,
including the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement, we will remove all of our troops from Iraq by the
end of 2011.

¢ Civilian Support: Second, as the security situation continues to improve, U.S. civilian engage-
ment will deepen and broaden. We will sustain a capable political, diplomatic, and civilian effort
to help the Iraqi people as they resolve outstanding differences, integrate those refugees and
displaced persons who can return, and continue to develop accountable democratic institu-
tions that can better serve their basic needs. We will work with our Iraqi partners to implement
the Strategic Framework Agreement, with the Department of State taking the lead. This will
include cooperation on a range of issues including defense and security cooperation, political
and diplomatic cooperation, rule of law, science, health, education, and economics.

e Regional Diplomacy and Development: Third, we will continue to pursue comprehensive
engagement across the region to ensure that our drawdown in Iraq provides an opportunity
to advance lasting security and sustainable development for both Iraq and the broader Middle
East. The United States will continue to retain a robust civilian presence commensurate with
our strategic interests in the country and the region. We are transforming our relationship to
one consistent with other strategic partners in the region.

* 25 &

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

Pursue Arab-Israeli Peace: The United States, Israel, the Palestinians, and the Arab States have an interest
in a peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict—one in which the legitimate aspirations of Israelis
and Palestinians for security and dignity are realized, and Israel achieves a secure and lasting peace with
all of its neighbors.

The United States seeks two states living side by side in peace and security—a Jewish state of Israel, with
true security, acceptance, and rights for all Israelis; and a viable, independent Palestine with contiguous
territory that ends the occupation that began in 1967 and realizes the potential of the Palestinian people.
We will continue to work regionally and with like-minded partners in order to advance negotiations
that address the permanent-status issues: security for Israelis and Palestinians; borders, refugees, and
Jerusalem. We also seek international support to build the institutions upon which a Palestinian state
will depend, while supporting economic development that can bring opportunity to its people.

Any Arab-Israeli peace will only be lasting if harmful regional interference ends and constructive regional
support deepens. As we pursue peace between Israelis and Palestinians, we will also pursue peace
between Israel and Lebanon, Israel and Syria, and a broader peace between Israel and its neighbors. We
will pursue regional initiatives with multilateral participation, alongside bilateral negotiations.

Promote a Responsible Iran: For decades, the Islamic Republic of Iran has endangered the security of
the region and the United States and failed to live up to its international responsibilities. In addition
to its illicit nuclear program, it continues to support terrorism, undermine peace between Israelis and
Palestinians, and deny its people their universal rights. Many years of refusing to engage Iran failed to
reverse these trends; on the contrary, lran’s behavior became more threatening. Engagement is some-
thing we pursue without illusion. It can offer Iran a pathway to a better future, provided Iran's leaders
are prepared to take it. But that better pathway can only be achieved if Iran’s leaders change course,
act to restore the confidence of the international community, and fulfill their obligations. The United
States seeks a future in which Iran meets its international responsibilities, takes its rightful place in the
community of nations, and enjoys the political and economic opportunities that its people deserve.
Yet if the Iranian Government continues to refuse to live up to its international obligations, it will face
greater isolation.

Invest in the Capacity of Strong and Capable Partners

Where governments are incapable of meeting their citizens’ basic needs and fulfilling their responsibili-
ties to provide security within their borders, the consequences are often global and may directly threaten
the American people. To advance our common security, we must address the underlying political and
economic deficits that foster instability, enable radicalization and extremism, and ultimately undermine
the ability of governments to manage threats within their borders and to be our partners in addressing
common challenges. To invest in the capacity of strong and capable partners, we will work to:

Foster Security and Reconstruction in the Aftermath of Conflict: The United States and the international
community cannot shy away from the difficult task of pursuing stabilization in conflict and post-conflict
environments. In countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, building the capacity necessary for security, eco-
nomic growth, and good governance is the only path to long term peace and security. But we have also
learned that the effectiveness of these efforts is profoundly affected by the capacity of governments and

* 26 *

III. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS

the political will of their leaders. We will take these constraints into account in designing appropriate
assistance strategies and will facilitate the kind of collaboration that is essential—within our govern-
ment and with international organizations—in those instances when we engage in the difficult work
of helping to bring conflicts to an end.

Pursue Sustainable and Responsible Security Systems in At-Risk States: Proactively investing in stronger
societies and human welfare is far more effective and efficient than responding after state collapse.
The United States must improve its capability to strengthen the security of states at risk of conflict and
violence. We will undertake long-term, sustained efforts to strengthen the capacity of security forces to
guarantee internal security, defend against external threats, and promote regional security and respect
for human rights and the rule of law. We will also continue to strengthen the administrative and oversight
capability of civilian security sector institutions, and the effectiveness of criminal justice.

Prevent the Emergence of Conflict: Our strategy goes beyond meeting the challenges of today, and
includes preventing the challenges and seizing the opportunities of tomorrow. This requires investing
now in the capable partners of the future; building today the capacity to strengthen the foundations of
our common security, and modernizing our capabilities in order to ensure that we are agile in the face
of change. We have already begun to reorient and strengthen our development agenda; to take stock
of and enhance our capabilities; and to forge new and more effective means of applying the skills of our
military, diplomats, and development experts. These kinds of measures will help us diminish military risk,
act before crises and conflicts erupt, and ensure that governments are better able to serve their people.

Secure Cyberspace

Cybersecurity threats represent one of the most serious national security, public safety, and economic
challenges we face as a nation. The very technologies that empower us to lead and create also empower
those who would disrupt and destroy. They enable our military superiority, but our unclassified govern-
ment networks are constantly probed by intruders. Our daily lives and public safety depend on power
and electric grids, but potential adversaries could use cyber vulnerabilities to disrupt them on a massive
scale. The Internet and e-commerce are keys to our economic competitiveness, but cyber criminals
have cost companies and consumers hundreds of millions of dollars and valuable intellectual property.

The threats we face range from individual criminal hackers to organized criminal groups, from terrorist
networks to advanced nation states. Defending against these threats to our security, prosperity, and
personal privacy requires networks that are secure, trustworthy, and resilient. Our digital infrastruc-
ture, therefore, is a strategic national asset, and protecting it—while safeguarding privacy and civil
liberties—is a national security priority. We will deter, prevent, detect, defend against, and quickly recover
from cyber intrusions and attacks by:

Investing in People and Technology: To advance that goal, we are working across the government and
with the private sector to design more secure technology that gives us the ability to better protect and
to improve the resilience of critical government and industry systems and networks. We will continue
to invest in the cutting-edge research and development necessary for the innovation and discovery
we need to meet these challenges. We have begun a comprehensive national campaign to promote

* 27 kk

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

cybersecurity awareness and digital literacy from our boardrooms to our classrooms and to build a
digital workforce for the 21st century.

Strengthening Partnerships: Neither government nor the private sector nor individual citizens can meet
this challenge alone—we will expand the ways we work together. We will also strengthen our interna-
tional partnerships on a range of issues, including the development of norms for acceptable conduct
in cyberspace; laws concerning cybercrime; data preservation, protection, and privacy; and approaches
for network defense and response to cyber attacks. We will work with all the key players— including
all levels of government and the private sector, nationally and internationally—to investigate cyber
intrusion and to ensure an organized and unified response to future cyber incidents. Just as we do for
natural disasters, we have to have plans and resources in place beforehand.

Prosperity

“The answers to our problems don't lie beyond our reach. They exist in our laboratories
and universities; in our fields and our factories; in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs
and the pride of the hardest-working people on Earth. Those qualities that have made
America the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history we still possess in
ample measure. What is required now is for this country to pull together, confront boldly
the challenges we face, and take responsibility for our future once more.”

—President Barack Obama, Address to Joint Session of Congress, February 24, 2009

The foundation of American leadership must be a prosperous American economy. And a growing and
open global economy serves as a source of opportunity for the American people and a source of strength
for the United States. The free flow of information, people, goods, and services has also advanced peace
among nations, as those places that have emerged more prosperous are often more stable. Yet we have
also seen how shocks to the global economy can precipitate disaster—including the loss of jobs, a
decline in standards of living in parts of our country, and instability and a loss of U.S. influence abroad.
Meanwhile, growing prosperity around the world has made economic power more diffuse, creating a
more competitive environment for America’s people and businesses.

To allow each American to pursue the opportunity upon which our prosperity depends, we must
build a stronger foundation for economic growth. That foundation must include access to a complete
and competitive education for every American; a transformation of the way that we produce and use
energy, so that we reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and lead the world in creating new jobs and
industry; access to quality, affordable health care so our people, businesses, and government are not
constrained by rising costs; and the responsible management of our Federal budget so that we balance
our priorities and are not burdened by debt. To succeed, we must also ensure that America stays on the
cutting edge of the science and innovation that supports our prosperity, defense, and international
technological leadership.

* 28 *

III. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS

This new foundation must underpin and sustain an international economic system that is critical to both
our prosperity and to the peace and security of the world. We must reinvigorate and fortify it for the
21st century: by preventing cycles of boom and bust with new rules of the road at home and abroad; by
saving more and spending less; by resisting protectionism and promoting trade that is free and fair; by
coordinating our actions with other countries, and reforming international institutions to give emerging
economies a greater voice and greater responsibility; and by supporting development that promotes
good governance, unleashes the potential of different populations, and creates new markets overseas.
Taken together, these actions can ensure inclusive growth that is balanced and sustained.

Strengthen Education and Human Capital

Ina global economy of vastly increased mobility and interdependence, our own prosperity and leader-
ship depends increasingly on our ability to provide our citizens with the education that they need to
succeed, while attracting the premier human capital for our workforce. We must ensure that the most
innovative ideas take root in America, while providing our people with the skills that they need to
compete. That means we must:

Improve Education at All Levels: The United States has lost ground in education, even as our competi-
tiveness depends on educating our children to succeed in a global economy based on knowledge and
innovation. We are working to provide a complete and competitive education for all Americans, to
include supporting high standards for early learning, reforming public schools, increasing access to
higher education and job training, and promoting high-demand skills and education for emerging
industries. We will also restore U.S. leadership in higher education by seeking the goal of leading the
world in the proportion of college graduates by 2020.

Invest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Education (STEM): America’s long-term leader-
ship depends on educating and producing future scientists and innovators. We will invest more in
STEM education so students can learn to think critically in science, math, engineering, and technology;
improve the quality of math and science teaching so American students are no longer outperformed
by those in other nations; and expand STEM education and career opportunities for underrepresented
groups, including women and girls. We will work with partners—from the private-sector and nonprofit
organizations to universities—to promote education and careers in science and technology.

Increase International Education and Exchange: The pervasiveness of the English language and American
cultural influence are great advantages to Americans traveling, working, and negotiating in foreign
countries. But we must develop skills to help us succeed in a dynamic and diverse global economy. We
will support programs that cultivate interest and scholarship in foreign languages and intercultural
affairs, including international exchange programs. This will allow our citizens to build connections with
peoples overseas and to develop skills and contacts that will help them thrive in the global economy.
We must also welcome more foreign exchange students to our shores, recognizing the benefits that can
result from deeper ties with foreign publics and increased understanding of American society.

Pursue Comprehensive Immigration Reform: The United States is a nation of immigrants. Our ability to
innovate, our ties to the world, and our economic prosperity depend on our nation’s capacity to welcome
and assimilate immigrants, and a visa system which welcomes skilled professionals from around the

* 29

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

world. At the same time, effective border security and immigration enforcement must keep the country
safe and deter unlawful entry. Indeed, persistent problems in immigration policy consume valuable
resources needed to advance other security objectives and make it harder to focus on the most danger-
ous threats facing our country. Ultimately, our national security depends on striking a balance between
security and openness. To advance this goal, we must pursue comprehensive immigration reform that
effectively secures our borders, while repairing a broken system that fails to serve the needs of our nation.

Enhance Science, Technology, and Innovation

Reaffirming America’s role as the global engine of scientific discovery and technological innovation
has never been more critical. Challenges like climate change, pandemic disease, and resource scarcity
demand new innovation. Meanwhile, the nation that leads the world in building a clean energy economy
will enjoy a substantial economic and security advantage. That is why the Administration is investing
heavily in research, improving education in science and math, promoting developments in energy, and
expanding international cooperation.

Transform our Energy Economy: As long as we are dependent on fossil fuels, we need to ensure the
security and free flow of global energy resources. But without significant and timely adjustments, our
energy dependence will continue to undermine our security and prosperity. This will leave us vulnerable
to energy supply disruptions and manipulation and to changes in the environment on an unprecedented
scale.

The United States has a window of opportunity to lead in the development of clean energy technology.
If successful, the United States will lead in this new Industrial Revolution in clean energy that will be
a major contributor to our economic prosperity. If we do not develop the policies that encourage the
private sector to seize the opportunity, the United States will fall behind and increasingly become an
importer of these new energy technologies.

We have already made the largest investment in clean energy in history, but there is much more to do
to build on this foundation. We must continue to transform our energy economy, leveraging private
capital to accelerate deployment of clean energy technologies that will cut greenhouse gas emissions,
improve energy efficiency, increase use of renewable and nuclear power, reduce the dependence of
vehicles on oil, and diversify energy sources and suppliers. We will invest in research and next-generation
technology, modernize the way we distribute electricity, and encourage the usage of transitional fuels,
while moving towards clean energy produced at home.

Invest in Research: Research and development is central to our broader national capacity. Incidents
like the outbreak of H1N1 influenza and the challenge of identifying new, renewable sources of energy
highlight the importance of research in basic and applied science. We are reversing the decades-long
decline in federal funding for research, including the single largest infusion to basic science research
in American history. Research and innovation is not something government can do on its own, which
is why we will support and create incentives to encourage private initiatives. The United States has
always excelled in our ability to turn science and technology into engineering and products, and we
must continue to do so in the future.

* 30 *

III. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS

Expand International Science Partnerships: America’s scientific leadership has always been widely
admired around the world, and we must continue to expand cooperation and partnership in science
and technology. We have launched a number of Science Envoys around the globe and are promoting
stronger relationships between American scientists, universities, and researchers and their counterparts
abroad. We will reestablish a commitment to science and technology in our foreign assistance efforts
and develop a strategy for international science and national security.

Employ Technology to Protect our Nation: Our renewed commitment to science and technology—and
our ability to apply the ingenuity of our public and private sectors toward the most difficult foreign policy
and security challenges of our time—will help us protect our citizens and advance U.S. national security
priorities. These include, for example, protecting U.S. and allied forces from asymmetric attacks; support-
ing arms control and nonproliferation agreements; preventing terrorists from attacking our homeland;
preventing and managing widespread disease outbreaks; securing the supply chain; detecting weapons
of mass destruction before they reach our borders; and protecting our information, communication,
and transportation infrastructure.

Leverage and Grow our Space Capabilities: For over 50 years, our space community has been a catalyst
for innovation and a hallmark of U.S. technological leadership. Our space capabilities underpin global
commerce and scientific advancements and bolster our national security strengths and those of our
allies and partners. To promote security and stability in space, we will pursue activities consistent with
the inherent right of self-defense, deepen cooperation with allies and friends, and work with all nations
toward the responsible and peaceful use of space. To maintain the advantages afforded to the United
States by space, we must also take several actions. We must continue to encourage cutting-edge space
technology by investing in the people and industrial base that develops them. We will invest in the
research and development of next-generation space technologies and capabilities that benefit our
commercial, civil, scientific exploration, and national security communities, in order to maintain the
viability of space for future generations. And we will promote a unified effort to strengthen our space
industrial base and work with universities to encourage students to pursue space-related careers.

Achieve Balanced and Sustainable Growth

Balanced and sustainable growth, at home and throughout the global economy, drives the momentum
of the U.S. economy and underpins our prosperity. A steadily growing global economy means an expand-
ing market for exports of our goods and services. Over time, deepening linkages among markets and
businesses will provide the setting in which the energies and entrepreneurship of our private sector can
flourish, generating technologies, business growth, and job creation that will boost living standards for
Americans. United States economic leadership now has to adapt to the rising prominence of emerging
economies; the growing size, speed, and sophistication of financial markets; the multiplicity of market
participants around the globe; and the struggling economies that have so far failed to integrate into
the global system.

To promote prosperity for all Americans, we will need to lead the international community to expand the
inclusive growth of the integrated, global economy. At the same time, we will need to lead international
efforts to prevent a recurrence of economic imbalances and financial excesses, while managing the

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

many security threats and global challenges that affect global economic stability. To promote growth
that can be balanced and sustained, we will:

Prevent Renewed Instability in the Global Economy: The recent crisis taught us the very high cost of the
boom and bust cycle that has plagued the global economy and has served neither the United States
nor our international partners. Once Americans found themselves in debt or out of work, our demand
for foreign goods fell sharply. As foreign economies weakened, their financial institutions and public
finances came under stress too, reinforcing the global slowdown. We must prevent the reemergence
of imbalanced growth, with American consumers buying and borrowing, and Asian and other export-
ing countries selling and accumulating claims. We must pursue reform of the U.S. financial system to
strengthen the health of our economy and encourage Americans to save more. And we must prevent
the reemergence of excesses in our financial institutions based on irresponsible lending behavior, and
abetted by lax and uncoordinated regulation.

Save More And Export More: Striking a better balance at home means saving more and spending less,
reforming our financial system, and reducing our long-term budget deficit. With those changes, we will
see a greater emphasis on exports that we can build, produce, and sell all over the world, with the goal
of doubling U.S. exports by 2014. This is ultimately an employment strategy, because higher exports
will support millions of well-paying American jobs, including those that service innovative and profit-
able new technologies. As a part of that effort, we are reforming our export controls consistent with
our national security imperatives.

Shift To Greater Domestic Demand Abroad: For the rest of the world, especially in some emerging market
and developing countries, a better balance means placing greater emphasis on increasing domestic
demand as the leading driver of growth and opening markets. Those countries will be able to import
the capital and technologies needed to sustain the remarkable productivity gains already underway.
Rebalancing will provide an opportunity for workers and consumers over time to enjoy the higher
standards of living made possible by those gains. As balanced growth translates into sustained growth,
middle-income, and poor countries, many of which are not yet sufficiently integrated into the global
economy, can accelerate the process of convergence of living standards toward richer countries—a
process that will become a driver of growth for the global economy for decades to come.

Open Foreign Markets to Our Products and Services: The United States has long had one of the most
open markets in the world. We have been a leader in expanding an open trading system. That has
underwritten the growth of other developed and emerging markets alike. Openness has also forced
our companies and workers to compete and innovate, and at the same time, has offered market access
crucial to the success of so many countries around the world. We will maintain our open investment
environment, consistent with our national security goals. In this new era, opening markets around the
globe will promote global competition and innovation and will be crucial to our prosperity. We will
pursue a trade agenda that includes an ambitious and balanced Doha multilateral trade agreement,
bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that reflect our values and interests, and engagement with
the transpacific partnership countries to shape a regional agreement with high standards.

As we go forward, our trade policy will be an important part of our effort to capitalize on the opportuni-
ties presented by globalization, but will also be part of our effort to equip Americans to compete. To make

* 32 *

trade agreements work for Americans, we will take steps to restore confidence, with realistic programs
to deal with transition costs, and promote innovation, infrastructure, healthcare reform and education.
Our agreements will contain achievable enforcement mechanisms to ensure that the gains we negotiate
are in fact realized and will be structured to reflect U.S. interests, especially on labor and environment.

Build Cooperation with Our International Partners: The United States has supported the G-20's emer-
gence as the premier forum for international economic cooperation. This flows from the recognition that
we need a broader and more inclusive engagement with the countries responsible for most of global
output and trade. U.S. leadership in the G-20 will be focused on securing sustainable and balanced
growth, coordinating reform of financial sector regulation, fostering global economic development,
and promoting energy security. We also need official international financial institutions to be as modern
and agile as the global economy they serve. Through the G-20, we will pursue governance reform at
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. We will also broaden our leadership in other
international financial institutions so that the rapidly growing countries of the world see their repre-
sentation increase and are willing to invest those institutions with the authority they need to promote
the stability and growth of global output and trade.

Deterring Threats to the International Financial System: Today's open and global financial system also
exposes us to global financial threats. Just as we work to make the most of the opportunities that glo-
balization brings, the actors that pose a threat to our national security—terrorists, proliferators, narcotics
traffickers, corrupt officials, and others—are abusing the global financial system to raise, move, and safe-
guard funds that support their illicit activities or from which they derive profit. Their support networks
have global reach and are not contained by national borders. Our strategy to attack these networks
must respond in kind and target their illicit resources and access to the global financial system through
financial measures, administration and enforcement of regulatory authorities, outreach to the private
sector and our foreign partners, and collaboration on international standards and information sharing.

Accelerate Sustainable Development

The growth of emerging economies in recent decades has lifted people out of poverty and forged a
more interconnected and vibrant global economy. But development has been uneven, progress is fragile,
and too many of the world’s people still live without the benefits that development affords. While some
countries are growing, many lag behind—mired in insecurity, constrained by poor governance, or overly
dependent upon commodity prices. But sustained economic progress requires faster, sustainable, and
more inclusive development. That is why we are pursuing a range of specific initiatives in areas such
as food security and global health that will be essential to the future security and prosperity of nations
and peoples around the globe.

Increase Investments in Development: The United States has an interest in working with our allies to help
the world’s poorest countries grow into productive and prosperous economies governed by capable,
democratic, and accountable state institutions. We will ensure a greater and more deliberate focus
on a global development agenda across the United States Government, from policy analysis through
policy implementation. We are increasing our foreign assistance, expanding our investments in effective
multilateral development institutions, and leveraging the engagement of others to share the burden.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

Invest in the Foundations of Long-Term Development: The United States will initiate long-term invest-
ments that recognize and reward governments that demonstrate the capacity and political will to pursue
sustainable development strategies and ensure that all policy instruments at our disposal are harnessed
to these ends. And we will provide our support in multiple ways—by strengthening the ability of gov-
ernments and communities to manage development challenges and investing in strong institutions
that foster the democratic accountability that helps sustain development. This will expand the circle of
nations—particularly in Africa—who are capable of reaping the benefits of the global economy, while
contributing to global security and prosperity.

Exercise Leadership in the Provision of Global Public Goods: Our approach needs to reflect the fact that
there are a set of development challenges that strongly affect the likelihood of progress, but cannot be
addressed by individual countries acting alone. Particularly in Africa, these challenges—such as adap-
tation to global warming, the control of epidemic disease, and the knowledge to increase agricultural
productivity—are not adequately addressed in bilateral efforts. We will shape the international archi-
tecture and work with our global partners to address these challenges, and increase our investments
and engagement to transition to a low-carbon growth trajectory, support the resilience of the poorest
nations to the effects of climate change, and strengthen food security. We must also pursue potential
“game changers” for development such as new vaccines, weather-resistant seed varieties, and green
energy technologies.

Spend Taxpayers’ Dollars Wisely

The United States Government has an obligation to make the best use of taxpayer money, and our ability
to achieve long-term goals depends upon our fiscal responsibility. A responsible budget involves mak-
ing tough choices to live within our means; holding departments and agencies accountable for their
spending and their performance; harnessing technology to improve government performance; and
being open and honest with the American people. A responsible budget also depends upon working
with our global partners and institutions to share burdens and leverage U.S. investments to achieve
global goals. Our national security goals can only be reached if we make hard choices and work with
international partners to share burdens.

Reduce the Deficit: We cannot grow our economy in the long term unless we put the United States
back on a sustainable fiscal path. To begin this effort, the Administration has proposed a 3-year freeze
in nonsecurity discretionary spending, a new fee on the largest financial services companies to recoup
taxpayer losses for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and the closing of tax loopholes and
unnecessary subsidies. The Administration has created a bipartisan fiscal commission to suggest further
steps for medium-term deficit reduction and will work for fiscally responsible health insurance reform
that will bring down the rate of growth in health care costs, a key driver of the country’s fiscal future.

Reform Acquisition and Contracting Processes: Wasteful spending, duplicative programs, and contracts
with poor oversight have no place in the United States Government. Cost-effective and efficient pro-
cesses are particularly important for the Department of Defense, which accounts for approximately
70 percent of all Federal procurement spending. We will scrutinize our programs and terminate or
restructure those that are outdated, duplicative, ineffective, or wasteful. The result will be more relevant,

* 34 &

III. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS

capable, and effective programs and systems that our military wants and needs. We are also reforming
Federal contracting and strengthening contracting practices and management oversight with a goal
of saving Federal agencies $40 billion dollars a year.

Increase Transparency: Americans have a right to know how their tax dollars are spent, but that informa-
tion can be obscured or unavailable. In some instances, incomplete accounting of the budget has been
used to conceal the reality of our fiscal situation. To uphold our commitment to a transparent budget
process, we are simultaneously requesting both base budget and overseas contingency operations costs,
with the same amount of justification and explanatory material for each, so that Americans can see the
true cost of our war efforts and hold leaders accountable for decisions with all of the facts.

Values

“We uphold our most cherished values not only because doing so is right, but because
it strengthens our country and keeps us safe. Time and again, our values have been our
best national security asset—in war and peace, in times of ease, and in eras of upheaval.
Fidelity to our values is the reason why the United States of America grew from a small
string of colonies under the writ of an empire to the strongest nation in the world.”

—President Barack Obama, National Archives, May 21, 2009

The United States believes certain values are universal and will work to promote them worldwide. These
include an individual's freedom to speak their mind, assemble without fear, worship as they please,
and choose their own leaders; they also include dignity, tolerance, and equality among all people, and
the fair and equitable administration of justice. The United States was founded upon a belief in these
values. At home, fidelity to these values has extended the promise of America ever more fully, to ever
more people. Abroad, these values have been claimed by people of every race, region, and religion.
Most nations are parties to international agreements that recognize this commonality. And nations
that embrace these values for their citizens are ultimately more successful—and friendly to the United
States—than those that do not.

Yet after an era that saw substantial gains for these values around the world, democratic develop-
ment has stalled in recent years. In some cultures, these values are being equated with the ugly face
of modernity and are seen to encroach upon cherished identities. In other countries, autocratic rulers
have repressed basic human rights and democratic practices in the name of economic development
and national unity. Even where some governments have adopted democratic practices, authoritarian
rulers have undermined electoral processes and restricted the space for opposition and civil society,
imposing a growing number of legal restrictions so as to impede the rights of people to assemble and
to access information. And while there has been substantial progress in combating poverty in many
parts of the world, too many of the world’s people still lack the dignity that comes with the opportunity
to pursue a better life.

* 35 kk

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

The United States supports those who seek to exercise universal rights around the world. We promote
our values above all by living them at home. We continue to engage nations, institutions, and peoples in
pursuit of these values abroad. And we recognize the link between development and political progress.
In doing so, our goals are realistic, as we recognize that different cultures and traditions give life to these
values in distinct ways. Moreover, America’s influence comes not from perfection, but from our striving
to overcome our imperfections. The constant struggle to perfect our union is what makes the American
story inspiring. That is why acknowledging our past shortcomings—and highlighting our efforts to
remedy them—is a means of promoting our values.

America will not impose any system of government on another country, but our long-term security and
prosperity depends on our steady support for universal values, which sets us apart from our enemies,
adversarial governments, and many potential competitors for influence. We will do so through a variety
of means—by speaking out for universal rights, supporting fragile democracies and civil society, and
supporting the dignity that comes with development.

Strengthen the Power of Our Example

More than any other action that we have taken, the power of America’s example has helped spread
freedom and democracy abroad. That is why we must always seek to uphold these values not just when
it is easy, but when it is hard. Advancing our interests may involve new arrangements to confront threats
like terrorism, but these practices and structures must always be in line with our Constitution, preserve
our people's privacy and civil liberties, and withstand the checks and balances that have served us so
well. To sustain our fidelity to our values—and our credibility to promote them around the world—we
will continue to:

Prohibit Torture without Exception or Equivocation: Brutal methods of interrogation are inconsistent
with our values, undermine the rule of law, and are not effective means of obtaining information. They
alienate the United States from the world. They serve as a recruitment and propaganda tool for terror-
ists. They increase the will of our enemies to fight against us, and endanger our troops when they are
captured. The United States will not use or support these methods.

Legal Aspects of Countering Terrorism: The increased risk of terrorism necessitates a capacity to detain
and interrogate suspected violent extremists, but that framework must align with our laws to be effective
and sustainable. When we are able, we will prosecute terrorists in Federal courts or in reformed military
commissions that are fair, legitimate, and effective. For detainees who cannot be prosecuted—but pose
a danger to the American people—we must have clear, defensible, and lawful standards. We must have
fair procedures and a thorough process of periodic review, so that any prolonged detention is carefully
evaluated and justified. And keeping with our Constitutional system, it will be subject to checks and
balances. The goal is an approach that can be sustained by future Administrations, with support from
both political parties and all three branches of government.

Balance the Imperatives of Secrecy and Transparency: For the sake of our security, some information
must be protected from public disclosure—for instance, to protect our troops, our sources and methods
of intelligence-gathering or confidential actions that keep the American people safe. Yet our democ-
racy depends upon transparency, and whenever possible, we are making information available to the

* 36 *

III. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS

American people so that they can make informed judgments and hold their leaders accountable. For
instance, when we invoke the State Secrets privilege, we will follow clear procedures so as to provide
greater accountability and to ensure the privilege is invoked only when necessary and in the narrowest
way possible. We will never invoke the privilege to hide a violation of law or to avoid embarrassment
to the government.

Protect Civil Liberties, Privacy, and Oversight: Protecting civil liberties and privacy are integral to the
vibrancy of our democracy and the exercise of freedom. We are balancing our solemn commitments
to these virtues with the mandate to provide security for the American people. Vigorous oversight of
national security activities by our three branches of government and vigilant compliance with the rule of
law allow us to maintain this balance, affirm to our friends and allies the constitutional ideals we uphold.

Uphold the Rule of Law: The rule of law—and our capacity to enforce it—advances our national security
and strengthens our leadership. At home, fidelity to our laws and support for our law enforcement com-
munity safeguards American citizens and interests, while protecting and advancing our values. Around
the globe, it allows us to hold actors accountable, while supporting both international security and the
stability of the global economy. America’s commitment to the rule of law is fundamental to our efforts to
build an international order that is capable of confronting the emerging challenges of the 21st century.

Draw Strength from Diversity: The United States has benefited throughout our history when we have
drawn strength from our diversity. While those who advocate on behalf of extremist ideologies seek
to sow discord among ethnic and religious groups, America stands as an example of how people from
different backgrounds can be united through their commitment to shared values. Within our own
communities, those who seek to recruit and radicalize individuals will often try to prey upon isolation
and alienation. Our own commitment to extending the promise of America will both draw a contrast
with those who try to drive people apart, while countering attempts to enlist individuals in ideological,
religious, or ethnic extremism.

Promote Democracy and Human Rights Abroad

The United States supports the expansion of democracy and human rights abroad because governments
that respect these values are more just, peaceful, and legitimate. We also do so because their success
abroad fosters an environment that supports America’s national interests. Political systems that protect
universal rights are ultimately more stable, successful, and secure. As our history shows, the United States
can more effectively forge consensus to tackle shared challenges when working with governments that
reflect the will and respect the rights of their people, rather than just the narrow interests of those in
power. The United States is advancing universal values by:

Ensuring that New and Fragile Democracies Deliver Tangible Improvements for Their Citizens: The
United States must support democracy, human rights, and development together, as they are mutually
reinforcing. We are working closely with citizens, communities, and political and civil society leaders
to strengthen key institutions of democratic accountability—free and fair electoral processes, strong
legislatures, civilian control of militaries, honest police forces, independent and fair judiciaries, a free
and independent press, a vibrant private sector, and a robust civil society. To do so, we are harnessing

x 37 kk

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

our bilateral and multilateral capabilities to help nascent democracies deliver services that respond
to the needs and preferences of their citizens, since democracies without development rarely survive.

Practicing Principled Engagement with Non-Democratic Regimes: Even when we are focused on
interests such as counterterrorism, nonproliferation, or enhancing economic ties, we will always seek
in parallel to expand individual rights and opportunities through our bilateral engagement. The United
States is pursuing a dual-track approach in which we seek to improve government-to-government
relations and use this dialogue to advance human rights, while engaging civil society and peaceful
political opposition, and encouraging U.S. nongovernmental actors to do the same. More substantive
government-to-government relations can create permissive conditions for civil society to operate and
for more extensive people-to-people exchanges. But when our overtures are rebuffed, we must lead
the international community in using public and private diplomacy, and drawing on incentives and
disincentives, in an effort to change repressive behavior.

Recognizing the Legitimacy of All Peaceful Democratic Movements: America respects the right of all
peaceful, law-abiding, and nonviolent voices to be heard around the world, even if we disagree with
them. Support for democracy must not be about support for specific candidates or movements. America
will welcome all legitimately elected, peaceful governments, provided they govern with respect for
the rights and dignity of all their people and consistent with their international obligations. Those who
seek democracy to obtain power, but are ruthless once they do, will forfeit the support of the United
States. Governments must maintain power through consent, not coercion, and place legitimate political
processes above party or narrow interest.

Supporting the Rights of Women and Girls: Women should have access to the same opportunities and
be able to make the same choices as men. Experience shows that countries are more peaceful and
prosperous when women are accorded full and equal rights and opportunity. When those rights and
opportunities are denied, countries often lag behind. Furthermore, women and girls often dispropor-
tionally bear the burden of crises and conflict. Therefore the United States is working with regional and
international organizations to prevent violence against women and girls, especially in conflict zones.
We are supporting women’s equal access to justice and their participation in the political process. We
are promoting child and maternal health. We are combating human trafficking, especially in women
and girls, through domestic and international law enforcement. And we are supporting education,
employment, and micro-finance to empower women globally.

Strengthening International Norms Against Corruption: We are working within the broader international
system, including the U.N., G-20, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),
and the international financial institutions, to promote the recognition that pervasive corruption is a
violation of basic human rights and a severe impediment to development and global security. We will
work with governments and civil society organizations to bring greater transparency and accountability
to government budgets, expenditures, and the assets of public officials. And we will institutionalize
transparent practices in international aid flows, international banking and tax policy, and private sec-
tor engagement around natural resources to make it harder for officials to steal and to strengthen the
efforts of citizens to hold their governments accountable.

* 38

III. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS

Building a Broader Coalition of Actors to Advance Universal Values: We are working to build support
for democracy, rule of law, and human rights by working with other governments, nongovernmental
organizations, and multilateral fora. The United States is committed to working to shape and strengthen
existing institutions that are not delivering on their potential, such as the United Nations Human Rights
Council. We are working within the broader U.N. system and through regional mechanisms to strengthen
human rights monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, so that individuals and countries are held
accountable for their violation of international human rights norms. And we will actively support the
leadership of emerging democracies as they assume a more active role in advancing basic human rights
and democratic values in their regions and on the global stage.

Marshalling New Technologies and Promoting the Right to Access Information: The emergence of tech-
nologies such as the Internet, wireless networks, mobile smart-phones, investigative forensics, satellite
and aerial imagery, and distributed remote sensing infrastructure has created powerful new opportuni-
ties to advance democracy and human rights. These technologies have fueled people-powered political
movements, made it possible to shine a spotlight on human rights abuses nearly instantaneously, and
increased avenues for free speech and unrestricted communication around the world. We support the
dissemination and use of these technologies to facilitate freedom of expression, expand access to infor-
mation, increase governmental transparency and accountability, and counter restrictions on their use.
We will also better utilize such technologies to effectively communicate our own messages to the world.

Promote Dignity by Meeting Basic Needs

The freedom that America stands for includes freedom from want. Basic human rights cannot thrive in
places where human beings do not have access to enough food, or clean water, or the medicine they
need to survive. The United States has embraced the United Nation's Millennium Development Goals
and is working with others in pursuit of the eradication of extreme poverty—efforts that are particularly
critical to the future of nations and peoples of Africa. And we will continue to promote the dignity that
comes through development efforts such as:

Pursuing a Comprehensive Global Health Strategy: The United States has a moral and strategic interest
in promoting global health. When a child dies of a preventable disease, it offends our conscience; when
a disease goes unchecked, it can endanger our own health; when children are sick, development is
stalled. That is why we are continuing to invest in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Through the Global Health
Initiative, we will strengthen health systems and invest in interventions to address areas where progress
has lagged, including maternal and child health. And we are also pursuing the goal of reducing the
burden of malaria and tuberculosis and seeking the elimination of important neglected tropical diseases.

Promoting Food Security: The United States is working with partners around the world to advance a food
security initiative that combats hunger and builds the capacity of countries to feed their people. Instead
of simply providing aid for developing countries, we are focusing on new methods and technologies for
agricultural development. This is consistent with an approach in which aid is not an end in itself—the
purpose of our foreign assistance will be to create the conditions where it is no longer needed.

Leading Efforts to Address Humanitarian Crises: Together with the American people and the international
community, we will continue to respond to humanitarian crises to ensure that those in need have the

x 39 kk

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

protection and assistance they need. In such circumstances, we are also placing a greater emphasis on
fostering long-term recovery. Haiti's devastating earthquake is only the most recent reminder of the
human and material consequences of natural disasters, and a changing climate portends a future in
which the United States must be better prepared and resourced to exercise robust leadership to help
meet critical humanitarian needs.

International Order

“As President of the United States, I will work tirelessly to protect America’s security and
to advance our interests. But no one nation can meet the challenges of the 21st century
on its own, nor dictate its terms to the world. That is why America seeks an international
system that lets nations pursue their interests peacefully, especially when those interests
diverge; a system where the universal rights of human beings are respected, and violations
of those rights are opposed; a system where we hold ourselves to the same standards that
we apply to other nations, with clear rights and responsibilities for all.”

—President Barack Obama, Moscow, Russia, July 7, 2009

The United States will protect its people and advance our prosperity irrespective of the actions of any
other nation, but we have an interest in a just and sustainable international order that can foster collec-
tive action to confront common challenges. This international order will support our efforts to advance
security, prosperity, and universal values, but it is also an end that we seek in its own right. Because
without such an international order, the forces of instability and disorder will undermine global secu-
rity. And without effective mechanisms to forge international cooperation, challenges that recognize
no borders—such as climate change, pandemic disease, and transnational crime—will persist and
potentially spread.

International institutions—most prominently NATO and the United Nations—have been at the center
of our international order since the mid 20th century. Yet, an international architecture that was largely
forged in the wake of World War Il is buckling under the weight of new threats, making us less able to
seize new opportunities. Even though many defining trends of the 21st century affect all nations and
peoples, too often, the mutual interests of nations and peoples are ignored in favor of suspicion and
self-defeating competition.

What is needed, therefore, is a realignment of national actions and international institutions with shared
interests. And when national interests do collide—or countries prioritize their interests in different
ways—those nations that defy international norms or fail to meet their sovereign responsibilities will
be denied the incentives that come with greater integration and collaboration with the international
community.

No international order can be supported by international institutions alone. Our mutual interests must
be underpinned by bilateral, multilateral, and global strategies that address underlying sources of
insecurity and build new spheres of cooperation. To that end, strengthening bilateral and multilateral

* 40 *

III. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS

cooperation cannot be accomplished simply by working inside formal institutions and frameworks. It
requires sustained outreach to foreign governments, political leaderships, and other critical constituen-
cies that must commit the necessary capabilities and resources to enable effective, collective action. And
it means building upon our traditional alliances, while also cultivating partnerships with new centers of
influence. Taken together, these approaches will allow us to foster more effective global cooperation to
confront challenges that know no borders and affect every nation.

Ensure Strong Alliances

The foundation of United States, regional, and global security will remain America’s relations with our
allies, and our commitment to their security is unshakable. These relationships must be constantly
cultivated, not just because they are indispensible for U.S. interests and national security objectives,
but because they are fundamental to our collective security. Alliances are force multipliers: through
multinational cooperation and coordination, the sum of our actions is always greater than if we act
alone. We will continue to maintain the capacity to defend our allies against old and new threats. We will
also continue to closely consult with our allies as well as newly emerging partners and organizations so
that we revitalize and expand our cooperation to achieve common objectives. And we will continue to
mutually benefit from the collective security provided by strong alliances.

Although the United States and our allies and partners may sometimes disagree on specific issues, we
will act based upon mutual respect and in a manner that continues to strengthen an international order
that benefits all responsible international actors.

Strengthening Security Relationships: Our ability to sustain these alliances, and to build coalitions
of support toward common objectives, depends in part on the capabilities of America’s Armed Forces.
Similarly, the relationships our Armed Forces have developed with foreign militaries are a critical com-
ponent of our global engagement and support our collective security.

We will continue to ensure that we can prevail against a wide range of potential adversaries—to include
hostile states and nonstate actors—while broadly shaping the strategic environment using all tools to
advance our common security. We will continue to reassure our allies and partners by retaining our abil-
ity to bring precise, sustained, and effective capabilities to bear against a wide range of military threats
and decisively defeat the forces of hostile regional powers. We will work with our allies and partners
to enhance the resilience of U.S. forward posture and facilities against potential attacks. Finally, we will
strengthen our regional deterrence postures—for example, through phased, adaptive missile defense
architectures—in order to make certain that regional adversaries gain no advantages from their acquisi-
tion of new, offensive military capabilities.

European Allies: Our relationship with our European allies remains the cornerstone for U.S. engage-
ment with the world, and a catalyst for international action. We will engage with our allies bilaterally,
and pursue close consultation on a broad range of security and economic issues. The North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) is the pre-eminent security alliance in the world today. With our 27 NATO
allies, and the many partners with which NATO cooperates, we will strengthen our collective ability to
promote security, deter vital threats, and defend our people. NATO's new Strategic Concept will provide
an opportunity to revitalize and reform the Alliance. We are committed to ensuring that NATO is able to

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

address the full range of 21st century challenges, while serving as a foundation of European security. And
we will continue to anchor our commitment in Article V, which is fundamental to our collective security.

Building on European aspirations for greater integration, we are committed to partnering with a stronger
European Union to advance our shared goals, especially in promoting democracy and prosperity in
Eastern European countries that are still completing their democratic transition and in responding to
pressing issues of mutual concern. We will remain dedicated to advancing stability and democracy in
the Balkans and to resolving conflicts in the Caucasus and in Cyprus. We will continue to engage with
Turkey on a broad range of mutual goals, especially with regard to pursuit of stability in its region. And
we will seek to strengthen existing European institutions so that they are more inclusive and more
effective in building confidence, reducing tensions, and protecting freedom.

Asian Allies: Our alliances with Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand are the
bedrock of security in Asia and a foundation of prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. We will continue to
deepen and update these alliances to reflect the dynamism of the region and strategic trends of the 21st
century. Japan and South Korea are increasingly important leaders in addressing regional and global
issues, as well as in embodying and promoting our common democratic values. We are modernizing our
security relationships with both countries to face evolving 21st century global security challenges and
to reflect the principle of equal partnership with the United States and to ensure a sustainable founda-
tion for the U.S. military presence there. We are working together with our allies to develop a positive
security agenda for the region, focused on regional security, combating the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction, terrorism, climate change, international piracy, epidemics, and cybersecurity, while
achieving balanced growth and human rights.

In partnership with our allies, the United States is helping to offer a future of security and integration
to all Asian nations and to uphold and extend fundamental rights and dignity to all of its people. These
alliances have preserved a hard-earned peace and strengthened the bridges of understanding across the
Pacific Ocean in the second half of the 20th century, and it is essential to U.S., Asian, and global security
that they are as dynamic and effective in the 21st century.

North America: The strategic partnerships and unique relationships we maintain with Canada and
Mexico are critical to U.S. national security and have a direct effect on the security of our homeland. With
billions of dollars in trade, shared critical infrastructure, and millions of our citizens moving across our
common borders, no two countries are more directly connected to our daily lives. We must change the
way we think about our shared borders, in order to secure and expedite the lawful and legitimate flow
of people and goods while interdicting transnational threat that threaten our open societies.

Canada is our closest trading partner, a steadfast security ally, and an important partner in regional
and global efforts. Our mutual prosperity is closely interconnected, including through our trade rela-
tionship with Mexico through NAFTA. With Canada, our security cooperation includes our defense of
North America and our efforts through NATO overseas. And our cooperation is critical to the success of
international efforts on issues ranging from international climate negotiations to economic cooperation
through the G-20.

With Mexico, in addition to trade cooperation, we are working together to identify and interdict threats
at the earliest opportunity, even before they reach North America. Stability and security in Mexico are

* 42 *

indispensable to building a strong economic partnership, fighting the illicit drug and arms trade, and
promoting sound immigration policy.

Build Cooperation with Other 21st Century Centers of Influence

The United States is part of a dynamic international environment, in which different nations are exerting
greater influence, and advancing our interests will require expanding spheres of cooperation around the
word. Certain bilateral relationships—such as U.S. relations with China, India, and Russia—will be critical
to building broader cooperation on areas of mutual interest. And emerging powers in every region of the
world are increasingly asserting themselves, raising opportunities for partnership for the United States.

Asia: Asia’s dramatic economic growth has increased its connection to America’s future prosperity, and
its emerging centers of influence make it increasingly important. We have taken substantial steps to
deepen our engagement in the region, through regional organizations, new dialogues, and high-level
diplomacy. The United States has deep and enduring ties with the countries of the region, including
trade and investment that drive growth and prosperity on both sides of the Pacific, and enhancing these
ties is critical to our efforts to advance balanced and sustainable growth and to doubling U.S. exports.
We have increasing security cooperation on issues such as violent extremism and nuclear proliferation.
We will work to advance these mutual interests through our alliances, deepen our relationships with
emerging powers, and pursue a stronger role in the region's multilateral architecture, including the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the
Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the East Asia Summit.

We will continue to pursue a positive, constructive, and comprehensive relationship with China. We
welcome a China that takes on a responsible leadership role in working with the United States and the
international community to advance priorities like economic recovery, confronting climate change, and
nonproliferation. We will monitor China's military modernization program and prepare accordingly to
ensure that U.S. interests and allies, regionally and globally, are not negatively affected. More broadly,
we will encourage China to make choices that contribute to peace, security, and prosperity as its influ-
ence rises. We are using our newly established Strategic and Economic Dialogue to address a broader
range of issues, and improve communication between our militaries in order to reduce mistrust. We
will encourage continued reduction in tension between the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan. We
will not agree on every issue, and we will be candid on our human rights concerns and areas where
we differ. But disagreements should not prevent cooperation on issues of mutual interest, because a
pragmatic and effective relationship between the United States and China is essential to address the
major challenges of the 21st century.

The United States and India are building a strategic partnership that is underpinned by our shared
interests, our shared values as the world’s two largest democracies, and close connections among our
people. India’s responsible advancement serves as a positive example for developing nations, and
provides an opportunity for increased economic, scientific, environmental, and security partnership.
Working together through our Strategic Dialogue and high-level visits, we seek a broad-based relation-
ship in which India contributes to global counterterrorism efforts, nonproliferation, and helps promote
poverty-reduction, education, health, and sustainable agriculture. We value India’s growing leadership

* 43

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

on a wide array of global issues, through groups such as the G-20, and will seek to work with India to
promote stability in South Asia and elsewhere in the world.

Russia: We seek to build a stable, substantive, multidimensional relationship with Russia, based on
mutual interests. The United States has an interest in a strong, peaceful, and prosperous Russia that
respects international norms. As the two nations possessing the majority of the world’s nuclear weap-
ons, we are working together to advance nonproliferation, both by reducing our nuclear arsenals and
by cooperating to ensure that other countries meet their international commitments to reducing the
spread of nuclear weapons around the world. We will seek greater partnership with Russia in confronting
violent extremism, especially in Afghanistan. We also will seek new trade and investment arrangements
for increasing the prosperity of our peoples. We support efforts within Russia to promote the rule of
law, accountable government, and universal values. While actively seeking Russia’s cooperation to act
as a responsible partner in Europe and Asia, we will support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Russia's neighbors.

Emerging Centers of Influence: Due to increased economic growth and political stability, individual
nations are increasingly taking on powerful regional and global roles and changing the landscape of
international cooperation. To achieve a just and sustainable order that advances our shared security and
prosperity, we are, therefore, deepening our partnerships with emerging powers and encouraging them
to play a greater role in strengthening international norms and advancing shared interests.

The rise of the G-20, for example, as the premier international economic forum, represents a distinct shift
in our global international order toward greater cooperation between traditional major economies and
emerging centers of influence. The nations composing the G-20—from South Korea to South Africa,
Saudi Arabia to Argentina—represent at least 80 percent of global gross national product, making it an
influential body on the world stage. Stabilizing our global economy, increasing energy efficiency around
the globe, and addressing chronic hunger in poor countries are only three examples of the broad global
challenges that cannot be solved by a few countries alone.

Indonesia—as the world’s fourth most populous country, a member of the G-20, and a democracy—will
become an increasingly important partner on regional and transnational issues such as climate change,
counterterrorism, maritime security, peacekeeping, and disaster relief. With tolerance, resilience, and
multiculturalism as core values, and a flourishing civil society, Indonesia is uniquely positioned to help
address challenges facing the developing world.

In the Americas, we are bound by proximity, integrated markets, energy interdependence, a broadly
shared commitment to democracy, and the rule of law. Our deep historical, familial, and cultural ties
make our alliances and partnerships critical to U.S. interests. We will work in equal partnership to advance
economic and social inclusion, safeguard citizen safety and security, promote clean energy, and defend
universal values of the people of the hemisphere.

We welcome Brazil's leadership and seek to move beyond dated North-South divisions to pursue
progress on bilateral, hemispheric, and global issues. Brazil’s macroeconomic success, coupled with its
steps to narrow socioeconomic gaps, provide important lessons for countries throughout the Americas
and Africa. We will encourage Brazilian efforts against illicit transnational networks. As guardian of a
unique national environmental patrimony and a leader in renewable fuels, Brazil is an important partner

* AA k

III. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS

in confronting global climate change and promoting energy security. And in the context of the G-20
and the Doha round, we will work with Brazil to ensure that economic development and prosperity is
broadly shared.

We have an array of enduring interests, longstanding commitments and new opportunities for broaden-
ing and deepening relationships in the greater Middle East. This includes maintaining a strong partner-
ship with Israel while supporting Israel's lasting integration into the region. The U.S. also will continue
to develop our key security relationships in the region with such Arab states as with Egypt, Jordan,
and Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries—partnerships that enable our
militaries and defense systems to work together more effectively.

We have a strategic interest in ensuring that the social and economic needs and political rights of people
in this region, who represent one of the world’s youngest populations, are met. We will continue to
press governments in the region to undertake political reforms and to loosen restrictions on speech,
assembly and media. We will maintain our strong support for civil society groups and those individuals
who stand up for universal rights. And we will continue to foster partnerships in areas like education,
economic growth, science, and health to help expand opportunity. On a multilateral basis, we seek to
advance shared security interests, such as through NATO's Istanbul Cooperation Initiative with the GCC,
and common interests in promoting governance and institutional reform through participating in the
Forum for the Future and other regional dialogues.

The diversity and complexity of the African continent offer the United States opportunities and chal-
lenges. As African states grow their economies and strengthen their democratic institutions and gov-
ernance, America will continue to embrace effective partnerships. Our economic, security, and political
cooperation will be consultative and encompass global, regional, and national priorities including access
to open markets, conflict prevention, global peacekeeping, counterterrorism, and the protection of vital
carbon sinks. The Administration will refocus its priorities on strategic interventions that can promote job
creation and economic growth; combat corruption while strengthening good governance and account-
ability; responsibly improve the capacity of African security and rule of law sectors; and work through
diplomatic dialogue to mitigate local and regional tensions before they become crises. We will also
reinforce sustainable stability in key states like Nigeria and Kenya that are essential subregional linchpins.

The United States will work to remain an attractive and influential partner by ensuring that African
priorities such as infrastructure development, improving reliable access to power, and increased trade
and investment remain high on our agenda. South Africa's inclusion in the G-20 should be followed by a
growing number of emerging African nations who are charting a course toward improved governance
and meaningful development. South Africa’s vibrant democracy, combined with its regional and global
leadership roles, is a critical partner. From peacemaking to climate change to capacity-building, South
Africa brings unique value and perspective to international initiatives. With its strong, diversified, well-
managed economy, it often serves as a springboard to the entire African continent, and we will work
to pursue shared interests in Africa's security, growth, and the development of Africa's human capital.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

Strengthen Institutions and Mechanisms for Cooperation

Just as U.S. foresight and leadership were essential to forging the architecture for international coopera-
tion after World War Il, we must again lead global efforts to modernize the infrastructure for international
cooperation in the 21st century. Indeed, our ability to advance peace, security, and opportunity will
turn on our ability to strengthen both our national and our multilateral capabilities. To solve problems,
we will pursue modes of cooperation that reflect evolving distributions of power and responsibility.
We need to assist existing institutions to perform effectively. When they come up short, we must seek
meaningful changes and develop alternative mechanisms.

Enhance Cooperation with and Strengthen the United Nations: We are enhancing our coordination
with the U.N. and its agencies. We need a U.N. capable of fulfilling its founding purpose—maintaining
international peace and security, promoting global cooperation, and advancing human rights. To this
end, we are paying our bills. We are intensifying efforts with partners on and outside the U.N. Security
Council to ensure timely, robust, and credible Council action to address threats to peace and security. We
favor Security Council reform that enhances the U.N‘s overall performance, credibility, and legitimacy.
Across the broader U.N. system we support reforms that promote effective and efficient leadership and
management of the U.N’s international civil service, and we are working with U.N. personnel and mem-
ber states to strengthen the U.N’s leadership and operational capacity in peacekeeping, humanitarian
relief, post-disaster recovery, development assistance, and the promotion of human rights. And we are
supporting new U.N. frameworks and capacities for combating transnational threats like proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction, infectious disease, drug-trafficking, and counterterrorism.

Pursue Decisions though a Wide Range of Frameworks and Coalitions: We need to spur and harness a
new diversity of instruments, alliances, and institutions in which a division of labor emerges on the basis
of effectiveness, competency, and long-term reliability. This requires enhanced coordination among
the United Nations, regional organizations, international financial institutions, specialized agencies,
and other actors that are better placed or equipped to manage certain threats and challenges. We are
attempting to forge new agreement on common global challenges among the world’s leading and
emerging powers to ensure that multilateral cooperation reflects the sustained commitment of influen-
tial countries. While we are pursuing G-8 initiatives with proven and long-standing partners, have begun
to shift the focus of our economic coordination to the G-20, which is more reflective of today’s diffusion
of power and the need to enlist the efforts of a broader spectrum of countries across Asia to Europe,
Africa to the Middle East, and our neighbors in the Americas. We are also renewing U.S. leadership in
the multilateral development banks and the IMF, and leveraging our engagement and investments in
these institutions to strengthen the global economy, lift people out of poverty, advance food security,
address climate and pandemics, and secure fragile states such as Afghanistan and Haiti.

Invest in Regional Capabilities: Regional organizations can be particularly effective at mobilizing and
legitimating cooperation among countries closest to the problem. Regional organizations—whether
NATO, the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe, the Organization of the Islamic Conference,
the African Union, Organization of American States, or ASEAN, and the Gulf Cooperation Council—vary
widely in their membership, constitutions, histories, orientation, and operational capabilities. That variety
needs to inform a strategic approach to their evolving roles and relative contributions to global security.

* 46 *

III. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS

The United States is encouraging continued innovation and development of enhanced regional capabili-
ties in the context of an evolving division of labor among local, national, and global institutions that seeks
to leverage relative capacities. Where appropriate, we use training and related programs to strengthen
regional capacities for peacekeeping and conflict management to improve impact and share burdens.
We will also encourage a more comprehensive approach to regional security that brings balanced focus
to issues such as food security, global health, and education; access to more affordable and greener
forms of energy; access to fair and efficient justice; and a concerted effort to promote transparency at
all levels and to fight the corrosive effect of corruption.

Sustain Broad Cooperation on Key Global Challenges

Many of today’s challenges cannot be solved by one nation or even a group of nations. The test of our
international order, therefore, will be its ability to facilitate the broad and effective global cooperation
necessary to meet 21st century challenges. Many of these challenges have been discussed previously,
including violent extremism, nuclear proliferation, and promotion of global prosperity. In addition, other
key challenges requiring broad global cooperation include:

Climate Change: The danger from climate change is real, urgent, and severe. The change wrought by a
warming planet will lead to new conflicts over refugees and resources; new suffering from drought and
famine; catastrophic natural disasters; and the degradation of land across the globe. The United States
will therefore confront climate change based upon clear guidance from the science, and in cooperation
with all nations—for there is no effective solution to climate change that does not depend upon all
nations taking responsibility for their own actions and for the planet we will leave behind.

e Home: Our effort begins with the steps that we are taking at home. We will stimulate our energy
economy at home, reinvigorate the U.S. domestic nuclear industry, increase our efficiency
standards, invest in renewable energy, and provide the incentives that make clean energy the
profitable kind of energy. This will allow us to make deep cuts in emissions—in the range of 17
percent by 2020 and more than 80 percent by 2050. This will depend in part upon comprehen-
sive legislation and its effective implementation.

e Abroad: Regionally, we will build on efforts in Asia, the Americas, and Africa to forge new clean
energy partnerships. Globally, we will seek to implement and build on the Copenhagen Accord,
and ensure a response to climate change that draws upon decisive action by all nations. Our goal
is an effective, international effort in which all major economies commit to ambitious national
action to reduce their emissions, nations meet their commitments in a transparent manner, and
the necessary financing is mobilized so that developing countries can adapt to climate change,
mitigate its impacts, conserve forests, and invest in clean energy technologies. We will pursue
this global cooperation through multiple avenues, with a focus on advancing cooperation
that works. We accept the principle of common but differentiated responses and respective
capabilities, but will insist that any approach draws upon each nation taking responsibility for
its own actions.

Peacekeeping and Armed Conflict: The untold loss of human life, suffering, and property damage that
results from armed conflict necessitates that all responsible nations work to prevent it. No single nation

* 47 &

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

can or should shoulder the burden for managing or resolving the world’s armed conflicts. To this end,
we will place renewed emphasis on deterrence and prevention by mobilizing diplomatic action, and
use development and security sector assistance to build the capacity of at-risk nations and reduce
the appeal of violent extremism. But when international forces are needed to respond to threats and
keep the peace, we will work with international partners to ensure they are ready, able, and willing. We
will continue to build support in other countries to contribute to sustaining global peace and stability
operations, through U.N. peacekeeping and regional organizations, such as NATO and the African Union.
We will continue to broaden the pool of troop and police contributors, working to ensure that they are
properly trained and equipped, that their mandates are matched to means, and that their missions are
backed by the political action necessary to build and sustain peace.

In Sudan, which has been marred by violent conflict for decades, the United States remains committed
to working with the international community to support implementation of outstanding elements of
the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and ensure that the referendum on the future of Southern Sudan
in 2011 happens on time and that its results are respected. In addition, we will continue to engage in the
efforts necessary to support peace and stability after the referendum, and continue to work to secure
peace, dignity, and accountability in Darfur.

e Prevent Genocide and Mass Atrocities: The United States and all member states of the U.N.
have endorsed the concept of the “Responsibility to Protect.’ In so doing, we have recognized
that the primary responsibility for preventing genocide and mass atrocity rests with sovereign
governments, but that this responsibility passes to the broader international community when
sovereign governments themselves commit genocide or mass atrocities, or when they prove
unable or unwilling to take necessary action to prevent or respond to such crimes inside their
borders. The United States is committed to working with our allies, and to strengthening our
own internal capabilities, in order to ensure that the United States and the international com-
munity are proactively engaged in a strategic effort to prevent mass atrocities and genocide.
In the event that prevention fails, the United States will work both multilaterally and bilaterally
to mobilize diplomatic, humanitarian, financial, and—in certain instances—military means to
prevent and respond to genocide and mass atrocities.

e International Justice: From Nuremberg to Yugoslavia to Liberia, the United States has seen
that the end of impunity and the promotion of justice are not just moral imperatives; they
are stabilizing forces in international affairs. The United States is thus working to strengthen
national justice systems and is maintaining our support for ad hoc international tribunals and
hybrid courts. Those who intentionally target innocent civilians must be held accountable, and
we will continue to support institutions and prosecutions that advance this important interest.
Although the United States is not at present a party to the Rome Statute of the International
Criminal Court (ICC), and will always protect U.S. personnel, we are engaging with State Parties
to the Rome Statute on issues of concern and are supporting the ICC's prosecution of those cases
that advance U.S. interests and values, consistent with the requirements of U.S. law.

Pandemics and Infectious Disease: The threat of contagious disease transcends political boundaries, and
the ability to prevent, quickly detect and contain outbreaks with pandemic potential has never been so

* 48 &

III. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS

important. An epidemic that begins in a single community can quickly evolve into a multinational health
crisis that causes millions to suffer, as well as spark major disruptions to travel and trade. Addressing these
transnational risks requires advance preparation, extensive collaboration with the global community,
and the development of a resilient population at home.

Recognizing that the health of the world’s population has never been more interdependent, we
are improving our public health and medical capabilities on the front lines, including domestic and
international disease surveillance, situational awareness, rapid and reliable development of medical
countermeasures to respond to public health threats, preparedness education and training, and surge
capacity of the domestic health care system to respond to an influx of patients due to a disaster or
emergency. These capabilities include our ability to work with international partners to mitigate and
contain disease when necessary.

We are enhancing international collaboration and strengthening multilateral institutions in order to
improve global surveillance and early warning capabilities and quickly enact control and containment
measures against the next pandemic threat. We continue to improve our understanding of emerging
diseases and help develop environments that are less conducive to epidemic emergence. We depend
on U.S. overseas laboratories, relationships with host nation governments, and the willingness of states
to share health data with nongovernmental and international organizations. In this regard, we need to
continue to work to overcome the lack of openness and a general reluctance to share health information.
Finally, we seek to mitigate other problem areas, including limited global vaccine production capacity,
and the threat of emergent and reemergent disease in poorly governed states.

Transnational Criminal Threats and Threats to Governance: Transnational criminal threats and illicit
trafficking networks continue to expand dramatically in size, scope, and influence—posing significant
national security challenges for the United States and our partner countries. These threats cross borders
and continents and undermine the stability of nations, subverting government institutions through
corruption and harming citizens worldwide. Transnational criminal organizations have accumulated
unprecedented wealth and power through trafficking and other illicit activities, penetrating legitimate
financial systems and destabilizing commercial markets. They extend their reach by forming alliances
with government officials and some state security services. The crime-terror nexus is a serious concern
as terrorists use criminal networks for logistical support and funding. Increasingly, these networks are
involved in cyber crime, which cost consumers billions of dollars annually, while undermining global
confidence in the international financial system.

Combating transnational criminal and trafficking networks requires a multidimensional strategy that
safeguards citizens, breaks the financial strength of criminal and terrorist networks, disrupts illicit traffick-
ing networks, defeats transnational criminal organizations, fights government corruption, strengthens
the rule of law, bolsters judicial systems, and improves transparency. While these are major challenges,
the United States will be able to devise and execute a collective strategy with other nations facing the
same threats.

Safeguarding the Global Commons: Across the globe, we must work in concert with allies and partners
to optimize the use of shared sea, air, and space domains. These shared areas, which exist outside exclu-
sive national jurisdictions, are the connective tissue around our globe upon which all nations’ security

* 49 &

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

and prosperity depend. The United States will continue to help safeguard access, promote security,
and ensure the sustainable use of resources in these domains. These efforts require strong multilateral
cooperation, enhanced domain awareness and monitoring, and the strengthening of international
norms and standards.

We must work together to ensure the constant flow of commerce, facilitate safe and secure air travel,
and prevent disruptions to critical communications. We must also safeguard the sea, air, and space
domains from those who would deny access or use them for hostile purposes. This includes keeping
strategic straits and vital sea lanes open, improving the early detection of emerging maritime threats,
denying adversaries hostile use of the air domain, and ensuring the responsible use of space. As one
key effort in the sea domain, for example, we will pursue ratification of the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea.

Many of these goals are equally applicable to cyberspace. While cyberspace relies on the digital infra-
structure of individual countries, such infrastructure is globally connected, and securing it requires global
cooperation. We will push for the recognition of norms of behavior in cyberspace, and otherwise work
with global partners to ensure the protection of the free flow of information and our continued access.
At all times, we will continue to defend our digital networks from intrusion and harmful disruption.

Arctic Interests: The United States is an Arctic Nation with broad and fundamental interests in the Arctic
region, where we seek to meet our national security needs, protect the environment, responsibly
manage resources, account for indigenous communities, support scientific research, and strengthen
international cooperation on a wide range of issues.

IV. Conclusion

“It’s easy to forget that, when this war began, we were united, bound together by the
fresh memory of a horrific attack and by the determination to defend our homeland
and the values we hold dear. I refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that
unity again. I believe with every fiber of my being that we, as Americans, can still come
together behind a common purpose, for our values are not simply words written into
parchment. They are a creed that calls us together and that has carried us through the
darkest of storms as one nation, as one people.”

—President Barack Obama, West Point, New York, December 2, 2009

This strategy calls for a comprehensive range of national actions, and a broad conception of what con-
stitutes our national security. Above all, it is about renewing our leadership by calling upon what is best
about America—our innovation and capacity; our openness and moral imagination.

Success will require approaches that can be sustained and achieve results. One of the reasons that this
nation succeeded in the second half of the 20th century was its capacity to pursue policies and build
institutions that endured across multiple Administrations, while also preserving the flexibility to endure
setbacks and to make necessary adjustments. In some instances, the United States has been able to
carry forward this example in the years since the Cold War. But there are also many open questions,
unfinished reforms, and deep divisions—at home and abroad—that constrain our ability to advance
our interests and renew our leadership.

To effectively craft and implement a sustainable, results-oriented national security strategy, there must
be effective cooperation between the branches of government. This Administration believes that we
are strong when we act in line with our laws, as the Constitution itself demands. This Administration is
also committed to active consultation with Congress, and welcomes robust and effective oversight of its
national security policies. We welcome Congress as a full partner in forging durable solutions to tough
challenges, looking beyond the headlines to take a long view of America’s interests. And we encour-
age Congress to pursue oversight in line with the reforms that have been enacted through legislation,
particularly in the years since 9/11.

The executive branch must do its part by developing integrated plans and approaches that leverage
the capabilities across its departments and agencies to deal with the issues we confront. Collaboration
across the government—and with our partners at the state, local, and tribal levels of government, in
industry, and abroad—must guide our actions.

This kind of effective cooperation will depend upon broad and bipartisan cooperation. Throughout the
Cold War, even as there were intense disagreements about certain courses of action, there remained a
belief that America’s political leaders shared common goals, even if they differed about how to reach
them. In today’s political environment, due to the actions of both parties that sense of common purpose
is at times lacking in our national security dialogue. This division places the United States at a strategic

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

disadvantage. It sets back our ability to deal with difficult challenges and injects a sense of anxiety
and polarization into our politics that can affect our policies and our posture around the world. It must
be replaced by a renewed sense of civility and a commitment to embrace our common purpose as
Americans.

Americans are by nature a confident and optimistic people. We would not have achieved our position of
leadership in the world without the extraordinary strength of our founding documents and the capability
and courage of generations of Americans who gave life to those values—through their service, through
their sacrifices, through their aspirations, and through their pursuit of a more perfect union. We see those
same qualities today, particularly in our young men and women in uniform who have served tour after
tour of duty to defend our nation in harm’s way, and their civilian counterparts.

This responsibility cannot be theirs alone. And there is no question that we, as a nation, can meet our
responsibility as Americans once more. Even in a world of enormous challenges, no threat is bigger than
the American peoples’ capacity to meet it, and no opportunity exceeds our reach. We continue to draw
strength from those founding documents that established the creed that binds us together. We, too,
can demonstrate the capability and courage to pursue a more perfect union and—in doing so—renew
American leadership in the world.

THE WHITE HOUSE

WASHINGTON

Today, the United States is stronger and better positioned to seize the opportunities of a still new century
and safeguard our interests against the risks of an insecure world.

America’s growing economic strength is the foundation of our national security and a critical source
of our influence abroad. Since the Great Recession, we have created nearly 11 million new jobs during
the longest private sector job growth in our history. Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in 6
years. We are now the world leader in oil and gas production. We continue to set the pace for science,
technology, and innovation in the global economy.

We also benefit from a young and growing workforce, and a resilient and diversified economy. The
entrepreneurial spirit of our workers and businesses undergirds our economic edge. Our higher education
system is the finest in the world, drawing more of the best students globally every year. We continue

to attract immigrants from every corner of the world who renew our country with their energy and
entrepreneurial talents.

Globally, we have moved beyond the large ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that defined so much of
American foreign policy over the past decade. Compared to the nearly 180,000 troops we had in Iraq and
Afghanistan when I took office, we now have fewer than 15,000 deployed in those countries. We possess
a military whose might, technology, and geostrategic reach is unrivaled in human history. We have
renewed our alliances from Europe to Asia.

Now, at this pivotal moment, we continue to face serious challenges to our national security, even as

we are working to shape the opportunities of tomorrow. Violent extremism and an evolving terrorist
threat raise a persistent risk of attacks on America and our allies. Escalating challenges to cybersecurity,
aggression by Russia, the accelerating impacts of climate change, and the outbreak of infectious diseases
all give rise to anxieties about global security. We must be clear-eyed about these and other challenges
and recognize the United States has a unique capability to mobilize and lead the international community
to meet them.

Any successful strategy to ensure the safety of the American people and advance our national security
interests must begin with an undeniable truth—America must lead. Strong and sustained American
leadership is essential to a rules-based international order that promotes global security and prosperity as
well as the dignity and human rights of all peoples. The question is never whether America should lead,
but how we lead.

Abroad, we are demonstrating that while we will act unilaterally against threats to our core interests, we
are stronger when we mobilize collective action. That is why we are leading international coalitions to
confront the acute challenges posed by aggression, terrorism, and disease. We are leading over 60 partners
in a global campaign to degrade and ultimately defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)

in Iraq and Syria, including by working to disrupt the flow of foreign fighters to those countries, while
keeping pressure on al-Qa’ida. We are leading a global effort to stop the deadly spread of the Ebola virus
at its source. In lockstep with our European allies, we are enforcing tough sanctions on Russia to impose
costs and deter future aggression.

Even as we meet these pressing challenges, we are pursuing historic opportunities. Our rebalance to Asia
and the Pacific is yielding deeper ties with a more diverse set of allies and partners. When complete, the
Trans-Pacific Partnership will generate trade and investment opportunities—and create high-quality jobs
at home—across a region that represents more than 40 percent of global trade. We are primed to unlock
the potential of our relationship with India. The scope of our cooperation with China is unprecedented,
even as we remain alert to China’s military modernization and reject any role for intimidation in resolving

territorial disputes. We are deepening our investment in Africa, accelerating access to energy, health, and
food security in a rapidly rising region. Our opening to Cuba will enhance our engagement in our own
hemisphere, where there are enormous opportunities to consolidate gains in pursuit of peace, prosperity,
democracy, and energy security.

Globally, we are committed to advancing the Prague Agenda, including by stopping the spread of nuclear
weapons and securing nuclear materials. We are currently testing whether it is possible to achieve a
comprehensive resolution to assure the international community that Iran’s nuclear program is peaceful,
while the Joint Plan of Action has halted the progress of Iran’s program. We are building on our own
energy security—and the ground-breaking commitment we made with China to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions—to cement an international consensus on arresting climate change. We are shaping global
standards for cybersecurity and building international capacity to disrupt and investigate cyber threats.
We are playing a leading role in defining the international community’s post-2015 agenda for eliminating
extreme poverty and promoting sustainable development while prioritizing women and youth.

Underpinning it all, we are upholding our enduring commitment to the advancement of democracy and
human rights and building new coalitions to combat corruption and to support open governments and
open societies. In doing so, we are working to support democratic transitions, while also reaching out to
the drivers of change in this century: young people and entrepreneurs.

Finally, I believe that America leads best when we draw upon our hopes rather than our fears. To succeed,
we must draw upon the power of our example—that means viewing our commitment to our values and
the rule of law as a strength, and not an inconvenience. That is why I have worked to ensure that America
has the capabilities we need to respond to threats abroad, while acting in line with our values—prohibiting
the use of torture; embracing constraints on our use of new technologies like drones; and upholding our
commitment to privacy and civil liberties. These actions are a part of our resilience at home and a source
of our influence abroad.

On all these fronts, America leads from a position of strength. But, this does not mean we can or should
attempt to dictate the trajectory of all unfolding events around the world. As powerful as we are and

will remain, our resources and influence are not infinite. And in a complex world, many of the security
problems we face do not lend themselves to quick and easy fixes. The United States will always defend
our interests and uphold our commitments to allies and partners. But, we have to make hard choices
among many competing priorities, and we must always resist the over-reach that comes when we make
decisions based upon fear. Moreover, we must recognize that a smart national security strategy does not
rely solely on military power. Indeed, in the long-term, our efforts to work with other countries to counter
the ideology and root causes of violent extremism will be more important than our capacity to remove
terrorists from the battlefield.

The challenges we face require strategic patience and persistence. They require us to take our
responsibilities seriously and make the smart investments in the foundations of our national power.
Therefore, I will continue to pursue a comprehensive agenda that draws on all elements of our national
strength, that is attuned to the strategic risks and opportunities we face, and that is guided by the
principles and priorities set out in this strategy. Moreover, I will continue to insist on budgets that
safeguard our strength and work with the Congress to end sequestration, which undercuts our national
security.

This is an ambitious agenda, and not everything will be completed during my Presidency. But I believe
this is an achievable agenda, especially if we proceed with confidence and if we restore the bipartisan
center that has been a pillar of strength for American foreign policy in decades past. As Americans,

we will always have our differences, but what unites us is the national consensus that American global
leadership remains indispensable. We embrace our exceptional role and responsibilities at a time when
our unique contributions and capabilities are needed most, and when the choices we make today can mean
greater security and prosperity for our Nation for decades to come.

I. Introduction

In ayoung century, opportunities for America abound, but risks to our security remain. This new National
Security Strategy positions the United States to safeguard our national interests through strong and
sustainable leadership. It sets out the principles and priorities to guide the use of American power and
influence in the world. It advances a model of American leadership rooted in the foundation of America’s
economic and technological strength and the values of the American people. It redoubles our commit-
ment to allies and partners and welcomes the constructive contributions of responsible rising powers.
It signals our resolve and readiness to deter and, if necessary, defeat potential adversaries. It affirms
America’s leadership role within a rules-based international order that works best through empowered
citizens, responsible states, and effective regional and international organizations. And it serves as a
compass for how this Administration, in partnership with the Congress, will lead the world through a
shifting security landscape toward a more durable peace and a new prosperity.

This strategy builds on the progress of the last 6 years, in which our active leadership has helped the
world recover from a global economic crisis and respond to an array of emerging challenges. Our
progress includes strengthening an unrivaled alliance system, underpinned by our enduring partner-
ship with Europe, while investing in nascent multilateral forums like the G-20 and East Asia Summit.
We brought most of our troops home after more than a decade of honorable service in two wars
while adapting our counterterrorism strategy for an evolving terrorist threat. We led a multinational
coalition to support the Afghan government to take responsibility for the security of their country,
while supporting Afghanistan's first peaceful, democratic transition of power. The United States led
the international response to natural disasters, including the earthquake in Haiti, the earthquake and
tsunami in Japan, and the typhoon in the Philippines to save lives, prevent greater damage, and support
efforts to rebuild. We led international efforts to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons, including by
building an unprecedented international sanctions regime to hold Iran responsible for failing to meet
its international obligations, while pursuing a diplomatic effort that has already stopped the progress
of lran’s nuclear program and rolled it back in key respects. We are rebalancing toward Asia and the
Pacific while seeking new opportunities for partnership and investment in Africa and the Americas,
where we have spurred greater agriculture and energy-related investments than ever before. And at
home and abroad, we are taking concerted action to confront the dangers posed by climate change
and to strengthen our energy security.

Still, there is no shortage of challenges that demand continued American leadership. The potential
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, poses a grave risk. Even as
we have decimated al-Qa’ida’s core leadership, more diffuse networks of al-Qa’ida, ISIL, and affiliated
groups threaten U.S. citizens, interests, allies, and partners. Violent extremists exploit upheaval across the
Middle East and North Africa. Fragile and conflict-affected states incubate and spawn infectious disease,
illicit weapons and drug smugglers, and destabilizing refugee flows. Too often, failures in governance
and endemic corruption hold back the potential of rising regions. The danger of disruptive and even
destructive cyber-attack is growing, and the risk of another global economic slowdown remains. The
international community's ability to respond effectively to these and other risks is helped or hindered by

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

the behaviors of major powers. Where progress has been most profound, it is due to the steadfastness
of our allies and the cooperation of other emerging powers.

These complex times have made clear the power and centrality of America’s indispensable leadership
in the world. We mobilized and are leading global efforts to impose costs to counter Russian aggres-
sion, to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL, to squelch the Ebola virus at its source, to stop the spread
of nuclear weapons materials, and to turn the corner on global carbon emissions. A strong consensus
endures across our political spectrum that the question is not whether America will lead, but how we
will lead into the future.

First and foremost, we will lead with purpose. American leadership is a global force for good, but it is
grounded in our enduring national interests as outlined in the 2010 National Security Strategy:

e The security of the United States, its citizens, and U.S. allies and partners;

e Astrong, innovative, and growing U.S. economy in an open international economic system that
promotes opportunity and prosperity;

e Respect for universal values at home and around the world; and

e Arules-based international order advanced by U.S. leadership that promotes peace, security,
and opportunity through stronger cooperation to meet global challenges.

Especially in a changing global environment, these national interests will continue to guide all we do
in the world. To advance these interests most effectively, we must pursue a comprehensive national
security agenda, allocate resources accordingly, and work with the Congress to end sequestration. Even
so, our resources will never be limitless. Policy tradeoffs and hard choices will need to be made. In such
instances, we will prioritize efforts that address the top strategic risks to our interests:

e Catastrophic attack on the U.S. homeland or critical infrastructure;
e Threats or attacks against U.S. citizens abroad and our allies;

e Global economic crisis or widespread economic slowdown;

e Proliferation and/or use of weapons of mass destruction;

e Severe global infectious disease outbreaks;

e Climate change;

e Major energy market disruptions; and

e Significant security consequences associated with weak or failing states (including mass atroci-
ties, regional spillover, and transnational organized crime).

We will seize strategic opportunities to shape the economic order and cultivate new relationships with
emerging economic powers and countries newly committed to peaceful democratic change. We will
also capitalize on the potential to end extreme poverty and build upon our comparative advantages in
innovation, science and technology, entrepreneurship, and greater energy security.

I. INTRODUCTION

We will lead with strength. After a difficult decade, America is growing stronger every day. The U.S.
economy remains the most dynamic and resilient on Earth. We have rebounded from a global reces-
sion by creating more jobs in the United States than in all other advanced economies combined. Our
military might is unrivaled. Yet, American exceptionalism is not rooted solely in the strength of our arms
or economy. Above all, it is the product of our founding values, including the rule of law and universal
rights, as well as the grit, talent, and diversity of the American people.

In the last 6 years alone, we arrested the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and catalyzed a
new era of economic growth. We increased our competitive edge and leadership in education, energy,
science and technology, research and development, and healthcare. We achieved an energy transforma-
tion in North America. We are fortifying our critical infrastructure against all hazards, especially cyber
espionage and attack. And we are working hard to safeguard our civil liberties while advancing our
security.

America’s strategic fundamentals are strong but should not be taken for granted. We must be innova-
tive and judicious in how we use our resources to build up our national power. Going forward, we will
strengthen our foundation by growing our economy, modernizing our defense, upholding our values,
enhancing the resilience of our homeland, and promoting talent and diversity in our national security
workforce.

We will lead by example. The strength of our institutions and our respect for the rule of law sets an
example for democratic governance. When we uphold our values at home, we are better able to promote
them in the world. This means safeguarding the civil rights and liberties of our citizens while increasing
transparency and accountability. It also means holding ourselves to international norms and standards
that we expect other nations to uphold, and admitting when we do not. We must also demonstrate our
ability to forge diverse partnerships across our political spectrum. Many achievements of recent years
were made possible by Democrats and Republicans; Federal, state and local governments; and the public
and private sectors working together. But, we face continued challenges, including political dysfunction
in Washington that undermines national unity, stifles bipartisan cooperation, and ultimately erodes the
perception and strength of our leadership abroad. American leadership is always most powerful when
we are able to forge common ground at home around key national priorities.

We will lead with capable partners. In an interconnected world, there are no global problems that can
be solved without the United States, and few that can be solved by the United States alone. American
leadership remains essential for mobilizing collective action to address global risks and seize strategic
opportunities. Our closest partners and allies will remain the cornerstone of our international engage-
ment. Yet, we will continuously expand the scope of cooperation to encompass other state partners,
non-state and private actors, and international institutions—particularly the United Nations (U.N.),
international financial institutions, and key regional organizations. These partnerships can deliver
essential capacity to share the burdens of maintaining global security and prosperity and to uphold
the norms that govern responsible international behavior. At the same time, we and our partners must
make the reforms and investments needed to make sure we can work more effectively with each other
while growing the ranks of responsible, capable states. The United States is safer and stronger when
fewer people face destitution, when our trading partners are flourishing, and when societies are freer.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

We will lead with all the instruments of U.S. power. Our influence is greatest when we combine all
our strategic advantages. Our military will remain ready to defend our enduring national interests while
providing essential leverage for our diplomacy. The use of force is not, however, the only tool at our
disposal, and it is not the principal means of U.S. engagement abroad, nor always the most effective for
the challenges we face. Rather, our first line of action is principled and clear-eyed diplomacy, combined
with the central role of development in the forward defense and promotion of America’s interests. We will
continue pursuing measures to enhance the security of our diplomats and development professionals
to ensure they can fulfill their responsibilities safely in high-risk environments. We will also leverage a
strong and well-regulated economy to promote trade and investment while protecting the international
financial system from abuse. Targeted economic sanctions will remain an effective tool for imposing costs
on irresponsible actors and helping to dismantle criminal and terrorist networks. All our tools are made
more effective by the skill of our intelligence professionals and the quality of intelligence they collect,
analyze, and produce. Finally, we will apply our distinct advantages in law enforcement, science and
technology, and people-to-people relationships to maximize the strategic effects of our national power.

We will lead with a long-term perspective. Around the world, there are historic transitions underway
that will unfold over decades. This strategy positions America to influence their trajectories, seize the
opportunities they create, and manage the risks they present. Five recent transitions, in particular, have
significantly changed the security landscape, including since our last strategy in 2010.

First, power among states is more dynamic. The increasing use of the G-20 on global economic matters
reflects an evolution in economic power, as does the rise of Asia, Latin America, and Africa. As the bal-
ance of economic power changes, so do expectations about influence over international affairs. Shifting
power dynamics create both opportunities and risks for cooperation, as some states have been more
willing than others to assume responsibilities commensurate with their greater economic capacity. In
particular, India’s potential, China’s rise, and Russia's aggression all significantly impact the future of
major power relations.

Second, power is shifting below and beyond the nation-state. Governments once able to operate with
few checks and balances are increasingly expected to be more accountable to sub-state and non-state
actors—from mayors of mega-cities and leaders in private industry to a more empowered civil society.
They are also contending with citizens enabled by technology, youth as a majority in many societies,
anda growing global middle class with higher expectations for governance and economic opportunity.
While largely positive, these trends can foster violent non-state actors and foment instability—especially
in fragile states where governance is weak or has broken down—or invite backlash by authoritarian
regimes determined to preserve the power of the state.

Third, the increasing interdependence of the global economy and rapid pace of technological change
are linking individuals, groups, and governments in unprecedented ways. This enables and incentivizes
new forms of cooperation to establish dynamic security networks, expand international trade and invest-
ment, and transform global communications. It also creates shared vulnerabilities, as interconnected
systems and sectors are susceptible to the threats of climate change, malicious cyber activity, pandemic
diseases, and transnational terrorism and crime.

I. INTRODUCTION

Fourth, a struggle for power is underway among and within many states of the Middle East and North
Africa. This is a generational struggle in the aftermath of the 2003 Iraq war and 2011 Arab uprisings,
which will redefine the region as well as relationships among communities and between citizens and
their governments. This process will continue to be combustible, especially in societies where religious
extremists take root, or rulers reject democratic reforms, exploit their economies, and crush civil society.

Fifth, the global energy market has changed dramatically. The United States is now the world’s largest
natural gas and oil producer. Our dependence on foreign oil is at a 20-year low—and declining—and we
are leading a new clean energy economy. While production in the Middle East and elsewhere remains
vitally important for the global market, increased U.S. production is helping keep markets well-supplied
and prices conducive to economic growth. On the other hand, energy security concerns have been
exacerbated by European dependence on Russian natural gas and the willingness of Russia to use energy
for political ends. At the same time, developing countries now consume more energy than developed
ones, which is altering energy flows and changing consumer relationships.

Today's strategic environment is fluid. Just as the United States helped shape the course of events in
the last century, so must we influence their trajectory today by evolving the way we exercise American
leadership. This strategy outlines priorities based on a realistic assessment of the risks to our enduring
national interests and the opportunities for advancing them. This strategy eschews orienting our entire
foreign policy around a single threat or region. It establishes instead a diversified and balanced set of
priorities appropriate for the world’s leading global power with interests in every part of an increasingly
interconnected world.


II. Security

The United States government has no greater responsibility than protecting the American people. Yet,
our obligations do not end at our borders. We embrace our responsibilities for underwriting interna-
tional security because it serves our interests, upholds our commitments to allies and partners, and
addresses threats that are truly global. There is no substitute for American leadership whether in the
face of aggression, in the cause of universal values, or in the service of a more secure America. Fulfilling
our responsibilities depends on a strong defense and secure homeland. It also requires a global security
posture in which our unique capabilities are employed within diverse international coalitions and in
support of local partners. Such a shift is possible after a period of prolonged combat. Six years ago,
there were roughly 180,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, there are fewer than 15,000. This
transition has dramatically reduced U.S. casualties and allows us to realign our forces and resources to
meet an evolving set of threats while securing our strategic objectives.

In so doing, we will prioritize collective action to meet the persistent threat posed by terrorism today,
especially from al-Qaida, ISIL, and their affiliates. In addition to acting decisively to defeat direct threats,
we will focus on building the capacity of others to prevent the causes and consequences of conflict to
include countering extreme and dangerous ideologies. Keeping nuclear materials from terrorists and
preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons remains a high priority, as does mobilizing the inter-
national community to meet the urgent challenges posed by climate change and infectious disease.
Collective action is needed to assure access to the shared spaces—cyber, space, air, and oceans—where
the dangerous behaviors of some threaten us all.

Our allies will remain central to all these efforts. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is the
world’s preeminent multilateral alliance, reinforced by the historic close ties we have with the United
Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Canada. NATO is stronger and more cohesive than at any point in
its history, especially due to contributions of the Nordic countries and newer members like Poland and
the Baltic countries. Our alliances in Asia underwrite security and enable prosperity throughout Asia and
the Pacific. We will continue to modernize these essential bilateral alliances while enhancing the security
ties among our allies. Japan, South Korea, and Australia, as well as our close partner in New Zealand,
remain the model for interoperability while we reinvigorate our ties to the Philippines and preserve
our ties to Thailand. And our allies and partners in other regions, including our security partnership and
people-to-people ties with Israel, are essential to advancing our interests.

Strengthen Our National Defense

A strong military is the bedrock of our national security. During over a decade of war, the All Volunteer
Force has answered our Nation’s call. To maintain our military edge and readiness, we will continue to
insist on reforms and necessary investment in our military forces and their families. Our military will
remain ready to deter and defeat threats to the homeland, including against missile, cyber, and terrorist
attacks, while mitigating the effects of potential attacks and natural disasters. Our military is postured
globally to protect our citizens and interests, preserve regional stability, render humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief, and build the capacity of our partners to join with us in meeting security challenges.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

U.S. forces will continue to defend the homeland, conduct global counterterrorism operations, assure
allies, and deter aggression through forward presence and engagement. If deterrence fails, U.S. forces
will be ready to project power globally to defeat and deny aggression in multiple theaters.

As we modernize, we will apply the lessons of past drawdowns. Although our military will be smaller, it
must remain dominant in every domain. With the Congress, we must end sequestration and enact critical
reforms to build a versatile and responsive force prepared for a more diverse set of contingencies. We
will protect our investment in foundational capabilities like the nuclear deterrent, and we will grow our
investment in crucial capabilities like cyber; space; and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.
We will safeguard our science and technology base to keep our edge in the capabilities needed to pre-
vail against any adversary. Above all, we will take care of our people. We will recruit and retain the best
talent while developing leaders committed to an ethical and expert profession of arms. We will honor
our sacred trust with Veterans and the families and communities that support them, making sure those
who have served have the benefits, education, and opportunities they have earned.

We will be principled and selective in the use of force. The use of force should not be our first choice, but it
will sometimes be the necessary choice. The United States will use military force, unilaterally if necessary,
when our enduring interests demand it: when our people are threatened; when our livelihoods are at
stake; and when the security of our allies is in danger. In these circumstances, we prefer to act with allies
and partners. The threshold for military action is higher when our interests are not directly threatened. In
such cases, we will seek to mobilize allies and partners to share the burden and achieve lasting outcomes.
In all cases, the decision to use force must reflect a clear mandate and feasible objectives, and we must
ensure our actions are effective, just, and consistent with the rule of law. It should be based on a serious
appreciation for the risk to our mission, our global responsibilities, and the opportunity costs at home
and abroad. Whenever and wherever we use force, we will do so in a way that reflects our values and
strengthens our legitimacy.

Reinforce Homeland Security

Our homeland is more secure. But, we must continue to learn and adapt to evolving threats and hazards.
We are better able to guard against terrorism—the core responsibility of homeland security—as well as
illicit networks and other threats and hazards due to improved information sharing, aviation and border
security, and international cooperation. We have emphasized community-based efforts and local law
enforcement programs to counter homegrown violent extremism and protect vulnerable individuals
from extremist ideologies that could lead them to join conflicts overseas or carry out attacks here at
home. Through risk-based approaches, we have countered terrorism and transnational organized crime
in ways that enhance commerce, travel, and tourism and, most fundamentally, preserve our civil liber-
ties. We are more responsive and resilient when prevention fails or disaster strikes as witnessed with the
Boston Marathon bombings and Hurricane Sandy.

The essential services that underpin American society must remain secure and functioning in the face of
diverse threats and hazards. Therefore, we take a Whole of Community approach, bringing together all
elements of our society—individuals, local communities, the private and non-profit sectors, faith-based
organizations, and all levels of government—to make sure America is resilient in the face of adversity.

Il. SECURITY

We are working with the owners and operators of our Nation's critical cyber and physical infrastructure
across every sector—financial, energy, transportation, health, information technology, and more—to
decrease vulnerabilities and increase resilience. We are partnering with states and local communities
to better plan for, absorb, recover from, and adapt to adverse events brought about by the compound-
ing effects of climate change. We will also continue to enhance pandemic preparedness at home and
address the threat arising from new drug-resistant microbes and biological agents.

Combat the Persistent Threat of Terrorism

The threat of catastrophic attacks against our homeland by terrorists has diminished but still persists.
An array of terrorist threats has gained traction in areas of instability, limited opportunity, and broken
governance. Our adversaries are not confined to a distinct country or region. Instead, they range from
South Asia through the Middle East and into Africa. They include globally oriented groups like al-Qa’ida
and its affiliates, as well as a growing number of regionally focused and globally connected groups—
many with an al-Qa’ida pedigree like ISIL, which could pose a threat to the homeland.

We have drawn from the experience of the last decade and put in place substantial changes to our efforts
to combat terrorism, while preserving and strengthening important tools that have been developed
since 9/11. Specifically, we shifted away from a model of fighting costly, large-scale ground wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan in which the United States—particularly our military—bore an enormous burden.
Instead, we are now pursuing a more sustainable approach that prioritizes targeted counterterrorism
operations, collective action with responsible partners, and increased efforts to prevent the growth of
violent extremism and radicalization that drives increased threats. Our leadership will remain essential to
disrupting the unprecedented flow of foreign terrorist fighters to and from conflict zones. We will work
to address the underlying conditions that can help foster violent extremism such as poverty, inequal-
ity, and repression. This means supporting alternatives to extremist messaging and greater economic
opportunities for women and disaffected youth. We will help build the capacity of the most vulnerable
states and communities to defeat terrorists locally. Working with the Congress, we will train and equip
local partners and provide operational support to gain ground against terrorist groups. This will include
efforts to better fuse and share information and technology as well as to support more inclusive and
accountable governance.

In all our efforts, we aim to draw a stark contrast between what we stand for and the heinous deeds of
terrorists. We reject the lie that America and its allies are at war with Islam. We will continue to act lawfully.
Outside of areas of active hostilities, we endeavor to detain, interrogate, and prosecute terrorists through
law enforcement. However, when there is a continuing, imminent threat, and when capture or other
actions to disrupt the threat are not feasible, we will not hesitate to take decisive action. We will always
do so legally, discriminately, proportionally, and bound by strict accountability and strong oversight. The
United States—not our adversaries—will define the nature and scope of this struggle, lest it define us.

Our counterterrorism approach is at work with several states, including Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq.
In Afghanistan, we have ended our combat mission and transitioned to a dramatically smaller force
focused on the goal of a sovereign and stable partner in Afghanistan that is not a safe haven for interna-
tional terrorists. This has been made possible by the extraordinary sacrifices of our U.S. military, civilians

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

throughout the interagency, and our international partners. They delivered justice to Osama bin Laden
and significantly degraded al-Qa’ida’s core leadership. They helped increase life expectancy, access to
education, and opportunities for women and girls. Going forward, we will work with partners to carry out
a limited counterterrorism mission against the remnants of core al-Qa'ida and maintain our support to
the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). We are working with NATO and our other partners to train,
advise, and assist the ANSF as a new government takes responsibility for the security and well-being
of Afghanistan's citizens. We will continue to help improve governance that expands opportunity for
all Afghans, including women and girls. We will also work with the countries of the region, including
Pakistan, to mitigate the threat from terrorism and to support a viable peace and reconciliation process
to end the violence in Afghanistan and improve regional stability.

We have undertaken a comprehensive effort to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL. We will continue to
support lraq as it seeks to free itself from sectarian conflict and the scourge of extremists. Our support
is tied to the government's willingness to govern effectively and inclusively and to ensure ISIL cannot
sustain a safe haven on Iraqi territory. This requires professional and accountable Iraqi Security Forces
that can overcome sectarian divides and protect all lraqi citizens. It also requires international support,
which is why we are leading an unprecedented international coalition to work with the Iraqi government
and strengthen its military to regain sovereignty. Joined by our allies and partners, including multiple
countries in the region, we employed our unique military capabilities to arrest ISIL's advance and to
degrade their capabilities in both Iraq and Syria. At the same time, we are working with our partners to
train and equip a moderate Syrian opposition to provide a counterweight to the terrorists and the brutal-
ity of the Assad regime. Yet, the only lasting solution to Syria's civil war remains political—an inclusive
political transition that responds to the legitimate aspirations of all Syrian citizens.

Build Capacity to Prevent Conflict

We will strengthen U.S. and international capacity to prevent conflict among and within states. In the
realm of inter-state conflict, Russia's violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity—as well
as its belligerent stance toward other neighboring countries—endangers international norms that have
largely been taken for granted since the end of the Cold War. Meanwhile, North Korean provocation and
tensions in the East and South China Seas are reminders of the risks of escalation. American diplomacy
and leadership, backed by a strong military, remain essential to deterring future acts of inter-state
aggression and provocation by reaffirming our security commitments to allies and partners, investing
in their capabilities to withstand coercion, imposing costs on those who threaten their neighbors or
violate fundamental international norms, and embedding our actions within wider regional strategies.

Within states, the nexus of weak governance and widespread grievance allows extremism to take root,
violent non-state actors to rise up, and conflict to overtake state structures. To meet these challenges,
we will continue to work with partners and through multilateral organizations to address the root causes
of conflict before they erupt and to contain and resolve them when they do. We prefer to partner with
those fragile states that have a genuine political commitment to establishing legitimate governance
and providing for their people. The focus of our efforts will be on proven areas of need and impact, such
as inclusive politics, enabling effective and equitable service delivery, reforming security and rule of law
sectors, combating corruption and organized crime, and promoting economic opportunity, particularly

Il. SECURITY

among youth and women. We will continue to lead the effort to ensure women serve as mediators of
conflict and in peacebuilding efforts, and they are protected from gender-based violence.

We will continue to bolster the capacity of the U.N. and regional organizations to help resolve disputes,
build resilience to crises and shocks, strengthen governance, end extreme poverty, and increase prosper-
ity, so that fragile states can provide for the basic needs of their citizens and can avoid being vulnerable
hosts for extremism and terrorism. We will meet our financial commitments to the U.N., press for reforms
to strengthen peacekeeping, and encourage more contributions from advanced militaries. We will
strengthen the operational capacity of regional organizations like the African Union (AU) and broaden
the ranks of capable troop-contributing countries, including through the African Peacekeeping Rapid
Response Partnership, which will help African countries rapidly deploy to emerging crises.

Prevent the Spread and Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction

No threat poses as grave a danger to our security and well-being as the potential use of nuclear weapons
and materials by irresponsible states or terrorists. We therefore seek the peace and security of a world
without nuclear weapons. As long as nuclear weapons exist, the United States must invest the resources
necessary to maintain—without testing—a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent that preserves
strategic stability. However, reducing the threat requires us to constantly reinforce the basic bargain of
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which commits nuclear weapons states to reduce their stockpiles
while non-nuclear weapons states remain committed to using nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes.
For our part, we are reducing the role and number of nuclear weapons through New START and our own
strategy. We will continue to push for the entry into force of important multilateral agreements like the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty and the various regional nuclear weapons-free zone protocols,
as well as the creation of a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty.

Vigilance is required to stop countries and non-state actors from developing or acquiring nuclear,
chemical, or biological weapons, or the materials to build them. The Nuclear Security Summit process
has catalyzed a global effort to lock down vulnerable nuclear materials and institutionalize nuclear
security best practices. Our commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is rooted in the
profound risks posed by North Korean weapons development and proliferation. Our efforts to remove
and destroy chemical weapons in Libya and Syria reflect our leadership in implementation and progress
toward universalization of the Chemical Weapons Convention.

We have made clear Iran must meet its international obligations and demonstrate its nuclear program
is entirely peaceful. Our sanctions regime has demonstrated that the international community can—
and will—hold accountable those nations that do not meet their obligations, while also opening up
a space for a diplomatic resolution. Having reached a first step arrangement that stops the progress
of lran’s nuclear program in exchange for limited relief, our preference is to achieve a comprehensive
and verifiable deal that assures Iran’s nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes. This is the best
way to advance our interests, strengthen the global nonproliferation regime, and enable Iran to access
peaceful nuclear energy. However, we retain all options to achieve the objective of preventing Iran from
producing a nuclear weapon.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

Confront Climate Change

Climate change is an urgent and growing threat to our national security, contributing to increased
natural disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over basic resources like food and water. The present day
effects of climate change are being felt from the Arctic to the Midwest. Increased sea levels and storm
surges threaten coastal regions, infrastructure, and property. In turn, the global economy suffers, com-
pounding the growing costs of preparing and restoring infrastructure.

America is leading efforts at home and with the international community to confront this challenge.
Over the last 6 years, U.S. emissions have declined by a larger total magnitude than those of any other
country. Through our Climate Action Plan and related executive actions, we will go further with a goal
of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent of 2005 levels by 2025. Working with U.S.
states and private utilities, we will set the first-ever standards to cut the amount of carbon pollution our
power plants emit into the air. We are also working to strengthen resilience and address vulnerabilities
to climate impacts.

These domestic efforts contribute to our international leadership. Building on the progress made in
Copenhagen and in ensuing negotiations, we are working toward an ambitious new global climate
change agreement to shape standards for prevention, preparedness, and response over the next decade.
As the world’s two largest emitters, the United States and China reached a landmark agreement to take
significant action to reduce carbon pollution. The substantial contribution we have pledged to the Green
Climate Fund will help the most vulnerable developing nations deal with climate change, reduce their
carbon pollution, and invest in clean energy. More than 100 countries have also joined with us to reduce
greenhouse gases under the Montreal Protocol—the same agreement the world used successfully to
phase out ozone-depleting chemicals. We are partnering with African entrepreneurs to launch clean
energy projects and helping farmers practice climate-smart agriculture and plant more durable crops.
We are also driving collective action to reduce methane emissions from pipelines and to launch a free
trade agreement for environmental goods.

Assure Access to Shared Spaces

The world is connected by shared spaces—cyber, space, air, and oceans—that enable the free flow of
people, goods, services, and ideas. They are the arteries of the global economy and civil society, and
access is at risk due to increased competition and provocative behaviors. Therefore, we will continue
to promote rules for responsible behavior while making sure we have the capabilities to assure access
to these shared spaces.

Cybersecurity

As the birthplace of the Internet, the United States has a special responsibility to lead a networked world.
Prosperity and security increasingly depend on an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet. Our
economy, safety, and health are linked through a networked infrastructure that is targeted by malicious
government, criminal, and individual actors who try to avoid attribution. Drawing on the voluntary
cybersecurity framework, we are securing Federal networks and working with the private sector, civil
society, and other stakeholders to strengthen the security and resilience of U.S. critical infrastructure. We

Il. SECURITY

will continue to work with the Congress to pursue a legislative framework that ensures high standards.
We will defend ourselves, consistent with U.S. and international law, against cyber attacks and impose
costs on malicious cyber actors, including through prosecution of illegal cyber activity. We will assist
other countries to develop laws that enable strong action against threats that originate from their
infrastructure. Globally, cybersecurity requires that long-standing norms of international behavior—to
include protection of intellectual property, online freedom, and respect for civilian infrastructure—be
upheld, and the Internet be managed as a shared responsibility between states and the private sector
with civil society and Internet users as key stakeholders.

Space Security

Space systems allow the world to navigate and communicate with confidence to save lives, conduct
commerce, and better understand the human race, our planet, and the depths of the universe. As
countries increasingly derive benefits from space, we must join together to deal with threats posed
by those who may wish to deny the peaceful use of outer space. We are expanding our international
space cooperation activities in all sectors, promoting transparency and confidence-building measures
such as an International Code of Conduct on Outer Space Activities, and expanding partnerships with
the private sector in support of missions and capabilities previously claimed by governments alone.
We will also develop technologies and tactics to deter and defeat efforts to attack our space systems;
enable indications, warning, and attributions of such attacks; and enhance the resiliency of critical U.S.
space capabilities.

Air and Maritime Security

The United States has an enduring interest in freedom of navigation and overflight as well as the safety
and sustainability of the air and maritime environments. We will therefore maintain the capability to
ensure the free flow of commerce, to respond quickly to those in need, and to deter those who might
contemplate aggression. We insist on safe and responsible behaviors in the sky and at sea. We reject
illegal and aggressive claims to airspace and in the maritime domain and condemn deliberate attacks
on commercial passenger traffic. On territorial disputes, particularly in Asia, we denounce coercion
and assertive behaviors that threaten escalation. We encourage open channels of dialogue to resolve
disputes peacefully in accordance with international law. We also support the early conclusion of an
effective code of conduct for the South China Sea between China and the Association of Southeast Asian
States (ASEAN). America’s ability to press for the observance of established customary international law
reflected in the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea will be enhanced if the Senate provides its advice
and consent—the ongoing failure to ratify this Treaty undermines our national interest in a rules-based
international order. Finally, we seek to build on the unprecedented international cooperation of the
last few years, especially in the Arctic as well as in combatting piracy off the Horn of Africa and drug-
smuggling in the Caribbean Sea and across Southeast Asia.

Increase Global Health Security

The spread of infectious diseases constitute a growing risk. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa high-
lights the danger of a raging virus. The spread of new microbes or viruses, the rise and spread of drug

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

resistance, and the deliberate release of pathogens all represent threats that are exacerbated by the
globalization of travel, food production and supply, and medical products. Despite important scientific,
technological, and organizational accomplishments, most countries have not yet achieved international
core competencies for health security, and many lack sufficient capacity to prevent, detect, or respond
to disease outbreaks.

America is the world leader in fighting pandemics, including HIV/AIDS, and in improving global health
security. At home, we are strengthening our ability to prevent outbreaks and ensure sufficient capacity
to respond rapidly and manage biological incidents. As an exemplar of a modern and responsive public
health system, we will accelerate our work with partners through the Global Health Security Agenda in
pursuit of a world that is safer and more secure from infectious disease. We will save lives by strength-
ening regulatory frameworks for food safety and developing a global system to prevent avoidable
epidemics, detect and report disease outbreaks in real time, and respond more rapidly and effectively.
Finally, we will continue to lead efforts to combat the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

III. Prosperity

Our economy is the largest, most open, and innovative in the world. Our leadership has also helped
usher in a new era of unparalleled global prosperity. Sustaining our leadership depends on shaping an
emerging global economic order that continues to reflect our interests and values. Despite its success,
our rules-based system is now competing against alternative, less-open models. Moreover, the American
consumer cannot sustain global demand—growth must be more balanced. To meet this challenge,
we must be strategic in the use of our economic strength to set new rules of the road, strengthen our
partnerships, and promote inclusive development.

Through our trade and investment policies, we will shape globalization so that it is working for American
workers. By leveraging our improved economic and energy position, we will strengthen the global finan-
cial system and advance high-standard trade deals. We will ensure tomorrow's global trading system is
consistent with our interests and values by seeking to establish and enforce rules through international
institutions and regional initiatives and by addressing emerging challenges like state-owned enterprises
and digital protectionism. U.S. markets and educational opportunities will help the next generation of
global entrepreneurs sustain momentum in growing a global middle class. To prevent conflict and pro-
mote human dignity, we will also pursue policies that eradicate extreme poverty and reduce inequality.

Put Our Economy to Work

The American economy is an engine for global economic growth and a source of stability for the interna-
tional system. In addition to being a key measure of power and influence in its own right, it underwrites
our military strength and diplomatic influence. A strong economy, combined with a prominent U.S.
presence in the global financial system, creates opportunities to advance our security.

To ensure our economic competitiveness, we are investing in a new foundation for sustained economic
growth that creates good jobs and rising incomes. Because knowledge is the currency of today’s global
economy, we must keep expanding access to early childhood and affordable higher education. The
further acceleration of our manufacturing revolution will create the next generation of high technology
manufacturing jobs. Immigration reform that combines smart and effective enforcement of the law with
a pathway to citizenship for those who earn it remains an imperative. We will deliver quality, affordable
healthcare to more and more Americans. We will also support job creation, strengthen the middle class,
and spur economic growth by opening markets and leveling the playing field for American workers
and businesses abroad. Jobs will also grow as we expand our work with trading partners to eliminate
barriers to the full deployment of U.S. innovation in the digital space. These efforts are complemented
by more modern and reliable infrastructure that ensures safety and enables growth.

In addition to the positive benefits of trade and commerce, a strong and well-regulated economy
positions the United States to lead international efforts to promote financial transparency and prevent
the global financial system from being abused by transnational criminal and terrorist organizations
to engage in, or launder the proceeds of illegal activity. We will continue to work within the Financial
Action Task Force, the G-20, and other fora to enlist all nations in the fight to protect the integrity of the
global financial system.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

Advance Our Energy Security

The United States is now the world leader in oil and gas production. America’s energy revival is not only
good for growth, it offers new buffers against the coercive use of energy by some and new opportuni-
ties for helping others transition to low-carbon economies. American oil production has increased
dramatically, impacting global markets. Imports have decreased substantially, reducing the funds we
send overseas. Consumption has declined, reducing our vulnerability to global supply disruption and
price shocks. However, we still have a significant stake in the energy security of our allies in Europe and
elsewhere. Seismic shifts in supply and demand are underway across the globe. Increasing global access
to reliable and affordable energy is one of the most powerful ways to support social and economic
development and to help build new markets for U.S. technology and investment.

The challenges faced by Ukrainian and European dependence on Russian energy supplies puts a spot-
light on the need for an expanded view of energy security that recognizes the collective needs of the
United States, our allies, and trading partners as well as the importance of competitive energy markets.
Therefore, we must promote diversification of energy fuels, sources, and routes, as well as encourage
indigenous sources of energy supply. Greater energy security and independence within the Americas
is central to these efforts. We will also stay engaged with global suppliers and our partners to reduce
the potential for energy-related conflict in places like the Arctic and Asia. Our energy security will be
further enhanced by living up to commitments made in the Rome Declaration and through our all-of-
the-above energy strategy for a low-carbon world. We will continue to develop American fossil resources
while becoming a more efficient country that develops cleaner, alternative fuels and vehicles. We are
demonstrating that America can and will lead the global economy while reducing our emissions.

Lead in Science, Technology, and Innovation

Scientific discovery and technological innovation empower American leadership with a competitive
edge that secures our military advantage, propels our economy, and improves the human condition.
Sustaining that edge requires robust Federal investments in basic and applied research. We must also
strengthen science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education to produce tomorrow's
discoverers, inventors, entrepreneurs, and high-skills workforce. Our commitment remains strong to
preparation and compensation for STEM teachers, broadband connectivity and high-tech educational
tools for schools, programs that inspire and provide opportunities for girls and underrepresented minori-
ties, and support for innovation in STEM teaching and inclusion in higher education. We will also keep
our edge by opening our national labs to more commercial partnerships while tapping research and
development in the private sector, including a wide range of start-ups and firms at the leading edge of
America’s innovation economy.

Shape the Global Economic Order

We have recovered from the global economic crisis, but much remains to be done to shape the emerg-
ing economic order to avoid future crises. We have responsibilities at home to continue to improve our
banking practices and forge ahead with regulatory reform, even as we press others to align with our
robust standards. In addition to securing our immediate economic interests, we must drive the inclu-

III. PROSPERITY

sive economic growth that creates demand for American exports. We will protect the free movement
of information and work to prevent the risky behavior that led to the recent crisis, while addressing
resurgent economic forces, from state capitalism to market-distorting free-riding.

American leadership is central to strengthening global finance rules and making sure they are consistent
and transparent. We will work through the G-20 to reinforce the core architecture of the international
financial and economic system, including the World Trade Organization, to ensure it is positioned to
foster both stability and growth. We remain committed to governance reforms for these same institu-
tions, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to make them more effective and
representative. In so doing, we seek to ensure institutions reinforce, rather than undermine, an effective
global financial system.

We believe trade agreements have economic and strategic benefits for the United States. We will there-
fore work with the Congress to achieve bipartisan renewal of Trade Promotion Authority and to advance
a trade agenda that brings jobs to our shores, increases standards of living, strengthens our partners and
allies, and promotes stability in critical regions. The United States has one of the most open economies
in the world. Our tariffs are low, and we do not use regulation to discriminate against foreign goods. The
same is not true throughout the world, which is why our trade agenda is focused on lowering tariffs on
American products, breaking down barriers to our goods and services, and setting higher standards to
level the playing field for American workers and firms.

Through the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP),
we are setting the world's highest standards for labor rights and environmental protection, while remov-
ing barriers to U.S. exports and putting the United States at the center of a free trade zone covering
two-thirds of the global economy. Our goal is to use this position, along with our highly skilled workforce,
strong rule of law, and abundant supply of affordable energy, to make America the production platform
of choice and the premier investment destination. In addition to these major regional agreements, we
will work to achieve groundbreaking agreements to liberalize trade in services, information technol-
ogy, and environmental goods—areas where the United States is a global leader in innovation. And
we will make it easier for businesses of all sizes to expand their reach by improving supply chains and
regulatory cooperation.

All countries will benefit when we open markets further, extend and enhance tools such as the African
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and reduce inefficiencies in the global trading system through
trade facilitation improvements. And through our development initiatives—such as Power Africa, Trade
Africa, Feed the Future, and the Open Government Partnership—we will continue to work closely with
governments, the private sector, and civil society to foster inclusive economic growth, reduce corrup-
tion, and build capacity at the local level. Investment in critical infrastructure and security will facilitate
trade among countries, especially for developing and emerging economies.

End Extreme Poverty

We have an historic opportunity to end extreme poverty within a generation and put our societies on
a path of shared and sustained prosperity. In so doing, we will foster export markets for U.S. businesses,
improve investment opportunities, and decrease the need for costly military interventions. Growth

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

in the global economy has lifted hundreds of millions out of extreme poverty. We have already made
significant progress guided in part through global consensus and mobilization around the Millennium
Development Goals. The world cut the percentage of people living in extreme poverty in half between
1990 and 2010. In that period, nearly 800 million people rose above the international poverty line. By
2012, child deaths were down almost 50 percent since 1990. Twenty-nine countries registered as low-
income in 2000 have today achieved middle-income status, and private capital and domestic resources
far outstrip donor assistance as the primary means for financing development. Trends in economic
growth also signal what is possible; sub-Saharan Africa has averaged an aggregate annual growth rate
of over 5 percent for the last decade despite the disruptions of the world financial crisis.

We are now working with many partners to put ending extreme poverty at the center of a new global
sustainable development agenda that will mobilize action for the next 15 years. We will press for
transformative investments in areas like women’s equality and empowerment, education, sustainable
energy, and governance. We will use trade and investment to harness job-rich economic growth. We
will concentrate on the clear need for country ownership and political commitment and reinforce the
linkage between social and economic development. We will lead the effort to marshal diverse resources
and broad coalitions to advance the imperative of accountable, democratic governance.

We will use our leadership to promote a model of financing that leverages billions in investment from
the private sector and draws on America’s scientific, technological, and entrepreneurial strengths to
take to scale proven solutions in partnership with governments, business, and civil society. And we will
leverage our leadership in promoting food security, enhancing resilience, modernizing rural agriculture,
reducing the vulnerability of the poor, and eliminating preventable child and maternal deaths as we
drive progress toward an AIDS-free generation.

IV. Values

To lead effectively in a world experiencing significant political change, the United States must live our
values at home while promoting universal values abroad. From the Middle East to Ukraine to Southeast
Asia to the Americas, citizens are more empowered in seeking greater freedoms and accountable
institutions. But these demands have often produced an equal and opposite reaction from backers of
discredited authoritarian orders, resulting in crackdowns and conflict. Many of the threats to our security
in recent years arose from efforts by authoritarian states to oppose democratic forces—from the crisis
caused by Russian aggression in Ukraine to the rise of ISIL within the Syrian civil war. By the same token,
many of our greatest opportunities stem from advances for liberty and rule of law—from sub-Saharan
Africa to Eastern Europe to Burma.

Defending democracy and human rights is related to every enduring national interest. It aligns us with
the aspirations of ordinary people throughout the world. We know from our own history people must
lead their own struggles for freedom if those struggles are to succeed. But America is also uniquely situ-
ated—and routinely expected—to support peaceful democratic change. We will continue mobilizing
international support to strengthen and expand global norms of human rights. We will support women,
youth, civil society, journalists, and entrepreneurs as drivers of change. We will continue to insist that
governments uphold their human rights obligations, speak out against repression wherever it occurs,
and work to prevent, and, if necessary, respond to mass atrocities.

Our closest allies in these efforts will be, as they always have, other democratic states. But, even where our
strategic interests require us to engage governments that do not share all our values, we will continue to
speak out clearly for human rights and human dignity in our public and private diplomacy. Any support
we might provide will be balanced with an awareness of the costs of repressive policies for our own
security interests and the democratic values by which we live. Because our human rights advocacy will
be most effective when we work in concert with a wide range of partners, we are building coalitions with
civil society, religious leaders, businesses, other governments, and international organizations. We will
also work to ensure people enjoy the same rights—and security—online as they are entitled to enjoy
offline by opposing efforts to restrict information and punish speech.

Live Our Values

Our values are a source of strength and security, and our ability to promote our values abroad is directly
tied to our willingness to abide by them at home. In recent years, questions about America’s post-9/11
security policies have often been exploited by our adversaries, while testing our commitment to civil
liberties and the rule of law at home. For the sake of our security and our leadership in the world, it is
essential we hold ourselves to the highest possible standard, even as we do whatis necessary to secure
our people.

To that end, we strengthened our commitment against torture and have prohibited so-called enhanced
interrogation techniques that were contrary to American values, while implementing stronger safe-
guards for the humane treatment of detainees. We have transferred many detainees from Guantanamo
Bay, and we are working with the Congress to remove the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

so that we can finally close it. Where prosecution is an option, we will bring terrorists to justice through
both civilian and, when appropriate, reformed military commission proceedings that incorporate fun-
damental due process and other protections essential to the effective administration of justice.

Our vital intelligence activities are also being reformed to preserve the capabilities needed to secure
our interests while continuing to respect privacy and curb the potential for abuse. We are increasing
transparency so the public can be confident our surveillance activities are consistent with the rule of law
and governed by effective oversight. We have not and will not collect signals intelligence to suppress
criticism or dissent or to afford a competitive advantage to U.S. companies. Safeguards currently in place
governing how we retain and share intelligence are being extended to protect personal information
regardless of nationality.

Advance Equality

American values are reflective of the universal values we champion all around the world—including the
freedoms of speech, worship, and peaceful assembly; the ability to choose leaders democratically; and
the right to due process and equal administration of justice. We will be a champion for communities that
are too frequently vulnerable to violence, abuse, and neglect—such as ethnic and religious minorities;
people with disabilities; Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) individuals; displaced persons;
and migrant workers.

Recognizing that no society will succeed if it does not draw on the potential of all its people, we are
pressing for the political and economic participation of women and girls—who are too often denied
their inalienable rights and face substantial barriers to opportunity in too many places. Our efforts
include helping girls everywhere get the education they need to participate fully in the economy and
realize their potential. We are focused on reducing the scourge of violence against women around the
globe by providing support for affected populations and enhancing efforts to improve judicial systems
so perpetrators are held accountable.

Support Emerging Democracies

The United States will concentrate attention and resources to help countries consolidate their gains and
move toward more democratic and representative systems of governance. Our focus is on supporting
countries that are moving in the right direction—whether it is the peaceful transitions of power we
see in sub-Saharan Africa; the movement toward constitutional democracy in Tunisia; or the opening
taking place in Burma. In each instance, we are creating incentives for positive reform and disincentives
for backsliding.

The road from demanding rights in the square to building institutions that guarantee them is long
and hard. In the last quarter century, parts of Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa, and East Asia have
consolidated transitions to democracy, but not without setbacks. The popular uprisings that began in
the Arab world took place in a region with weaker democratic traditions, powerful authoritarian elites,
sectarian tensions, and active violent extremist elements, so it is not surprising setbacks have thus far
outnumbered triumphs. Yet, change is inevitable in the Middle East and North Africa, as it is in all places
where the illusion of stability is artificially maintained by silencing dissent.

* 20 *

IV. VALUES

But the direction of that change is not predetermined. We will therefore continue to look for ways to
support the success and ease the difficulties of democratic transitions through responsible assistance,
investment and trade, and by supporting political, economic, and security reforms. We will continue
to push for reforms in authoritarian countries not currently undergoing wholesale transitions. Good
governance is also predicated on strengthening the state-society relationship. When citizens have a
voice in the decisionmaking that affects them, governments make better decisions and citizens are
better able to participate, innovate, and contribute.

The corrosive effects of corruption must be overcome. While information sharing allows us to identify
corrupt officials more easily, globalization has also made it easier for corrupt officials to hide the proceeds
of corruption abroad, increasing the need for strong and consistent implementation of the international
standards on combating illicit finance. The United States is leading the way in promoting adherence
to standards of accountable and transparent governance, including through initiatives like the Open
Government Partnership. We will utilize a broad range of tools to recover assets stolen by corrupt offi-
cials and make it harder for criminals to hide, launder, and benefit from illegal proceeds. Our leadership
toward governance that is more open, responsible, and accountable makes clear that democracy can
deliver better government and development for ordinary people.

Empower Civil Society and Young Leaders

Democracy depends on more than elections, or even government institutions. Through civil society,
citizens come together to hold their leaders accountable and address challenges. Civil society organiza-
tions often drive innovations and develop new ideas and approaches to solve social, economic, and
political problems that governments can apply on a larger scale. Moreover, by giving people peaceful
avenues to advance their interests and express their convictions, a free and flourishing civil society
contributes to stability and helps to counter violent extremism.

Still, civil society and individual activists face challenges in many parts of the world. As technology
empowers individuals and nongovernmental groups to mobilize around a wide array of issues—from
countering corruption and advancing the rule of law to environmental activism—political elites in
authoritarian states, and even in some with more democratic traditions, are acting to restrict space for
civil society. Restrictions are often seen through new laws and regulations that deny groups the foreign
funding they depend on to operate, that criminalize groups of people like the LGBT community, or deny
political opposition groups the freedom to assemble in peaceful protest. The United States is countering
this trend by providing direct support for civil society and by advocating rollback of laws and regulations
that undermine citizens’ rights. We are also supporting technologies that expand access to information,
enable freedom of expression, and connect civil society groups in this fight around the world.

More than 50 percent of the world’s people are under 30 years old. Many struggle to make a life in
countries with broken governance. We are taking the initiative to build relationships with the world’s
young people, identifying future leaders in government, business, and civil society and connecting them
to one another and to the skills they need to thrive. We have established new programs of exchange
among young Americans and young people from Africa to Southeast Asia, building off the successes
of the International Visitor and Young African Leaders initiatives. We are fostering increased education

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

exchanges in our hemisphere. And we are catalyzing economic growth and innovation within societies
by lifting up and promoting entrepreneurship.

Prevent Mass Atrocities

The mass killing of civilians is an affront to our common humanity and a threat to our common security. It
destabilizes countries and regions, pushes refugees across borders, and creates grievances that extrem-
ists exploit. We have a strong interest in leading an international response to genocide and mass atroci-
ties when they arise, recognizing options are more extensive and less costly when we act preventively
before situations reach crisis proportions. We know the risk of mass atrocities escalates when citizens
are denied basic rights and freedoms, are unable to hold accountable the institutions of government,
or face unrelenting poverty and conflict. We affirm our support for the international consensus that
governments have the responsibility to protect civilians from mass atrocities and that this responsibil-
ity passes to the broader international community when those governments manifestly fail to protect
their populations. We will work with the international community to prevent and call to account those
responsible for the worst human rights abuses, including through support to the International Criminal
Court, consistent with U.S. law and our commitment to protecting our personnel. Moreover, we will
continue to mobilize allies and partners to strengthen our collective efforts to prevent and respond to
mass atrocities using all our instruments of national power.

* 22 *

V. International Order

We have an opportunity—and obligation—to lead the way in reinforcing, shaping, and where appropri-
ate, creating the rules, norms, and institutions that are the foundation for peace, security, prosperity, and
the protection of human rights in the 21st century. The modern-day international system currently relies
heavily on an international legal architecture, economic and political institutions, as well as alliances and
partnerships the United States and other like-minded nations established after World War Il. Sustained
by robust American leadership, this system has served us well for 70 years, facilitating international
cooperation, burden sharing, and accountability. It carried us through the Cold War and ushered in a
wave of democratization. It reduced barriers to trade, expanded free markets, and enabled advances
in human dignity and prosperity.

But, the system has never been perfect, and aspects of it are increasingly challenged. We have seen too
many cases where a failure to marshal the will and resources for collective action has led to inaction.
The U.N. and other multilateral institutions are stressed by, among other things, resource demands,
competing imperatives among member states, and the need for reform across a range of policy and
administrative areas. Despite these undeniable strains, the vast majority of states do not want to replace
the system we have. Rather, they look to America for the leadership needed to both fortify it and help
it evolve to meet the wide range of challenges described throughout this strategy.

The United States will continue to make the development of sustainable solutions in all of these areas
a foreign policy priority and devote diplomatic and other resources accordingly. We will continue to
embrace the post-World War Il legal architecture—from the U.N. Charter to the multilateral treaties that
govern the conduct of war, respect for human rights, nonproliferation, and many other topics of global
concern—as essential to the ordering of a just and peaceful world, where nations live peacefully within
their borders, and all men and women have the opportunity to reach their potential. We will lead by
example in fulfilling our responsibilities within this architecture, demonstrating to the world it is pos-
sible to protect security consistent with robust values. We will work vigorously both within the U.N. and
other multilateral institutions, and with member states, to strengthen and modernize capacities—from
peacekeeping to humanitarian relief—so they endure to provide protection, stability, and support for
future generations.

At the same time, we will exact an appropriate cost on transgressors. Targeted economic sanctions
remain an effective tool for imposing costs on those irresponsible actors whose military aggression, illicit
proliferation, or unprovoked violence threaten both international rules and norms and the peace they
were designed to preserve. We will pursue multilateral sanctions, including through the U.N., whenever
possible, but will act alone, if necessary. Our sanctions will continue to be carefully designed and tailored
to achieve clear aims while minimizing any unintended consequences for other economic actors, the
global economy, and civilian populations.

In many cases, our use of targeted sanctions and other coercive measures are meant not only to uphold
international norms, but to deter severe threats to stability and order at the regional level. We are not
allowing the transgressors to define our regional strategies on the basis of the immediate threats they
present. Rather, we are advancing a longer-term affirmative agenda in each of the regions, which pri-

* 23 *

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

oritizes reinvigorating alliances with long-standing friends, making investments in new partnerships
with emerging democratic powers with whom our interests are increasingly aligned, and continuing
to support the development of capable, inclusive regional institutions to help enforce common inter-
national rules.

Advance Our Rebalance to Asia and the Pacific

The United States has been and will remain a Pacific power. Over the next 5 years, nearly half of all
growth outside the United States is expected to come from Asia. That said, the security dynamics of the
region—including contested maritime territorial claims and a provocative North Korea—risk escalation
and conflict. American leadership will remain essential to shaping the region's long-term trajectory to
enhance stability and security, facilitate trade and commerce through an open and transparent system,
and ensure respect for universal rights and freedoms.

To realize this vision, we are diversifying our security relationships in Asia as well as our defense posture
and presence. We are modernizing our alliances with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines
and enhancing the interactions among them to ensure they are fully capable of responding to regional
and global challenges. We are committed to strengthening regional institutions such as ASEAN, the East
Asia Summit, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation to reinforce shared rules and norms, forge collective
responses to shared challenges, and help ensure peaceful resolution of disputes. We are also working
with our Asian partners to promote more open and transparent economies and regional support for
international economic norms that are vital to maintaining it as an engine for global economic growth.
The TPP is central to this effort.

As we have done since World War Il, the United States will continue to support the advance of security,
development, and democracy in Asia and the Pacific. This is an important focus of the deepening part-
nerships we are building in Southeast Asia including with Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia. We will
uphold our treaty obligations to South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand, while encouraging
the latter to return quickly to democracy. We will support the people of Burma to deepen and sustain
reforms, including democratic consolidation and national reconciliation.

The United States welcomes the rise of a stable, peaceful, and prosperous China. We seek to develop a
constructive relationship with China that delivers benefits for our two peoples and promotes security
and prosperity in Asia and around the world. We seek cooperation on shared regional and global chal-
lenges such as climate change, public health, economic growth, and the denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula. While there will be competition, we reject the inevitability of confrontation. At the same time,
we will manage competition from a position of strength while insisting that China uphold international
rules and norms on issues ranging from maritime security to trade and human rights. We will closely
monitor China's military modernization and expanding presence in Asia, while seeking ways to reduce
the risk of misunderstanding or miscalculation. On cybersecurity, we will take necessary actions to
protect our businesses and defend our networks against cyber-theft of trade secrets for commercial
gain whether by private actors or the Chinese government.

In South Asia, we continue to strengthen our strategic and economic partnership with India. As the
world’s largest democracies, we share inherent values and mutual interests that form the cornerstone

* 24 &

V. INTERNATIONAL ORDER

of our cooperation, particularly in the areas of security, energy, and the environment. We support India’s
role as a regional provider of security and its expanded participation in critical regional institutions. We
see a strategic convergence with India’s Act East policy and our continued implementation of the rebal-
ance to Asia and the Pacific. At the same time, we will continue to work with both India and Pakistan
to promote strategic stability, combat terrorism, and advance regional economic integration in South
and Central Asia.

Strengthen Our Enduring Alliance with Europe

The United States maintains a profound commitment to a Europe that is free, whole, and at peace. A
strong Europe is our indispensable partner, including for tackling global security challenges, promoting
prosperity, and upholding international norms. Our work with Europe leverages our strong and historic
bilateral relationships throughout the continent. We will steadfastly support the aspirations of countries
in the Balkans and Eastern Europe toward European and Euro-Atlantic integration, continue to trans-
form our relationship with Turkey, and enhance ties with countries in the Caucasus while encouraging
resolution of regional conflict.

NATO is the strongest alliance the world has ever known and is the hub of an expanding global security
network. Our Article 5 commitment to the collective defense of all NATO Members is ironclad, as is our
commitment to ensuring the Alliance remains ready and capable for crisis response and cooperative
security. We will continue to deepen our relationship with the European Union (EU), which has helped
to promote peace and prosperity across the region, and deepen NATO-EU ties to enhance transatlantic
security. To build on the millions of jobs supported by transatlantic trade, we support a pro-growth
agenda in Europe to strengthen and broaden the region's recovery, and we seek an ambitious T-TIP to
boost exports, support jobs, and raise global standards for trade.

Russia's aggression in Ukraine makes clear that European security and the international rules and norms
against territorial aggression cannot be taken for granted. In response, we have led an international
effort to support the Ukrainian people as they choose their own future and develop their democracy
and economy. We are reassuring our allies by backing our security commitments and increasing respon-
siveness through training and exercises, as well as a dynamic presence in Central and Eastern Europe to
deter further Russian aggression. This will include working with Europe to improve its energy security
in both the short and long term. We will support partners such as Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine so
they can better work alongside the United States and NATO, as well as provide for their own defense.

And we will continue to impose significant costs on Russia through sanctions and other means while
countering Moscow’s deceptive propaganda with the unvarnished truth. We will deter Russian aggres-
sion, remain alert to its strategic capabilities, and help our allies and partners resist Russian coercion over
the long term, if necessary. At the same time, we will keep the door open to greater collaboration with
Russia in areas of common interests, should it choose a different path—a path of peaceful cooperation
that respects the sovereignty and democratic development of neighboring states.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

Seek Stability and Peace in the Middle East and North Africa

In the Middle East, we will dismantle terrorist networks that threaten our people, confront external
aggression against our allies and partners, ensure the free flow of energy from the region to the world,
and prevent the development, proliferation, or use of weapons of mass destruction. At the same time,
we remain committed to a vision of the Middle East that is peaceful and prosperous, where democracy
takes root and human rights are upheld. Sadly, this is not the case today, and nowhere is the violence
more tragic and destabilizing than in the sectarian conflict from Beirut to Baghdad, which has given rise
to new terrorist groups such as ISIL.

Resolving these connected conflicts, and enabling long-term stability in the region, requires more than
the use and presence of American military forces. For one, it requires partners who can defend them-
selves. We are therefore investing in the ability of Israel, Jordan, and our Gulf partners to deter aggression
while maintaining our unwavering commitment to Israel's security, including its Qualitative Military
Edge. We are working with the lraqi government to resolve Sunni grievances through more inclusive
and responsive governance. With our partners in the region and around the world, we are leading a
comprehensive counterterrorism strategy to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL. At the same time, we
will continue to pursue a lasting political solution to the devastating conflict in Syria.

Stability and peace in the Middle East and North Africa also requires reducing the underlying causes
of conflict. America will therefore continue to work with allies and partners toward a comprehensive
agreement with Iran that resolves the world’s concerns with the Iranian nuclear program. We remain
committed to ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a two-state solution that ensures Israel's
security and Palestine’s viability. We will support efforts to deescalate sectarian tensions and violence
between Shi’a and Sunni communities throughout the region. We will help countries in transition make
political and economic reforms and build state capacity to maintain security, law and order, and respect
for universal rights. In this respect, we seek a stable Yemen that undertakes difficult structural reforms and
confronts an active threat from al-Qa'ida and other rebels. We will work with Tunisia to further progress
on building democratic institutions and strengthening its economy. We will work with the U.N. and our
Arab and European partners in an effort to help stabilize Libya and reduce the threat posed by lawless
militias and extremists. And we will maintain strategic cooperation with Egypt to enable it to respond to
shared security threats, while broadening our partnership and encouraging progress toward restoration
of democratic institutions.

Invest in Africa’s Future

Africa is rising. Many countries in Africa are making steady progress in growing their economies,
improving democratic governance and rule of law, and supporting human rights and basic freedoms.
Urbanization and a burgeoning youth population are changing the region’s demographics, and young
people are increasingly making their voices heard. But there are still many countries where the transi-
tion to democracy is uneven and slow with some leaders clinging to power. Corruption is endemic and
public health systems are broken in too many places. And too many governments are responding to the
expansion of civil society and free press by passing laws and adopting policies that erode that progress.
Ongoing conflicts in Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African

V. INTERNATIONAL ORDER

Republic, as well as violent extremists fighting governments in Somalia, Nigeria, and across the Sahel
all pose threats to innocent civilians, regional stability, and our national security.

For decades, American engagement with Africa was defined by aid to help Africans reduce insecurity,
famine, and disease. In contrast, the partnerships we are forging today, and will expand in the coming
years, aim to build upon the aspirations of Africans. Through our Power Africa Initiative, we aim to double
access to power in sub-Saharan Africa. We will increase trade and business ties, generating export-driven
growth through initiatives like Trade Africa and AGOA. We will continue to support U.S. companies to
deepen investment in what can be the world’s next major center of global growth, including through
the Doing Business in Africa campaign. Moreover, we are investing in tomorrow's leaders—the young
entrepreneurs, innovators, civic leaders, and public servants who will shape the continent's future. We
are strengthening civilian and military institutions through our Security Governance Initiative, and
working to advance human rights and eliminate corruption. We are deepening our security partnerships
with African countries and institutions, exemplified by our partnerships with the U.N. and AU in Mali
and Somalia. Such efforts will help to resolve conflicts, strengthen African peacekeeping capacity, and
counter transnational security threats while respecting human rights and the rule of law.

Our investment in nutrition and agricultural capacity will continue, reducing hunger through initiatives
such as Feed the Future. We will keep working with partners to reduce deaths from Ebola, HIV/AIDS,
malaria, and tuberculosis across Africa through such initiatives as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief and the Global Health Security Agenda. The Ebola epidemic in 2014 serves as a stark reminder of
the threat posed by infectious disease and the imperative of global collective action to meet it. American
leadership has proven essential to bringing to bear the international community to contain recent crises
while building public health capacity to prevent future ones.

Deepen Economic and Security Cooperation in the Americas

We will continue to advance a Western Hemisphere that is prosperous, secure, democratic, and plays
a greater global role. In the region as a whole, the number of people in the middle class has surpassed
the number of people living in poverty for the first time in history, and the hemisphere is increasingly
important to global energy supplies. These gains, however, are put at risk by weak institutions, high
crime rates, powerful organized crime groups, an illicit drug trade, lingering economic disparity, and
inadequate education and health systems.

To meet these challenges, we are working with Canada and Mexico to enhance our collective economic
competitiveness while advancing prosperity in our hemisphere. With Chile, Peru, Mexico, and Canada,
we are setting new global trade standards as we grow a strong contingent of countries in the Americas
that favor open trading systems to include TPP. We seek to advance our economic partnership with Brazil,
as it works to preserve gains in reducing poverty and deliver the higher standards of public services
expected by the middle class.

We are also championing a strong and effective inter-American human rights and rule of law system.
We are expanding our collaboration across the Americas to support democratic consolidation and
increase public-private partnerships in education, sustainable development, access to electricity, climate
resilience, and countering transnational organized crime.

* 27

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

Such collaboration is especially important in vulnerable countries like Guatemala, El Salvador, and
Honduras, where government institutions are threatened by criminal syndicates. Migration surges
involving unaccompanied children across our southern border is one major consequence of weak
institutions and violence. American leadership, in partnership with these countries and with the support
of their neighbors, remains essential to arresting the slide backwards and to creating steady improve-
ments in economic growth and democratic governance. Likewise, we remain committed to helping
rebuild Haiti and to put it and our other Caribbean neighbors on a path to sustainable development.

We will support the resolution of longstanding regional conflicts, particularly Colombia's conclusion
of a peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. Overall, we have deepened our
strategic partnership with Colombia, which is a key contributor to international peace and security.
Equally, we stand by the citizens of countries where the full exercise of democracy is at risk, such as
Venezuela. Though a few countries in the region remain trapped in old ideological debates, we will keep
working with all governments that are interested in cooperating with us in practical ways to reinforce
the principles enumerated in the Inter-American Democratic Charter. As part of our effort to promote a
fully democratic hemisphere, we will advance our new opening to Cuba in a way that most effectively
promotes the ability of the Cuban people to determine their future freely.

VI. Conclusion

This National Security Strategy provides a vision for strengthening and sustaining American leadership
in this still young century. It clarifies the purpose and promise of American power. It aims to advance our
interests and values with initiative and from a position of strength. We will deter and defeat any adversary
that threatens our national security and that of our allies. We confidently welcome the peaceful rise of
other countries as partners to share the burdens for maintaining a more peaceful and prosperous world.
We will continue to collaborate with established and emerging powers to promote our shared security
and defend our common humanity, even as we compete with them in economic and other realms. We
will uphold and refresh the international rules and norms that set the parameters for such collaboration
and competition. We will do all of this and more with confidence that the international system whose
creation we led in the aftermath of World War II will continue to serve America and the world well. This
is an ambitious, but achievable agenda, especially if we continue to restore the bipartisan center that
has been a pillar of strength for American foreign policy in decades past. America has greater capacity
to adapt and recover from setbacks than any other country. A core element of our strength is our unity
and our certainty that American leadership in this century, like the last, remains indispensable.

THE WHITE HOUSE

WASHINGTON, DC

My fellow Americans:

The American people elected me to make America great again. I promised that my Administration would
put the safety, interests, and well-being of our citizens first. I pledged that we would revitalize the American

economy, rebuild our military, defend our borders, protect our sovereignty, and advance our values.

During my first year in office, you have witnessed my America First foreign policy in action. We are
prioritizing the interests of our citizens and protecting our sovereign rights as a nation. America is
leading again on the world stage. We are not hiding from the challenges we face. We are confronting

themhead-onand pursuing opportunitiesto promote the security and prosperity ofall Americans.

The United States faces an extraordinarily dangerous world, filled with a wide range of threats that have
intensified in recent years. When I came into office, rogue regimes were developing nuclear weapons
and missiles to threaten the entire planet. Radical Islamist terror groups were flourishing. Terrorists had
taken control of vast swaths of the Middle East. Rival powers were aggressively undermining American
interests around the globe. At home, porous borders and unenforced immigration laws had created a host
of vulnerabilities. Criminal cartels were bringing drugs and danger into our communities. Unfair trade
practices had weakened our economy and exported our jobs overseas. Unfair burden-sharing with our allies
and inadequate investment in our own defense had invited danger from those who wish us harm. Too many

Americans had lost trust in our government, faith in our future, and confidence in our values.
Nearly one year later, although serious challenges remain, we are charting a new and very different course.

We are rallying the world against the rogue regime in North Korea and confronting the danger posed
by the dictatorship in Iran, which those determined to pursue a flawed nuclear deal had neglected. We
have renewed our friendships in the Middle East and partnered with regional leaders to help drive out
terrorists and extremists, cut off their financing, and discredit their wicked ideology. We crushed
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorists on the battlefields of Syria and Iraq, and will continue
pursuing them until they are destroyed. America’s allies are now contributing more to our common
defense, strengthening even our strongest alliances. We have also continued to make clear that the United

States will no longer tolerate economic aggression or unfair trading practices.

At home, we have restored confidence in America’s purpose. We have recommitted ourselves to
our founding principles and to the values that have made our families, communities, and society so
successful. Jobs are coming back and our economy is growing. We are making historic investments in
the United States military. We are enforcing our borders, building trade relationships based on fairness

and reciprocity, and defending America’s sovereignty without apology.

 

O

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

The whole world is lifted by America’s renewal and the reemergence of American leadership. After one
year, the world knows that America is prosperous, America is secure, and America is strong. We will bring
about the better future we seek for our people and the world, by confronting the challenges and dangers

posed by those who seek to destabilize the world and threaten America’s people and interests.

My Administration’s National Security Strategy lays out a strategic vision for protecting the American
people and preserving our way of life, promoting our prosperity, preserving peace through strength,
and advancing American influence in the world. We will pursue this beautiful vision—a world
of strong, sovereign, and independent nations, each with its own cultures and dreams, thriving side-

by-side in prosperity, freedom, and peace—throughout the upcoming year.

In pursuit of that future, we will look at the world with clear eyes and fresh thinking. We will promote
a balance of power that favors the United States, our allies, and our partners. We will never lose sight of

our values and their capacity to inspire, uplift, and renew.

Most of all, we will serve the American people and uphold their right to a government that prioritizes

their security, their prosperity, and their interests. This National Security Strategy puts America First.

INTRODUCTION

An America that is safe, prosperous, and free at home is an America with the

strength, confidence, and will to lead abroad. It is an America that can pre-

serve peace, uphold liberty, and create enduring advantages for the American

people. Putting America first is the duty of our government and the foun-

dation for U.S. leadership in the world.

A strong America is in the vital interests of not only the American people, but

also those around the world who want to partner with the United States in

pursuit of shared interests, values, and aspirations.

This National Security Strategy puts America first.

n America First National Security

Strategy is based on American prin-

ciples, a clear-eyed assessment of U.S.
interests, and a determination to tackle the chal-
lenges that we face. It is a strategy of principled
realism that is guided by outcomes, not ideology.
It is based upon the view that peace, security, and
prosperity depend on strong, sovereign nations
that respect their citizens at home and cooper-
ate to advance peace abroad. And it is grounded
in the realization that American principles are

a lasting force for good in the world.
“We the People” is America’s source of strength.

The United States was born of a desire for life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness—and a convic-
tion that unaccountable political power is tyr-
anny. For these reasons, our Founders crafted and
ratified the Constitution, establishing the repub-
lican form of government we enjoy today. The
Constitution grants our national government not
only specified powers necessary to protect our
God-given rights and liberties but also safeguards

them by limiting the government’s size and scope,

separating Federal powers, and protecting the
rights of individuals through the rule of law. All
political power is ultimately delegated from, and

accountable to, the people.

We protect American sovereignty by defending
these institutions, traditions, and principles that
have allowed us to live in freedom, to build the nation
that we love. And we prize our national heritage, for
the rare and fragile institutions of republican gov-
ernment can only endure if they are sustained by a

culture that cherishes those institutions.

Liberty and independence have given us the flour-
ishing society Americans enjoy today—a vibrant
and confident Nation, welcoming of disagree-
ment and differences, but united by the bonds
of history, culture, beliefs, and principles that

define who we are.

We are proud of our roots and honor the wisdom of
the past. We are committed to protecting the rights
and dignity of every citizen. And we are a nation of
laws, because the rule of law is the shield that pro-

tects the individual from government corruption

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

and abuse of power, allows families to live with-

out fear, and permits markets to thrive.

Our founding principles have made the United
States of America among the greatest forces for
good in history. But we are also aware that we
must protect and build upon our accomplish-
ments, always conscious of the fact that the inter-
ests of the American people constitute our true
North Star.

America’s achievements and standing in the world
were neither inevitable nor accidental. On many
occasions, Americans have had to compete with
adversarial forces to preserve and advance our
security, prosperity, and the principles we hold
dear. At home, we fought the Civil War to end slay-
ery and preserve our Union in the long strug-
gle to extend equal rights for all Americans. In
the course of the bloodiest century in human his-
tory, millions of Americans fought, and hun-
dreds of thousands lost their lives, to defend lib-
erty in two World Wars and the Cold War. America,
with our allies and partners, defeated fascism,
imperialism, and Soviet communism and elimi-
nated any doubts about the power and durability
of republican democracy when it is sustained by

a free, proud, and unified people.

The United States consolidated its military
victories with political and economic triumphs
built on market economies and fair trade, dem-
ocratic principles, and shared security partner-
ships. American political, business, and military
leaders worked together with their counterparts
in Europe and Asia to shape the post-war order
through the United Nations, the Marshall Plan, the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and
other institutions designed to advance our shared
interests of security, freedom, and peace. We recog-
nize the invaluable advantages that our strong rela-

tionships with allies and partners deliver.

Following the remarkable victory of free nations in

the Cold War, America emerged as the lone super-

power with enormous advantages and momen-
tum in the world. Success, however, bred com-
placency. A belief emerged, among many, that
American power would be unchallenged and self-
sustaining. The United States began to drift. We
experienced a crisis of confidence and surren-
dered our advantages in key areas. As we took
our political, economic, and military advan-
tages for granted, other actors steadily imple-
mented their long-term plans to challenge America
and to advance agendas opposed to the United

States, our allies, and our partners.

We stood by while countries exploited the interna-
tional institutions we helped to build. They subsi-
dized their industries, forced technology transfers,
and distorted markets. These and other actions
challenged America’s economic security. At home,
excessive regulations and high taxes stifled growth
and weakened free enterprise—history’s great-
est antidote to poverty. Each time government
encroached on the productive activities of private
commerce, it threatened not only our prosperity
but also the spirit of creation and innovation that

has been key to our national greatness.

A Competitive World

The United States will respond to the growing
political, economic, and military competitions we

face around the world.

China and Russia challenge American power, influ-
ence, and interests, attempting to erode American
security and prosperity. They are determined to
make economies less free and less fair, to grow
their militaries, and to control information and
data to repress their societies and expand their
influence. At the same time, the dictatorships of
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the
Islamic Republic of Iran are determined to desta-
bilize regions, threaten Americans and our allies,

and brutalize their own people. Transnational

INTRODUCTION

 

threat groups, from jihadist terrorists to transna-
tional criminal organizations, are actively trying
to harm Americans. While these challenges dif:
fer in nature and magnitude, they are fundamen-
tally contests between those who value human
dignity and freedom and those who oppress

individuals and enforce uniformity.

These competitions require the United States
to rethink the policies of the past two decades—poli-
cies based on the assumption that engagement with
rivals and their inclusion in international insti-
tutions and global commerce would turn them
into benign actors and trustworthy partners. For

the most part, this premise turned out to be false.

Rival actors use propaganda and other means to try
to discredit democracy. They advance anti-Western
views and spread false information to create divi-
sions among ourselves, our allies, and our partners.
In addition, jihadist terrorists such as ISIS and
al-Qa’ida continue to spread a barbaric ideology
that calls for the violent destruction of governments
and innocents they consider to be apostates. These
jihadist terrorists attempt to force those under

their influence to submit to Sharia law.

America’s military remains the strongest in the
world. However, U.S. advantages are shrinking
as rival states modernize and build up their con-
ventional and nuclear forces. Many actors can
now field a broad arsenal of advanced missiles,
including variants that can reach the American
homeland. Access to technology empowers and
emboldens otherwise weak states. North Korea—a
country that starves its own people—has spent
hundreds of millions of dollars on nuclear, chem-
ical, and biological weapons that could threaten
our homeland. In addition, many actors have
become skilled at operating below the thresh-
old of military conflict—challenging the United
States, our allies, and our partners with hostile
actions cloaked in deniability. Our task is to ensure

that American military superiority endures, and

in combination with other elements of national
power, is ready to protect Americans against

sophisticated challenges to national security.

The contest over information accelerates these
political, economic, and military competitions.
Data, like energy, will shape U.S. economic prosper-
ity and our future strategic position in the world.
The ability to harness the power of data is fun-
damental to the continuing growth of America’s
economy, prevailing against hostile ideologies,
and building and deploying the most effective

military in the world.

We learned the difficult lesson that when America
does not lead, malign actors fill the void to the dis-
advantage of the United States. When America
does lead, however, from a position of strength
and confidence and in accordance with our inter-

ests and values, all benefit.

Competition does not always mean hostility, nor
does it inevitably lead to conflict—although none
should doubt our commitment to defend our inter-
ests. An America that successfully competes is the
best way to prevent conflict. Just as American weak-
ness invites challenge, American strength and con-

fidence deters war and promotes peace.

An America First
National Security Strategy

The competitions and rivalries facing the United
States are not passing trends or momentary prob-
lems. They are intertwined, long-term challenges
that demand our sustained national attention and

commitment.

America possesses unmatched political, eco-
nomic, military, and technological advantages.
But to maintain these advantages, build upon our
strengths, and unleash the talents of the American
people, we must protect four vital national inter-

ests in this competitive world.

 

©

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

First, our fundamental responsibility is to
protect the American people, the homeland,
and the American way of life. We will strengthen
control of our borders and reform our immigra-
tion system. We will protect our critical infrastruc-
ture and go after malicious cyber actors. A layered
missile defense system will defend our homeland
against missile attacks. And we will pursue threats
to their source, so that jihadist terrorists are

stopped before they ever reach our borders.

Second, we will promote American prosperity.
We will rejuvenate the American economy for
the benefit of American workers and companies.
We will insist upon fair and reciprocal economic
relationships to address trade imbalances. The
United States must preserve our lead in research
and technology and protect our economy from
competitors who unfairly acquire our intellec-
tual property. And we will embrace America’s
energy dominance because unleashing abundant
energy resources stimulates our economy.

Third, we will preserve peace through strength
by rebuilding our military so that it remains pre-
eminent, deters our adversaries, and if necessary,
is able to fight and win. We will compete with all
tools of national power to ensure that regions of
the world are not dominated by one power. We
will strengthen America’s capabilities—includ-
ing in space and cyberspace—and revitalize oth-
ers that have been neglected. Allies and partners
magnify our power. We expect them to shoul-
der a fair share of the burden of responsibil-

ity to protect against common threats.

Fourth, we will advance American influence
because a world that supports American inter-
ests and reflects our values makes America more
secure and prosperous. We will compete and lead
in multilateral organizations so that American
interests and principles are protected. America’s
commitment to liberty, democracy, and the rule of

law serves as an inspiration for those living under

tyranny. We can play a catalytic role in promoting
private-sector-led economic growth, helping aspir-
ing partners become future trading and security
partners. And we will remain a generous nation,

even as we expect others to share responsibility.

Strengthening our sovereignty—the first duty of
a government is to serve the interests of its own
people—is a necessary condition for protecting
these four national interests. And as we strengthen
our sovereignty we will renew confidence in our-
selves as a nation. We are proud of our history,
optimistic about America’s future, and confident
of the positive example the United States offers to
the world. We are also realistic and understand
that the American way of life cannot be imposed
upon others, nor is it the inevitable culmination
of progress. Together with our allies, partners,
and aspiring partners, the United States will pur-
sue cooperation with reciprocity. Cooperation
means sharing responsibilities and burdens.
In trade, fair and reciprocal relationships ben-
efit all with equal levels of market access and
opportunities for economic growth. An America
First National Security Strategy appreciates that
America will catalyze conditions to unleash eco-

nomic success for America and the world.

In the United States, free men and women have
created the most just and prosperous nation in
history. Our generation of Americans is now
charged with preserving and defending that
precious inheritance. This National Security

Strategy shows the way.

PILLAR I

PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,
THE HOMELAND, AND
THE AMERICAN Way OF LIFE

“We will defend our country, protect our communities,

and put the safety of the American people first.”

PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP

his National Security Strategy begins

with the determination to protect the

American people, the American way
of life, and American interests. Americans have
long recognized the benefits of an interconnected
world, where information and commerce flow
freely. Engaging with the world, however, does
not mean the United States should abandon its
rights and duties as a sovereign state or compro-
mise its security. Openness also imposes costs,
since adversaries exploit our free and demo-

cratic system to harm the United States.

North Korea seeks the capability to kill millions of
Americans with nuclear weapons. Iran supports
terrorist groups and openly calls for our destruc-
tion. Jihadist terrorist organizations such as ISIS
and al-Qa’ida are determined to attack the United
States and radicalize Americans with their hate-
ful ideology. Non-state actors undermine social
order through drug and human trafficking net-
works, which they use to commit violent crimes

and kill thousands of American each year.

Adversaries target sources of American strength,

including our democratic system and our econ-

JULY 2017

omy. They steal and exploit our intellectual prop-
erty and personal data, interfere in our political
processes, target our aviation and maritime sec-
tors, and hold our critical infrastructure at risk.
All of these actions threaten the foundations of
the American way of life. Reestablishing lawful
control of our borders is a first step toward pro-
tecting the American homeland and strengthen-

ing American sovereignty.

We must prevent nuclear, chemical, radiological,
and biological attacks, block terrorists from reach-
ing our homeland, reduce drug and human traf:
ficking, and protect our critical infrastructure.
We must also deter, disrupt, and defeat poten-
tial threats before they reach the United States.
We will target jihadist terrorists and transna-
tional criminal organizations at their source and

dismantle their networks of support.

We must also take steps to respond quickly to meet
the needs of the American people in the event of
natural disaster or attack on our homeland. We
must build a culture of preparedness and resilience
across our governmental functions, critical infra-

structure, and economic and political systems.

Secure U.S. Borders
and Territory

State and non-state actors place the safety of the
American people and the Nation’s economic
vitality at risk by exploiting vulnerabilities
across the land, air, maritime, space, and cyber-
space domains. Adversaries constantly evolve
their methods to threaten the United States and

our citizens. We must be agile and adaptable.

The danger from hostile state and non-state actors
who are trying to acquire nuclear, chemical, radio-

logical, and biological weapons is

 

increasing. The Syrian regime’s
use of chemical weapons against
its own citizens undermines
international norms against
these heinous weapons, which
may encourage more actors to
pursue and use them. ISIS has
used chemical weapons in Iraq
and Syria. Terrorist groups con-
tinue to pursue WMD-related
materials. We would face grave
danger if terrorists obtained
inadequately secured nuclear,

radiological, or biological material.

As missiles grow in numbers, types, and effec-
tiveness, to include those with greater ranges,
they are the most likely means for states like
North Korea to use a nuclear weapon against
the United States. North Korea is also pursuing
chemical and biological weapons which could
also be delivered by missile. China and Russia
are developing advanced weapons and capabil-
ities that could threaten our critical infrastruc-

ture and our command and control architecture.

Strengthening control
over our borders and
immigration system is
central to national security,
economic prosperity, and

the rule of law.

 

Priority Actions

ENHANCE MISSILE DEFENSE: The United States
is deploying a layered missile defense system
focused on North Korea and Iran to defend our
homeland against missile attacks. This system
will include the ability to defeat missile threats
prior to launch. Enhanced missile defense is
not intended to undermine strategic stabil-
ity or disrupt longstanding strategic relation-

ships with Russia or China.

DETECT AND DISRUPT WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION:
At our borders and within our territory, we will
bolster efforts to detect nuclear, chemical, radio-
logical, and biological agents and keep them from
being used against us. We will also better inte-
grate intelligence, law enforce-
ment, and emergency manage-
ment operations to ensure that
frontline defenders have the
right information and capabili-
ties to respond to WMD threats

from state and non-state actors.

ENHANCE COUNTERPROLIFERATION
MEASURES: Building on decades
of initiatives, we will aug-
ment measures to secure,
eliminate, and prevent the
spread of WMD and related
materials, their delivery sys-
tems, technologies, and knowledge to reduce
the chance that they might fall into the hands
of hostile actors. We will hold state and non-

state actors accountable for the use of WMD.

TARGET WMD TERRORISTS: We will direct coun-
terterrorism operations against terrorist WMD
specialists, financiers, administrators, and facilita-
tors. We will work with allies and partners to detect

and disrupt plots.

 

 

PILLAR I: PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE HOMELAND, AND THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE

 

Combat Biothreats and Pandemics

Biological incidents have the potential to cause
catastrophic loss of life. Biological threats to the
U.S. homeland—whether as the result of deliberate
attack, accident, or a natural outbreak—are growing

and require actions to address them at their source.

Naturally emerging outbreaks of viruses such as
Ebola and SARS, as well as the deliberate 2001
anthrax attacks in the United States, demon-
strated the impact of biological threats on national
security by taking lives, generating economic
losses, and contributing to a loss of confidence in

government institutions.

Advancements in life sciences that benefit our
health, economy, and society also open up new ave-
nues to actors who want to cause harm. Dedicated
state actors are likely to develop more advanced
bioweapons, and these capabilities may become

available to malicious non-state actors as well.

Priority Actions

DETECT AND CONTAIN BIOTHREATS AT THEIR SOURCE:
We will work with other countries to detect
and mitigate outbreaks early to prevent the
spread of disease. We will encourage other coun-
tries to invest in basic health care systems and
to strengthen global health security across the
intersection of human and animal health to pre-
vent infectious disease outbreaks. And we will
work with partners to ensure that laboratories
that handle dangerous pathogens have in place

safety and security measures.

SUPPORT BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION: We will protect
and support advancements in biomedical inno-
vation by strengthening the intellectual prop-
erty system that is the foundation of the biomedi-

cal industry.

IMPROVE EMERGENCY RESPONSE: At home, we will

strengthen our emergency response and uni-

fied coordination systems to rapidly character-
ize outbreaks, implement public health contain-
ment measures to limit the spread of disease,
and provide surge medical care—including

life-saving treatments.

Strengthen Border Control
and Immigration Policy

Strengthening control over our borders and
immigration system is central to national secu-
rity, economic prosperity, and the rule of law.
Terrorists, drug traffickers, and criminal car-
tels exploit porous borders and threaten U.S.
security and public safety. These actors adapt

quickly to outpace our defenses.

The United States affirms our sovereign right to
determine who should enter our country and
under what circumstances. The United States
understands the contributions immigrants have
made to our Nation throughout its history. Illegal
immigration, however, burdens the economy,
hurts American workers, presents public safety

risks, and enriches smugglers and other criminals.

The United States recognizes that decisions about
who to legally admit for residency, citizenship, or
otherwise are among the most important a coun-
try has to make. The United States will continue
to welcome lawful immigrants who do not pose
a security threat and whose entry is consistent
with the national interest, while at the same time
enhancing the screening and vetting of travelers,
closing dangerous loopholes, revising outdated
laws, and eliminating easily exploited vulnera-
bilities. We will also reform our current immi-
gration system, which, contrary to our national
interest and national security, allows for random-
ized entry and extended-family chain migration.
Residency and citizenship determinations should
be based on individuals’ merits and their ability
to positively contribute to U.S. society, rather than

chance or extended family connections.

Priority Actions

ENHANCE BORDER SECURITY: We will secure our
borders through the construction of a bor-
der wall, the use of multilayered defenses and
advanced technology, the employment of addi-
tional personnel, and other measures. The U.S.
Government will work with foreign partners to
deter, detect, and disrupt suspicious individuals

well before they enter the United States.

ENHANCE VETTING: The U.S. Government will
enhance vetting of prospective immigrants, ref:
ugees, and other foreign visitors to identify indi-
viduals who might pose a risk to national secu-
rity or public safety. We will set higher security
standards to ensure that we keep dangerous peo-
ple out of the United States and enhance our
information collection and analysis to identify

those who may already be within our borders.

ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAWS: We will enforce
immigration laws, both at the border and in the
interior, to provide an effective deterrent to illegal
immigration. The apprehension and swift removal
ofillegal aliens at the border is critical to an effective
border security strategy. We must also increase
efforts to identify and counter fraud in the immi-
gration process, which undermines the integrity
of our immigration system, exploits vulnerable

individuals, and creates national security risks.

BOLSTER TRANSPORTATION SECURITY: We will
improve information sharing across our gov-
ernment and with foreign partners to enhance
the security of the pathways through which peo-
ple and goods enter the country. We will invest in
technology to counter emerging threats to our avi-
ation, surface, and maritime transportation sec-
tors. We will also work with international and

industry partners to raise security standards.

Pursue Threats
to Their Source

There is no perfect defense against the range of
threats facing our homeland. That is why America
must, alongside allies and partners, stay on the
offensive against those violent non-state groups
that target the United States and our allies.

The primary transnational threats Americans face
are from jihadist terrorists and transnational crim-
inal organizations. Although their objectives differ,
these actors pose some common challenges. First,
they exploit our open society. Second, they often
operate in loose confederations and adapt rapidly.
Third, they rely on encrypted communication and
the dark web to evade detection as they plot, recruit,
finance, and execute their operations. Fourth, they
thrive under conditions of state weakness and prey
on the vulnerable as they accelerate the break-
down of rules to create havens from which to plan
and launch attacks on the United States, our allies,
and our partners. Fifth, some are sheltered and

supported by states and do their bidding.

Defeat Jihadist Terrorists

Jihadist terrorist organizations present the most
dangerous terrorist threat to the Nation. America,
alongside our allies and partners, is fighting a long
war against these fanatics who advance a totali-
tarian vision for a global Islamist caliphate that
justifies murder and slavery, promotes repres-
sion, and seeks to undermine the American way
of life. Jihadist terrorists use virtual and physical
networks around the world to radicalize isolated
individuals, exploit vulnerable populations, and

inspire and direct plots.

Even after the territorial defeat of ISIS and al-Qa’ida
in Syria and Iraq, the threat from jihadist terror-
ists will persist. They have used battlefields as test
beds of terror and have exported tools and tactics

to their followers. Many of these jihadist terror-

ists are likely to return to their home countries,
from which they can continue to plot and launch

attacks on the United States and our allies.

partners to deter and dis-

DISRUPT TERROR PLOTS: We will
enhance intelligence shar-
ing domestically and with for-

our frontline defenders—
including homeland secu-
rity, law enforcement, and intelligence profes-
sionals—the tools, authorities, and resources to

stop terrorist acts before they take place.

TAKE DIRECT ACTION: The U.S. military and other
operating agencies will take direct action against
terrorist networks and pursue terrorists who
threaten the homeland and U.S. citizens regard-
less of where they are. The campaigns against ISIS
and al-Qa’ida and their affiliates demonstrate that
the United States will enable partners and sus-
tain direct action campaigns to destroy terrorists
and their sources of support, making it harder for

them to plot against us.

ELIMINATE TERRORIST SAFE HAVENS: Time and ter-
ritory allow jihadist terrorists to plot, so we will
act against sanctuaries and prevent their reemer-
gence, before they can threaten the U.S. home-
land. We will go after their digital networks and
work with private industry to confront the chal-
lenge of terrorists and criminals “going dark” and

SEVER SOURCES OF STRENGTH: We will disrupt the
financial, materiel, and personnel supply chains of
terrorist organizations. We will sever their financ-
ing and protect the U.S. and international financial
systems from abuse. We will degrade their ability
to message and attract poten-
tial recruits. This includes
combating the evil ideology
of jihadists by exposing its
falsehoods, promoting count-
er-narratives, and amplify-

ing credible voices.

SHARE RESPONSIBILITY: Our
allies and partners, who are
also targets of terrorism, will
continue to share responsi-
bility in fighting these bar-
baric groups. We will help our

 

partners develop and respon-
sibly employ the capacity to
degrade and maintain persistent pressure against
terrorists and will encourage partners to work

independently of U.S. assistance.

COMBAT RADICALIZATION AND RECRUITMENT IN
COMMUNITIES: The United States rejects bigotry
and oppression and seeks a future built on our val-
ues as one American people. We will deny vio-
lent ideologies the space to take root by improving
trust among law enforcement, the private sector,
and American citizens. U.S. intelligence and home-
land security experts will work with law enforce-
ment and civic leaders on terrorism prevention and
provide accurate and actionable information about

radicalization in their communities.

Dismantle Transnational
Criminal Organizations

The United States must devote greater resources
to dismantle transnational criminal organiza-
tions (TCOs) and their subsidiary networks. Some

have established global supply chains that are

comparable to Fortune 500 corporations. Every
day they deliver drugs to American communities,
fuel gang violence, and engage in cybercrime. The
illicit opioid epidemic, fed by drug cartels as well
as Chinese fentanyl traffickers, kills tens of thou-
sands of Americans each year. These organizations
weaken our allies and partners too, by corrupting
and undermining democratic institutions. TCOs
are motivated by profit, power, and political influ-
ence. They exploit weak governance and enable
other national security threats, including terror-
ist organizations. In addition, some state adver-
saries use TCOs as instruments of national power,
offering them territorial sanctuary where they
are free to conduct unattributable cyber intru-

sions, sabotage, theft, and political subversion.

Priority Actions

IMPROVE STRATEGIC PLANNING AND INTELLIGENCE:
We will establish national-level strategic intelli-
gence and planning capabilities
to improve the ability of agen-
cies to work together to combat
TCOs at home and abroad.

DEFEND COMMUNITIES: We will
deny TCOs the ability to harm
Americans. We will support

substance use disorders for medical personnel.

DEFEND IN DEPTH: U.S. agencies and foreign
partners will target TCO leaders and their sup-
port infrastructure. We will assist countries, par-
ticularly in the Western Hemisphere, to break

the power of these organizations and networks.

COUNTER CYBER CRIMINALS: We will use sophisti-
cated investigative tools to disrupt the ability of
criminals to use online marketplaces, crypto-
currencies, and other tools for illicit activities.
The United States will hold countries accountable

for harboring these criminals.

Keep America Safe
in the Cyber Era

America’s response to the challenges and oppor-
tunities of the cyber era will determine our future
prosperity and security. For most of our history, the
United States has been able to protect the home-
land by controlling its land, air, space, and mari-
time domains. Today, cyberspace offers state and
non-state actors the ability to wage campaigns
against American political, economic, and secu-
rity interests without ever physically crossing
our borders. Cyberattacks offer adversaries low-
cost and deniable opportunities
to seriously damage or disrupt
critical infrastructure, cripple
American businesses, weaken
our Federal networks, and
attack the tools and devices that
Americans use every day to com-

municate and conduct business.

Critical infrastructure keeps our
food fresh, our houses warm,
our trade flowing, and our cit-
izens productive and safe. The
vulnerability of U.S. critical
infrastructure to cyber, phys-
ical, and electromagnetic attacks means that
adversaries could disrupt military command and
control, banking and financial operations, the elec-

trical grid, and means of communication.

Federal networks also face threats. These networks
allow government agencies to carry out vital func-

tions and provide services to the American peo-

ple. The government must do a better job of pro-
tecting data to safeguard information and the
privacy of the American people. Our Federal net-

works must be modernized and updated.

In addition, the daily lives of most Americans rely
on computer-driven and interconnected technolo-
gies. As our reliance on computers and connectiv-
ity increases, we become increasingly vulnerable
to cyberattacks. Businesses and individuals must

be able to operate securely in cyberspace.

Security was not a major consideration when the
Internet was designed and launched. As it evolves,
the government and private sector must design
systems that incorporate prevention, protec-
tion, and resiliency from the start, not as an after-
thought. We must do so ina way that respects free
markets, private competition, and the limited but
important role of government in enforcing the
rule of law. As we build the next generation of dig-
ital infrastructure, we have an opportunity to put

our experience into practice.

The Internet is an American invention, and it
should reflect our values as it continues to trans-
form the future for all nations and all genera-
tions. A strong, defensible cyber infrastructure
fosters economic growth, protects our liberties,

and advances our national security.

Priority Actions

IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE RISK: To improve the secu-
rity and resilience of our critical infrastruc-
ture, we will assess risk across six key areas:
national security, energy and power, banking and
finance, health and safety, communications, and
transportation. We will assess where cyberat-
tacks could have catastrophic or cascading con-
sequences and prioritize our protective efforts,

capabilities, and defenses accordingly.

BUILD DEFENSIBLE GOVERNMENT NETWORKS: We will
use the latest commercial capabilities, shared ser-
vices, and best practices to modernize our Federal
information technology. We will improve our abil-
ity to provide uninterrupted and secure communi-

cations and services under all conditions.

DETER AND DISRUPT MALICIOUS CYBER ACTORS:
The Federal Government will ensure that those
charged with securing critical infrastructure have
the necessary authorities, information, and capa-
bilities to prevent attacks before they affect or
hold at risk U.S. critical infrastructure. The United
States will impose swift and costly consequences
on foreign governments, criminals, and other
actors who undertake significant malicious cyber
activities. We will work with allies and friends to
expand our awareness of malicious activities. A
stronger and more resilient critical infrastructure
will strengthen deterrence by creating doubt in our

adversaries that they can achieve their objectives.

IMPROVE INFORMATION SHARING AND SENSING:
The U.S. Government will work with our critical
infrastructure partners to assess their informa-
tional needs and to reduce the barriers to informa-
tion sharing, such as speed and classification lev-
els. We will also invest in capabilities that improve
the ability of the United States to attribute cyber-
attacks. In accordance with the protection of civil
liberties and privacy, the U.S. Government will
expand collaboration with the private sector so that

we can better detect and attribute attacks.

DEPLOY LAYERED DEFENSES: Since threats transit
globally, passing through communications back-
bones without challenge, the U.S. Government will
work with the private sector to remediate known
bad activities at the network level to improve
the security of all customers. Malicious activ-
ity must be defeated within a network and not be

passed on to its destination whenever possible.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

Promote American
Resilience

Despite our best efforts, our government cannot
prevent all dangers to the American people. We
can, however, help Americans remain resilient in
the face of adversity. Resilience includes the abil-
ity to withstand and recover rapidly from delib-
erate attacks, accidents, natural disasters, as well
as unconventional stresses, shocks, and threats
to our economy and democratic system. In the
event of a disaster, Federal, state, and local agen-
cies must perform essential functions and have
plans in place to ensure the continuation of our

constitutional form of government.

Reducing risk and building more resilient com-
munities are the best ways to protect people, prop-
erty, and taxpayer dollars from loss and disrup-
tion. Through risk-informed investments, we will
build resilient communities and infrastructure

to protect and benefit future generations.

Should tragedy strike, the U.S. Government will
help communities recover and rebuild. Citizens
must be confident in our government, but also rec-
ognize that response and recovery begins with
individuals and local communities. In difficult
times, the true character of the American peo-
ple emerges: their strength, their love, and their
resolve. Our first responders selflessly run toward
danger, and volunteers rally to the aid of neigh-

bors when disaster strikes.

A democracy is only as resilient as its people. An
informed and engaged citizenry is the fundamen-
tal requirement for a free and resilient nation. For
generations, our society has protected free press,
free speech, and free thought. Today, actors such
as Russia are using information tools in an attempt
to undermine the legitimacy of democracies.
Adversaries target media, political processes, finan-
cial networks, and personal data. The American

public and private sectors must recognize this and

work together to defend our way of life. No exter-
nal threat can be allowed to shake our shared
commitment to our values, undermine our sys-

tem of government, or divide our Nation.

Priority Actions

IMPROVE RISK MANAGEMENT: The United States will
improve its ability to assess the threats and haz-
ards that pose the greatest risks to Americans
and will prioritize resources based on the high-

est risks.

BUILD A CULTURE OF PREPAREDNESS: This Admin-
istration will take steps to build a culture of pre-
paredness, informing and empowering commu-
nities and individuals to obtain the skills and
take the preparatory actions necessary to become
more resilient against the threats and hazards

that Americans face.

IMPROVE PLANNING: State and local governments
must conduct realistic exercises that test exist-
ing plans to make sure that they are sound and
can be executed. Agencies from all levels of gov-
ernment must coordinate better and apply lessons
learned from exercises to pinpoint the areas and

capabilities that require improvement.

INCENTIVIZE INFORMATION SHARING: To improve the
coordination among the private sector and all lev-
els of government that is needed to improve resil-
ience, we must make a stronger commitment to
protecting sensitive information so that all part-
ners actively identify and share vulnerabilities
and work collaboratively to reduce them.

 

 


 

 

PILLAR II

PROMOTE AMERICAN PROSPERITY

“Economic security is national security.”

PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP

strong economy protects the American
people, supports our way of life, and sus-
tains American power. American work-
ers thrive when they are free to innovate, develop
and access our abundant natural resources, and
operate in markets free from excessive regula-
tions and unfair foreign trade practices. A grow-
ing and innovative economy allows the United
States to maintain the world’s most powerful mili-

tary and protect our homeland.

We must rebuild our economic strength and
restore confidence in the American economic
model. Over decades, American factories, com-
panies, and jobs moved overseas. After the 2008
global financial crisis, doubt replaced confidence.
Riskaversion and regulations replaced investment
and entrepreneurship. The recovery produced ane-
mic growth in real earnings for American workers.
The U.S. trade deficit grew as a result of several fac-

tors, including unfair trading practices.

For 70 years, the United States has embraced a
strategy premised on the belief that leadership
of a stable international economic system rooted
in American principles of reciprocity, free mar-
kets, and free trade served our economic and
security interests. Working with our allies and
partners, the United States led the creation of
a group of financial institutions and other eco-
nomic forums that established equitable rules

and built instruments to stabilize the interna-

NOVEMBER 2017

tional economy and remove the points of friction

that had contributed to two world wars.

That economic system continues to serve our
interests, but it must be reformed to help American
workers prosper, protect our innovation,
and reflect the principles upon which that sys-
tem was founded. Trading partners and inter-
national institutions can do more to address
trade imbalances and adhere to and enforce the

rules of the order.

Today, American prosperity and security are
challenged by an economic competition play-
ing out in a broader strategic context. The United
States helped expand the liberal economic trad-
ing system to countries that did not share our val-
ues, in the hopes that these states would liber-
alize their economic and political practices and
provide commensurate benefits to the United
States. Experience shows that these countries dis-
torted and undermined key economic institu-
tions without undertaking significant reform of
their economies or politics. They espouse free trade
rhetoric and exploit its benefits, but only adhere

selectively to the rules and agreements.

We welcome all economic relationships rooted in
fairness, reciprocity, and faithful adherence to the
rules. Those who join this pursuit will be our clos-
est economic partners. But the United States will
no longer turn a blind eye to violations, cheating,

or economic aggression. We must work with like-

minded allies and partners to ensure our princi-
ples prevail and the rules are enforced so that our

economies prosper.

The United States will pursue

 

an economic strategy that reju-
venates the domestic economy,
benefits the American worker,
revitalizes the U.S. manufactur-
ing base, creates middle-class
jobs, encourages innovation, pre-
serves technological advantage,
safeguards the environment,
and achieves energy dominance.
Rebuilding economic strength
at home and preserving a fair
and reciprocal international
economic system will enhance
our security and advance pros-

perity and peace in the world.

Rejuvenate the
Domestic Economy

Economic challenges at home demand that we
understand economic prosperity as a pillar of
national security. Despite low unemployment
rates and stock market gains, overall economic
growth has, until recently, been anemic since
the 2008 recession. In the past five years, gross
domestic product (GDP) growth hovered barely
above two percent, and wages stagnated. Taxes
increased, and health insurance and prescrip-
tion drug costs continued to rise, albeit at a slower
pace. Education costs climbed at rates far above
inflation, increasing student debt. Productivity

growth fell to levels not seen in decades.

Significant government intrusion in the economy
slowed growth and job creation. Regulatory and
corporate tax policies incentivized businesses to
invest overseas and disadvantaged American com-

panies against foreign competitors. Excessive reg-

peace in the world.

 

ulation burdened small businesses. Banking regu-
lations squelched new bank formation and caused
hundreds of small banks to close. Regulation
decreased credit availability to
consumers and decreased prod-
uct choice. Excessive environ-
mental and infrastructure reg-
ulations impeded American
energy trade and the devel-
opment of new infrastruc-

ture projects.

Moreover, the poor state of our
physical infrastructure stulti-
fied the economy, reduced the
profitability of American small
businesses, and slowed the pro-
ductivity of American workers.
America’s digital infrastructure
also fell behind. Improvements
in bandwidth, better broadband connectiv-
ity, and protection from persistent cyberattacks
are needed to support America’s future growth.
Economic and personal transactions are depen-
dent upon the “.com world,” and wealth creation

depends on a reliable, secure Internet.

The Administration is dedicated to rejuvenat-
ing the U.S. economy, unleashing the potential of
all Americans, and restoring confidence in our
free market system. Promoting American pros-
perity makes America more secure and advances

American influence in the world.

Priority Actions

REDUCE REGULATORY BURDENS: Departments and
agencies will eliminate unnecessary regulations
that stifle growth, drive up costs for American busi-
nesses, impede research and development, dis-
courage hiring, and incentivize domestic busi-
nesses to move overseas. We will balance our
reduction in regulations with adequate protec-

tions and oversight.

 

 

PILLAR II: PROMOTE AMERICAN PROSPERITY

 

PROMOTE TAX REFORM: This Administration will
work with the Congress to create a simpler, fairer,
and pro-growth tax code that encourages the
creation of higher wage jobs and gives middle-
income families tax relief. Reduced business
tax rates and a territorial system for foreign sub-
sidiary earnings will improve the competitive-
ness of American companies and encourage their
return to the United States.

IMPROVE AMERICAN INFRASTRUCTURE: Federal, state,
and local governments will work together with pri-
vate industry to improve our airports, seaports
and waterways, roads and railways, transit sys-
tems, and telecommunications. The United States
will use our strategic advantage as a leading natu-
ral gas producer to transform transportation and
manufacturing. We will improve America’s digital
infrastructure by deploying a secure 5G Internet
capability nationwide. These improvements will
increase national competitiveness, benefit the envi-

ronment, and improve our quality of life.

REDUCE THE DEBT THROUGH FISCAL
RESPONSIBILITY: The national
debt, now over $20 trillion, pres-
ents a grave threat to America’s
long-term prosperity and, by
extension, our national security.
By restraining Federal spending,
making government more effi-
cient, and by modernizing our
tax system and making our busi-
nesses globally competitive, our
economy will grow and make the

existing debt more serviceable.

 

SUPPORT EDUCATION AND
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS:

We will support apprenticeships and work-
force development programs that pre-
pare American workers for high-wage
manufacturing and science, technology, engi-
neering, and mathematics (STEM) jobs of the
21st century.

 

The Administration is
dedicated to rejuvenating
the U.S. economy,
unleashing the potential
of all Americans, and
restoring confidence in our

free market system.

Promote Free, Fair,
and Reciprocal Economic
Relationships

For decades, the United States has allowed unfair
trading practices to grow. Other countries have
used dumping, discriminatory non-tariff barri-
ers, forced technology transfers, non-economic
capacity, industrial subsidies, and other support
from governments and state-owned enterprises to

gain economic advantages.

Today we must meet the challenge. We will address
persistent trade imbalances, break down trade
barriers, and provide Americans new opportuni-
ties to increase their exports. The United States
will expand trade that is fairer so that U.S. work-
ers and industries have more opportunities to
compete for business. We oppose closed mercan-
tilist trading blocks. By strengthening the inter-
national trading system and incentivizing other
countries to embrace mar-
ket-friendly policies, we can

enhance our prosperity.

The United States distinguishes
between economic competition
with countries that follow fair
and free market principles and
competition with those that act
with little regard for those prin-
ciples. We will compete with
like-minded states in the eco-
nomic domain—particularly
where trade imbalances exist—
while recognizing that compe-
tition is healthy when nations
share values and build fair and reciprocal rela-
tionships. The United States will pursue enforce-
ment actions when countries violate the rules
to gain unfair advantage. The United States will
engage industrialized democracies and other like-

minded states to defend against economic aggres-

Priority Actions

ADOPT NEW TRADE AND INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS
AND MODERNIZE EXISTING ONES: The United States
will pursue bilateral trade and investment agree-
ments with countries that commit to fair and recip-
rocal trade and will modernize existing agree-
ments to ensure they are consistent with those
principles. Agreements must adhere to high stan-
dards in intellectual property, digital trade, agri-

culture, labor, and the environment.

COUNTER UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES: The United
States will counter all unfair trade practices that
distort markets using all appropriate means,

from dialogue to enforcement tools.

COUNTER FOREIGN CORRUPTION: Using our eco-

continue to target corrupt foreign officials and
work with countries to improve their ability to
fight corruption so U.S. companies can compete

fairly in transparent business climates.

WORK WITH LIKE-MINDED PARTNERS: The United
States will work with like-minded partners to pre-
serve and modernize the rules of a fair and recip-
rocal economic order. Together we will emphasize
fair trade enforcement actions when necessary, as
well as multinational efforts to ensure transpar-
ency and adherence to international standards

within trade and investment projects.

FACILITATE NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES: The United
States will partner with countries as they build
their export markets, promote free market com-
petition, and incentivize private sector growth.
We will expand U.S. trade and investment oppor-
tunities and increase the market base for U.S.

goods and services.

Lead in Research, Technology,
Invention, and Innovation

The United States will build on the ingenuity
that has launched industries, created jobs, and
improved the quality of life at home and abroad.
To maintain our competitive advantage, the
United States will prioritize emerging technolo-
gies critical to economic growth and security, such
as data science, encryption, autonomous tech-
nologies, gene editing, new materials, nanotech-
nology, advanced computing technologies, and
artificial intelligence. From self-driving cars to
autonomous weapons, the field of artificial intelli-

gence, in particular, is progressing rapidly.

The United States must continue to attract the inno-
vative and the inventive, the brilliant and the bold.
We will encourage scientists in government, aca-
demia, and the private sector to achieve advance-
ments across the full spectrum of discovery, from
incremental improvements to game-changing
breakthroughs. We will nurture a healthy inno-
vation economy that collaborates with allies and
partners, improves STEM education, draws onan
advanced technical workforce, and invests in ear-

ly-stage research and development (R&D).

Priority Actions

UNDERSTAND WORLDWIDE SCIENCE AND TECH-
NOLOGY (S&T) TRENDS: To retain U.S. advantages
over our competitors, U.S. Government agencies
must improve their understanding of worldwide
S&T trends and how they are likely to influence—
or undermine—American strategies and programs.

ATTRACT AND RETAIN INVENTORS AND INNOVATORS:
The U.S. Government must improve our collab-
oration with industry and academia and our
recruitment of technical talent. We will remove
barriers to the full use of talent across Federal
agencies, and increase incentives for hiring and

retaining Federal STEM employees. Initiatives

 

PILLAR II: PROMOTE AMERICAN PROSPERITY

 

will include rapid hiring, swift adjudication of
national security clearances, and offers of com-
petitive salaries. We must create easier paths
for the flow of scientists, engineers, and technol-

ogists into and out of public service.

LEVERAGE PRIVATE CAPITAL AND EXPERTISE TO BUILD
AND INNOVATE: The U.S. Government will use pri-
vate sector technical expertise and R&D capabili-
ties more effectively. Private industry owns many
of the technologies that the government relies
upon for critical national security missions. The
Department of Defense and other agencies will
establish strategic partnerships with U.S. compa-
nies to help align private sector R&D resources to

priority national security applications.

RAPIDLY FIELD INVENTIONS AND INNOVATIONS: The
United States must regain the element of surprise
and field new technologies at the pace of mod-
ern industry. Government agencies must shift
from an archaic R&D process to an approach that

rewards rapid fielding and risk taking.

Promote and Protect
the U.S. National Security
Innovation Base

America’s business climate and legal and regu-
latory systems encourage risk taking. We area
nation of people who work hard, dream big, and
never give up. Not every country shares these
characteristics. Some instead steal or illicitly
acquire America’s hard-earned intellectual prop-
erty and proprietary information to compensate

for their own systemic weaknesses.

Every year, competitors such as China steal U.S.
intellectual property valued at hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars. Stealing proprietary technol-
ogy and early-stage ideas allows competitors to
unfairly tap into the innovation of free societ-

ies. Over the years, rivals have used sophisticated

means to weaken our businesses and our econ-
omy as facets of cyber-enabled economic war-
fare and other malicious activities. In addition to
these illegal means, some actors use largely legit-
imate, legal transfers and relationships to gain
access to fields, experts, and trusted foundries
that fill their capability gaps and erode America’s

long-term competitive advantages.

We must defend our National Security Innovation
Base (NSIB) against competitors. The NSIB is
the American network of knowledge, capabili-
ties, and people—including academia, National
Laboratories, and the private sector—that turns
ideas into innovations, transforms discoveries
into successful commercial products and com-
panies, and protects and enhances the American
way of life. The genius of creative Americans, and
the free system that enables them, is critical to

American security and prosperity.

Protecting the NSIB requires a domestic and inter-
national response beyond the scope of any indi-
vidual company, industry, university, or govern-
ment agency. The landscape of innovation does
not divide neatly into sectors. Technologies that
are part of most weapon systems often originate
in diverse businesses as well as in universities and
colleges. Losing our innovation and technologi-
cal edge would have far-reaching negative implica-

tions for American prosperity and power.

Priority Actions

UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES: The U.S. Government
will develop a capability to integrate, monitor, and
better understand the national security implica-
tions of unfair industry trends and the actions of
our rivals. We will explore new ways to share this
information with the private sector and academia
so they better understand their responsibilities in

curtailing activities that undercut America’s NSIB.

lic and private sector technology and technical
knowledge by hostile foreign competitors. While
maintaining an investor-friendly climate, this
Administration will work with the Congress to
strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment
in the United States (CFIUS) to ensure it addresses
current and future national
security risks. The United States
will prioritize counterintel-
ligence and law enforcement
activities to curtail intellectual
property theft by all sources
and will explore new legal and
regulatory mechanisms to pre-

vent and prosecute violations.

 

For the first time in
generations, the United
States will be an energy-

dominant nation.

that access to energy is diversified, and recognizes

the importance of environmental stewardship.

Access to domestic sources of clean, affordable,
and reliable energy underpins a prosperous,
secure, and powerful America for decades to come.
Unleashing these abundant
energy resources—coal, natural
gas, petroleum, renewables, and
nuclear—stimulates the econ-
omy and builds a foundation for
future growth. Our Nation must
take advantage of our wealth in
domestic resources and energy
efficiency to promote competi-

tiveness across our industries.

 

TIGHTEN VISA PROCEDURES:

The United States will review

visa procedures to reduce economic theft by
non-traditional intelligence collectors. We will
consider restrictions on foreign STEM stu-
dents from designated countries to ensure
that intellectual property is not transferred
to our competitors, while acknowledging the
importance of recruiting the most advanced tech-

nical workforce to the United States.

PROTECT DATA AND UNDERLYING INFRASTRUCTURE:
The United States will expand our focus beyond
protecting networks to protecting the data on
those networks so that it remains secure—both at
rest and in transit. To do this, the U.S. Government
will encourage practices across companies

and universities to defeat espionage and theft.

Embrace Energy Dominance

For the first time in generations, the United States
will be an energy-dominant nation. Energy dom-
inance—America’s central position in the global
energy systemasa leading producer, consumer, and
innovator—ensures that markets are free and U.S.

infrastructure is resilient and secure. It ensures

The United States also anchors

the North American energy sys-
tem, which is one of the most highly integrated in
the world. Our vibrant cross-border energy trade
and investment are vital for a robust and resilient
U.S. economy and energy market. We are com-
mitted to supporting energy initiatives that will
attract investments, safeguard the environment,
strengthen our energy security, and unlock the

enormous potential of our shared region.

Climate policies will continue to shape the global
energy system. U.S. leadership is indispensable
to countering an anti-growth energy agenda that
is detrimental to U.S. economic and energy secu-
rity interests. Given future global energy demand,
much of the developing world will require fossil
fuels, as well as other forms of energy, to power their
economies and lift their people out of poverty. The
United States will continue to advance an approach
that balances energy security, economic develop-
ment, and environmental protection. The United
States will remain a global leader in reducing tradi-
tional pollution, as well as greenhouse gases, while
expanding our economy. This achievement, which
can serve as a model to other countries, flows from
innovation, technology breakthroughs, and energy

efficiency gains, not from onerous regulation.

PILLAR II: PROMOTE AMERICAN PROSPERITY

 

As a growing supplier of energy resources, technol-
ogies, and services around the world, the United
States will help our allies and partners become
more resilient against those that use energy to
coerce. America’s role as an energy exporter will
also require an assessment of our vulnerabilities
and a resilient American infrastructure.

Finally, the Nation’s long-term energy security
future rests with our people. We must invest in our
future by supporting innovation and R&D, includ-
ing through the National Laboratories.

Priority Actions

REDUCE BARRIERS: The United States will promote
cleanand safe development of our energy resources,
while limiting regulatory burdens that encum-
ber energy production and constrain economic
growth. We will streamline the Federal regula-
tory approval processes for energy infrastructure,
from pipeline and export terminals to container
shipments and gathering lines, while also ensuring

responsible environmental stewardship.

PROMOTE ExpoRTS: The United States will pro-
mote exports of our energy resources, technolo-
gies, and services, which helps our allies and part-
ners diversify their energy sources and brings
economic gains back home. We will expand our
export capacity through the continued support of
private sector development of coastal terminals,
allowing increased market access and a greater

competitive edge for U.S. industries.

ENSURE ENERGY SECURITY: The United States will
work with allies and partners to protect global
energy infrastructure from cyber and physical
threats. The United States will support the diver-
sification of energy sources, supplies, and routes
at home and abroad. We will modernize our stra-
tegic petroleum stocks and encourage other
countries to develop their own—consistent with

their national energy security needs.

ATTAIN UNIVERSAL ENERGY ACCESS: The United
States will seek to ensure universal access to
affordable, reliable energy, including highly effi-
cient fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewables, to
help reduce poverty, foster economic growth,

and promote prosperity.

FURTHER AMERICA’S TECHNOLOGICAL EDGE: We will
improve America’s technological edge in energy,
including nuclear technology, next-generation
nuclear reactors, better batteries, advanced com-
puting, carbon-capture technologies, and opportu-
nities at the energy-water nexus. The United States
will continue to lead in innovative and efficient
energy technologies, recognizing the economic
and environmental benefits to end users.

PRESERVE PEACE
THROUGH STRENGTH

“As long as I am President, the servicemen and women who defend our

Nation will have the equipment, the resources, and the funding they need to

secure our homeland, to respond to our enemies quickly and decisively, and,

when necessary, to fight, to overpower, and to always, always, always win.”

PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP

central continuity in history is the con-

test for power. The present time period

is no different. Three main sets of chal-
lengers—the revisionist powers of China and
Russia, the rogue states of Iran and North Korea,
and transnational threat organizations, particu-
larly jihadist terrorist groups—are actively com-
peting against the United States and our allies
and partners. Although differing in nature and
magnitude, these rivals compete across politi-
cal, economic, and military arenas, and use tech-
nology and information to accelerate these con-
tests in order to shift regional balances of power
in their favor. These are fundamentally political
contests between those who favor repressive sys-

tems and those who favor free societies.

China and Russia want to shape a world antithetical
to U.S. values and interests. China seeks to displace
the United States in the Indo-Pacific region, expand
the reaches of its state-driven economic model,
and reorder the region in its favor. Russia seeks to
restore its great power status and establish spheres
of influence near its borders. The intentions of

both nations are not necessarily fixed. The United

DECEMBER 2017

States stands ready to cooperate across areas of

mutual interest with both countries.

For decades, U.S. policy was rooted in the belief
that support for China’s rise and for its integra-
tion into the post-war international order would
liberalize China. Contrary to our hopes, China
expanded its power at the expense of the sov-
ereignty of others. China gathers and exploits
data on an unrivaled scale and spreads features
of its authoritarian system, including corrup-
tion and the use of surveillance. It is building the
most capable and well-funded military in the
world, after our own. Its nuclear arsenal is grow-
ing and diversifying. Part of China’s military mod-
ernization and economic expansion is due to its
access to the U.S. innovation economy, includ-

ing America’s world-class universities.

Russia aims to weaken U.S. influence in the world
and divide us from our allies and partners. Russia
views the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) and European Union (EU) as threats. Russia
is investing in new military capabilities, includ-
ing nuclear systems that remain the most signifi-

cant existential threat to the United States, and in

 

®

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

destabilizing cyber capabilities. Through modern-
ized forms of subversive tactics, Russia interferes
in the domestic political affairs of countries around
the world. The combination of Russian ambition
and growing military capabilities creates an unsta-
ble frontier in Eurasia, where the risk of conflict

due to Russian miscalculation is growing.

The scourge of the world today is a small group of
rogue regimes that violate all principles of free
and civilized states. The Iranian regime spon-
sors terrorism around the world. It is developing
more capable ballistic missiles and has the poten-
tial to resume its work on nuclear weapons that
could threaten the United States and our part-
ners. North Korea is ruled as a ruthless dictator-
ship without regard for human dignity. For more
than 25 years, it has pursued nuclear weapons
and ballistic missiles in defiance of every commit-
ment it has made. Today, these missiles and weap-
ons threaten the United States and our allies. The
longer we ignore threats from countries deter-
mined to proliferate and develop weapons of mass
destruction, the worse such threats become, and

the fewer defensive options we have.

The United States continues to wage a long war
against jihadist terrorist groups such as ISIS and
al-Qa'ida. These groups are linked by a common
radical Islamist ideology that encourages vio-
lence against the United States and our partners
and produces misery for those under their control.
Although the United States and our partners have
inflicted defeats on ISIS and al-Qa’ida in Syria and
Iraq, these organizations maintain global reach
with established branches in strategic locations.
The threat from jihadist terrorists will persist,
even as we intensify efforts to prevent attacks on

Americans, our allies, and our partners.

Protecting American interests requires that we
compete continuously within and across these
contests, which are being played out in regions

around the world. The outcome of these con-

tests will influence the political, economic, and
military strength of the United States and our

allies and partners.

To prevail, we must integrate all elements of
America’s national power—political, economic, and
military. Our allies and partners must also con-
tribute the capabilities, and demonstrate the will,
to confront shared threats. Experience suggests
that the willingness of rivals to abandon or forgo
aggression depends on their perception of U.S.

strength and the vitality of our alliances.

The United States will seek areas of cooperation
with competitors from a position of strength, fore-
most by ensuring our military power is second
to none and fully integrated with our allies and
all of our instruments of power. A strong mili-
tary ensures that our diplomats are able to oper-
ate froma position of strength. In this way we can,
together with our allies and partners, deter and if
necessary, defeat aggression against U.S. interests
and increase the likelihood of managing competi-

tions without violent conflict and preserving peace.

Renew America’s
Competitive Advantages

The United States must consider what is endur-
ing about the problems we face, and what is new.
The contests over influence are timeless. They
have existed in varying degrees and levels of inten-
sity, for millennia. Geopolitics is the interplay of
these contests across the globe. But some condi-
tions are new, and have changed how these com-
petitions are unfolding. We face simultaneous
threats from different actors across multiple are-
nas—all accelerated by technology. The United
States must develop new concepts and capabili-
ties to protect our homeland, advance our pros-

perity, and preserve peace.

 

PILLAR III: PRESERVE PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH

 

Since the 1990s, the United States displayed a great
degree of strategic complacency. We assumed that
our military superiority was guaranteed and that
a democratic peace was inevitable. We believed
that liberal-democratic enlargement and inclu-
sion would fundamentally alter
the nature of international rela-
tions and that competition would

give way to peaceful cooperation.

Instead of building mili-
tary capacity, as threats to our
national security increased,
the United States dramatically
cut the size of our military to
the lowest levels since 1940.
Instead of developing import-
ant capabilities, the Joint Force
entered a nearly decade long
“procurement holiday” during

which the acquisition of new

 

weapon systems was severely
limited. The breakdown of the
Nation’s annual Federal budgeting process, exem-
plified by sequestration and repeated continu-
ing resolutions, further contributed to the ero-
sion of America’s military dominance during a

time of increasing threats.

Despite decades of efforts to reform the way that
the United States develops and procures new weap-
ons, our acquisition system remained sclerotic.
The Joint Force did not keep pace with emerg-
ing threats or technologies. We got less for our
defense dollars, shortchanging American tax-

payers and warfighters.

We also incorrectly believed that technology could
compensate for our reduced capacity—for the abil-
ity to field enough forces to prevail militarily, con-
solidate our gains, and achieve our desired polit-
ical ends. We convinced ourselves that all wars
would be fought and won quickly, from stand-off

distances and with minimal casualties.

 

The United States will seek
areas of cooperation with
competitors from a position
of strength, foremost by
ensuring our military
power is second to none
and fully integrated with
our allies and all of our

instruments of power.

In addition, after being dismissed as a phenom-
enon of an earlier century, great power competi-
tion returned. China and Russia began to reassert
their influence regionally and globally. Today, they
are fielding military capabilities designed to deny
America access in times of cri-
sis and to contest our ability to
operate freely in critical com-
mercial zones during peacetime.
In short, they are contesting our
geopolitical advantages and try-
ing to change the international

order in their favor.

Moreover, deterrence today
is significantly more com-
plex to achieve than during the
Cold War. Adversaries stud-
ied the American way of war
and began investing in capabil-
ities that targeted our strengths
and sought to exploit perceived
weaknesses. The spread of accu-
rate and inexpensive weap-
ons and the use of cyber tools have allowed state
and non-state competitors to harm the United
States across various domains. Such capabili-
ties contest what was until recently U.S. domi-
nance across the land, air, maritime, space, and
cyberspace domains. They also enable adversar-
ies to attempt strategic attacks against the United
States—without resorting to nuclear weapons—in
ways that could cripple our economy and our abil-
ity to deploy our military forces. Deterrence must
be extended across all of these domains and must

address all possible strategic attacks.

In addition, adversaries and competitors became
adept at operating below the threshold of open
military conflict and at the edges of interna-
tional law. Repressive, closed states and orga-
nizations, although brittle in many ways, are
often more agile and faster at integrating eco-

nomic, military, and especially informational

 

@

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

means to achieve their goals. They are unencum-
bered by truth, by the rules and protections of pri-
vacy inherent in democracies, and by the law of
armed conflict. They employ sophisticated politi-
cal, economic, and military campaigns that com-
bine discrete actions. They are patient and con-
tent to accrue strategic gains over time—making
it harder for the United States and our allies to
respond. Such actions are calculated to achieve
maximum effect without provoking a direct mil-
itary response from the United States. And as
these incremental gains are realized, over time,

a new status quo emerges.

The United States must prepare for this type of com-
petition. China, Russia, and other state and non-
state actors recognize that the United States often
views the world in binary terms, with states being
either “at peace” or “at war,” when it is actually an
arena of continuous competition. Our adversar-
ies will not fight us on our terms. We will raise our
competitive game to meet that challenge, to pro-

tect American interests, and to advance our values.

Our diplomatic, intelligence, military, and eco-
nomic agencies have not kept pace with the changes
in the character of competition. America’s mili-
tary must be prepared to operate across a full spec-
trum of conflict, across multiple domains at once.
To meet these challenges we must also upgrade
our political and economic instruments to operate

across these environments.

Bureaucratic inertia is powerful. But so is the tal-
ent, creativity, and dedication of Americans. By
aligning our public and private sector efforts we
can field a Joint Force that is unmatched. New
advances in computing, autonomy, and manufac-
turing are already transforming the way we fight.
When coupled with the strength of our allies and
partners, this advantage grows. The future that
we face is ours to win or lose. History suggests
that Americans will rise to the occasion and that
we can shift trends back in favor of the United

States, our allies, and our partners.

Renew Capabilities

Given the new features of the geopolitical envi-
ronment, the United States must renew key capa-

bilities to address the challenges we face.

Military

U.S. military strength remains a vital compo-
nent of the competition for influence. The Joint
Force demonstrates U.S. resolve and commit-
ment and provides us with the ability to fight
and win across any plausible conflict that threat-

ens U.S. vital interests.

The United States must retain overmatch—
the combination of capabilities in sufficient
scale to prevent enemy success and to ensure
that America’s sons and daughters will never
be ina fair fight. Overmatch strengthens our
diplomacy and permits us to shape the inter-
national environment to protect our interests.
To retain military overmatch the United States
must restore our ability to produce innovative
capabilities, restore the readiness of our forces for
major war, and grow the size of the force so that it
is capable of operating at sufficient scale and for

ample duration to win across a range of scenarios.

We must convince adversaries that we can and
will defeat them—not just punish them if they
attack the United States. We must ensure the abil-
ity to deter potential enemies by denial, convinc-
ing them that they cannot accomplish objectives
through the use of force or other forms of aggres-
sion. We need our allies to do the same—to modern-
ize, acquire necessary capabilities, improve read-
iness, expand the size of their forces, and affirm

the political will to win.

 

PILLAR III: PRESERVE PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH

 

Priority Actions

MODERNIZATION: Ensuring that the U.S. military
can defeat our adversaries requires weapon sys-
tems that clearly overmatch theirs in lethality.
Where possible, we must improve existing systems
to maximize returns on prior investments. In other
areas we should seek new capa-
bilities that create clear advan-
tages for our military while
posing costly dilemmas for our
adversaries. We must elimi-
nate bureaucratic impediments
to innovation and embrace less
expensive and time-intensive
commercial off-the-shelf solu-
tions. Departments and agen-
cies must work with industry to
experiment, prototype, and rap-
idly field new capabilities that
can be easily upgraded as new

technologies come online.

ACQUISITION: The United States will pursue new
approaches to acquisition to make better deals
on behalf of the American people that avoid
cost overruns, eliminate bloated bureaucra-
cies, and stop unnecessary delays so that we can
put the right equipment into the hands of our
forces. We must harness innovative technolo-
gies that are being developed outside of the tradi-

tional defense industrial base.

capacity: The size of our force matters. To deter
conflict and, if deterrence fails, to win in war,
the Nation must be able to field forces capa-
ble of operating in sufficient scale and for ample
duration to defeat enemies, consolidate mili-
tary gains, and achieve sustainable outcomes
that protect the American people and our vital
interests. The United States must reverse recent
decisions to reduce the size of the Joint Force
and grow the force while modernizing and

ensuring readiness.

Support for a vibrant
domestic manufacturing
sector, a solid defense
industrial base, and
resilient supply chains

is a national priority.

IMPROVE READINESS: The United States must retain
a ready force that is capable of protecting the home-
land while defending U.S. interests. Readiness
requires a renewed focus on training, logistics,
and maintenance. We must be able to get to a the-
ater in time to shape events quickly. This will
require a resilient forward posture and agile

global mobility forces.

 

RETAIN A FULL-SPECTRUM FORCE:
The Joint Force must remain
capable of deterring and defeat-
ing the full range of threats to the
United States. The Department
of Defense must develop new
operational concepts and capa-
bilities to win without assured
dominance in air, maritime,
land, space, and cyberspace

domains, including against

 

those operating below the level
of conventional military con-
flict. We must sustain our competence in irregu-
lar warfare, which requires planning for a long-
term, rather than ad hoc, fight against terrorist

networks and other irregular threats.

Defense Industrial Base

A healthy defense industrial base is a critical ele-
ment of U.S. power and the National Security
Innovation Base. The ability of the military to
surge in response to an emergency depends on
our Nation’s ability to produce needed parts and
systems, healthy and secure supply chains, anda
skilled U.S. workforce. The erosion of American
manufacturing over the last two decades, how-
ever, has had a negative impact on these capa-
bilities and threatens to undermine the ability
of U.S. manufacturers to meet national security
requirements. Today, we rely on single domes-
tic sources for some products and foreign supply
chains for others, and we face the possibility of not

being able to produce specialized components for

 

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

the military at home. As America’s manufactur-
ing base has weakened, so too have critical work-
force skills ranging from industrial welding, to
high-technology skills for cybersecurity and aero-
space. Support for a vibrant domestic manufactur-
ing sector, a solid defense industrial base, and resil-

ient supply chains is a national priority.

Priority Actions

UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM: We will evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of our defense indus-
trial base, including the identification of materi-
als essential to national security, contingencies
that could affect supply chains, and technologies

that are likely to be critical for the future.

ENCOURAGE HOMELAND INVESTMENT: The United
States will promote policies and incentives
that return key national security industries
to American shores. Where possible, the U.S.
Government will work with industry partners to
strengthen U.S. competitiveness in key technolo-
gies and manufacturing capabilities. In addition,
we will reform regulations and processes to facili-

tate the export of U.S. military equipment.

PROTECT AND GROW CRITICAL SKILLS: The United
States must maintain and develop skilled trades
and high-technology skills through increased
support for technical college and apprentice-
ship programs. We will support STEM efforts,
at the Federal and state levels, and target national

security technology areas.

Nuclear Forces

Nuclear weapons have served a vital purpose in
America’s National Security Strategy for the past
70 years. They are the foundation of our strat-
egy to preserve peace and stability by deterring
aggression against the United States, our allies,
and our partners. While nuclear deterrence strat-

egies cannot prevent all conflict, they are essen-

tial to prevent nuclear attack, non-nuclear strategic
attacks, and large-scale conventional aggression.
In addition, the extension of the U.S. nuclear deter-
rent to more than 30 allies and partners helps to
assure their security, and reduces their need to

possess their own nuclear capabilities.

Following the Cold War, the United States reduced
investments in our nuclear enterprise and reduced
the role of nuclear weapons in our strategy. Some
parts of America’s strategic nuclear Triad of bomb-
ers, sea-based missiles, and land-based missiles are
over 30 years old, and much of our nuclear infra-
structure dates to the World War II era. At the same
time, however, nuclear-armed adversaries have
expanded their arsenals and range of delivery sys-
tems. The United States must maintain the credi-
ble deterrence and assurance capabilities provided
by our nuclear Triad and by U.S. theater nuclear
capabilities deployed abroad. Significant invest-
ment is needed to maintain a U.S. nuclear arsenal
and infrastructure that is able to meet national

security threats over the coming decades.

Priority Actions

SUSTAIN U.S. NUCLEAR WEAPONS: The United States
will sustain a nuclear force structure that meets
our current needs and addresses unanticipated
risks. The United States does not need to match
the nuclear arsenals of other powers, but we must
sustain a stockpile that can deter adversaries,
assure allies and partners, and achieve U.S. objec-

tives if deterrence fails.

MODERNIZE U.S. NUCLEAR FORCES AND INFRA-
STRUCTURE: We will modernize our nuclear enter-
prise to ensure that we have the scientific, engi-
neering, and manufacturing capabilities nec-
essary to retain an effective and safe nuclear
Triad and respond to future national secu-
rity threats. Modernization and sustainment
require investing in our aging command and

control system and maintaining and growing

 

PILLAR III: PRESERVE PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH

 

the highly skilled workforce needed to develop,

manufacture, and deploy nuclear weapons.

MAINTAIN STABLE DETERRENCE: To avoid miscalcu-
lation, the United States will conduct discussions
with other states to build predictable relation-
ships and reduce nuclear risks. We will consider
new arms control arrangements if they contribute
to strategic stability and if they are verifiable. We
will not allow adversaries to use threats of nuclear
escalation or other irresponsible nuclear behav-
iors to coerce the United States, our allies, and
our partners. Fear of escalation will not prevent
the United States from defending our vital inter-

ests and those of our allies and partners.

Space

The United States must maintain our leadership
and freedom of action in space. Communications
and financial networks, military and intelligence
systems, weather monitoring, navigation, and
more have components in the space domain. As
U.S. dependence on space has increased, other
actors have gained access to space-based systems
and information. Governments and private sector
firms have the ability to launch satellites into space
at increasingly lower costs. The fusion of data from
imagery, communications, and geolocation ser-
vices allows motivated actors to access previously
unavailable information. This “democratization of
space” has an impact on military operations and

on America’s ability to prevail in conflict.

Many countries are purchasing satellites to sup-
port their own strategic military activities. Others
believe that the ability to attack space assets offers
an asymmetric advantage and as a result, are pur-
suing a range of anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons.
The United States considers unfettered access to
and freedom to operate in space to be a vital inter-
est. Any harmful interference with or an attack
upon critical components of our space archi-

tecture that directly affects this vital U.S. inter-

est will be met with a deliberate response at a

time, place, manner, and domain of our choosing.

Priority Actions

ADVANCE SPACE AS A PRIORITY DOMAIN: America’s
newly re-established National Space Council,
chaired by the Vice President, will review America’s
long-range space goals and develop a strategy that
integrates all space sectors to support innova-

tion and American leadership in space.

PROMOTE SPACE COMMERCE: The United States will
simplify and update regulations for commer-
cial space activity to strengthen competitiveness.
As the U.S. Government partners with U.S. com-
mercial space capabilities to improve the resil-
iency of our space architecture, we will also con-
sider extending national security protections to

our private sector partners as needed.

MAINTAIN LEAD IN EXPLORATION: To enable human
exploration across the solar system and to bring
back to Earth new knowledge and opportuni-
ties, we will increase public-private partnerships
and promote ventures beyond low Earth orbit

with allies and friends.

Cyberspace

Malicious state and non-state actors use cyberat-
tacks for extortion, information warfare, disinfor-
mation, and more. Such attacks have the capability
to harm large numbers of people and institutions
with comparatively minimal investment anda
troubling degree of deniability. These attacks can
undermine faith and confidence in democratic

institutions and the global economic system.

Many countries now view cyber capabilities
as tools for projecting influence, and some use
cyber tools to protect and extend their autocratic
regimes. Cyberattacks have become a key feature

of modern conflict. The United States will deter,

defend, and when necessary defeat malicious
actors who use cyberspace capabilities against the
United States. When faced with the opportunity
to take action against malicious actors in cyber-
space, the United States will be risk informed, but

not risk averse, in considering our options.

Priority Actions

IMPROVE ATTRIBUTION, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND
RESPONSE: We will invest in capabilities to sup-
port and improve our ability to attribute cyber-

attacks, to allow for rapid response.

ENHANCE CYBER TOOLS AND EXPERTISE: We will
improve our cyber tools across the spectrum of
conflict to protect U.S. Government assets and
U.S. critical infrastructure, and to protect the
integrity of data and information. U.S. depart-
ments and agencies will recruit, train, and
retain a workforce capable of operating across

this spectrum of activity.

IMPROVE INTEGRATION AND AGILITY: We will
improve the integration of authorities and pro-
cedures across the U.S. Government so that
cyber operations against adversaries can be
conducted as required. We will work with the
Congress to address the challenges that continue
to hinder timely intelligence and information
sharing, planning and operations, and the devel-

opment of necessary cyber tools.

Intelligence

America’s ability to identify and respond to geo-
strategic and regional shifts and their political, eco-
nomic, military, and security implications requires
that the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) gather,
analyze, discern, and operationalize information.
In this information-dominant era, the IC must con-
tinuously pursue strategic intelligence to antic-
ipate geostrategic shifts, as well as shorter-term
intelligence so that the United States can respond

to the actions and provocations of rivals.

The ability of the United States to modernize
our military forces to overmatch our adversar-
ies requires intelligence support. Intelligence is
needed to understand and anticipate foreign doc-
trine and the intent of foreign leaders, prevent tac-
tical and operational surprise, and ensure that
U.S. capabilities are not compromised before
they are fielded. In addition, virtually all mod-
ern weapon systems depend upon data derived

from scientific and technical intelligence.

The IC, as well as the law enforcement community,
offer unique abilities to defend against and miti-
gate threat actors operating below the threshold of
open conflict. Both communities have exception-
ally strong liaison relationships throughout the
world, allowing the United States to cooperate with

allies and partners to protect against adversaries.

Priority Actions

IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING: To prevent the theft of
sensitive and proprietary information and main-
tain supply chain integrity, the United States must
increase our understanding of the economic pol-
icy priorities of our adversaries and improve
our ability to detect and defeat their attempts to

commit economic espionage.

HARNESS ALL INFORMATION AT OUR DISPOSAL: The
United States will, in concert with allies and part-
ners, use the information-rich open-source envi-
ronment to deny the ability of state and non-state
actors to attack our citizens, conduct offensive
intelligence activities, and degrade America’s

democratic institutions.

FUSE INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS: The United States
will fuse our analysis of information derived from
the diplomatic, information, military, and eco-
nomic domains to compete more effectively on

the geopolitical stage.

Diplomacy and Statecraft

Competitive Diplomacy

Across the competitive landscape, America’s dip-
lomats are our forward-deployed political capa-
bility, advancing and defending America’s inter-
ests abroad. Diplomacy catalyzes the political,
economic, and societal connections that create
America’s enduring alignments and that build
positive networks of rela-
tionships with partners.
Diplomacy sustains dia-
logue and fosters areas of
cooperation with compet-
itors. It reduces the risk of

costly miscommunication.

to conflicts in unstable regions

involvement. It helps to galvanize

allies for action and marshal the

collective resources of like-minded
nations and organizations

to address shared problems.

Priority Actions

PRESERVE A FORWARD DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE: Our
diplomats must be able to build and sustain rela-
tionships where U.S. interests are at stake. Face-
to-face diplomacy cannot be replaced by tech-
nology. Relationships, developed over time,
create trust and shared understanding that the
United States calls upon when confronting secu-
rity threats, responding to crises, and encour-
aging others to share the
burden for tackling the
world’s challenges. We must
enable forward-deployed
field work beyond the con-
fines of diplomatic facilities,
including partnering with
military colleagues in con-

flict-affected states.

ADVANCE AMERICAN INTERESTS:
In the ongoing contests
for power, our diplomats
must build and lead coali-
tions that advance shared

interests and articulate

 

resources of like-minded
nations and organiza-
tions to address shared problems. Authoritarian
states are eager to replace the United States
where the United States withdraws our diplo-

mats and closes our outposts.

We must upgrade our diplomatic capabili-
ties to compete in the current environment and
to embrace a competitive mindset. Effective
diplomacy requires the efficient use of limited
resources, a professional diplomatic corps, modern
and safe facilities, and secure methods to commu-

nicate and engage with local populations.

America’s vision in interna-
tional forums, in bilateral
relationships, and at local levels within states.
Our diplomats need additional flexibility to oper-

ate in complex conflict-affected areas.

CATALYZE OPPORTUNITIES: Diplomats must iden-
tify opportunities for commerce and coop-
eration, and facilitate the cultural, educa-
tional, and people-to-people exchanges that
create the networks of current and future polit-
ical, civil society, and educational leaders who

will extend a free and prosperous world.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

Tools of Economic Diplomacy

Retaining our position as the world’s preemi-
nent economic actor strengthens our ability to
use the tools of economic diplomacy for the good
of Americans and others. Maintaining America’s
central role in international financial forums
enhances our security and prosperity by expand-
ing acommunity of free market economies, defend-
ing against threats from state-led economies, and
protecting the U.S. and international economy

from abuse by illicit actors.

We want to create wealth for Americans and our
allies and partners. Prosperous states are stron-
ger security partners who are able to share the
burden of confronting com-

mon threats. Fair and recip-

 

rocal trade, investments, and
exchanges of knowledge deepen
our alliances and partnerships,
which are necessary to succeed
in today’s competitive geopoliti-
cal environment. Trade, export
promotion, targeted use of for-
eign assistance, and modern-
ized development finance tools
can promote stability, prosper-
ity, and political reform, and
build new partnerships based

on the principle of reciprocity.

Economic tools—including sanctions, anti-mon-
ey-laundering and anti-corruption measures, and
enforcement actions—can be important parts of
broader strategies to deter, coerce, and constrain
adversaries. We will work with like-minded part-
ners to build support for tools of economic diplo-
macy against shared threats. Multilateral eco-
nomic pressure is often more effective because it
limits the ability of targeted states to circumvent

measures and conveys united resolve.

institutions that underpin
free societies, while
shielding themselves from

outside information.

 

Priority Actions

REINFORCE ECONOMIC TIES WITH ALLIES AND
PARTNERS: We will strengthen economic ties as a
core aspect of our relationships with like-minded
states and use our economic expertise, mar-
kets, and resources to bolster states threatened

by our competitors.

DEPLOY ECONOMIC PRESSURE ON SECURITY THREATS:
We will use existing and pursue new economic
authorities and mobilize international actors
to increase pressure on threats to peace and
security in order to resolve confrontations short

of military action.

SEVER SOURCES OF FUNDING: We will deny reve-
nue to terrorists, WMD proliferators, and other
illicit actors in order to constrain
their ability to use and move
funds to support hostile acts

and operations.

weaponize information

Information Statecraft

America’s competitors weap-
onize information to attack the
values and institutions that
underpin free societies, while
shielding themselves from out-
side information. They exploit
marketing techniques to tar-
get individuals based upon
their activities, interests,
opinions, and values. They disseminate mis-

information and propaganda.

Risks to U.S. national security will grow as com-
petitors integrate information derived from per-
sonal and commercial sources with intelligence
collection and data analytic capabilities based
on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learn-
ing. Breaches of U.S. commercial and govern-
ment organizations also provide adversaries with

data and insights into their target audiences.

 

PILLAR III: PRESERVE PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH

 

China, for example, combines data and the use of AI
to rate the loyalty of its citizens to the state and uses
these ratings to determine jobs and more. Jihadist
terrorist groups continue to wage ideological infor-
mation campaigns to establish and legitimize their
narrative of hate, using sophisticated communica-
tions tools to attract recruits and encourage attacks

against Americans and our partners.

Russia uses information operations as part of its
offensive cyber efforts to influence public opin-
ion across the globe. Its influence campaigns blend
covert intelligence operations and false online per-
sonas with state-funded media, third-party inter-

mediaries, and paid social media users or “trolls.”

U.S. efforts to counter the exploitation of informa-
tion by rivals have been tepid and fragmented. U.S.
efforts have lacked a sustained focus and have been
hampered by the lack of properly trained profes-
sionals. The American private sector has a direct
interest in supporting and amplifying voices

that stand for tolerance, openness, and freedom.

Priority Actions

PRIORITIZE THE COMPETITION: We will improve
our understanding of how adversaries gain infor-
mational and psychological advantages across
all policies. The United States must empower
a true public diplomacy capability to compete

effectively in this arena.

DRIVE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATIONS: We will craft
and direct coherent communications campaigns
to advance American influence and counter chal-
lenges from the ideological threats that ema-
nate from radical Islamist groups and competitor
nations. These campaigns will adhere to American
values and expose adversary propaganda and

disinformation.

ACTIVATE LOCAL NETWORKS: Local voices are most
compelling and effective in ideological competi-
tions. We must amplify credible voices and part-
ner with them to advance alternatives to violent
and hateful messages. Since media and Internet
companies are the platforms through which mes-
sages are transported, the private sector should
lend its creativity and resources to promot-
ing the values that inspire and grow a commu-

nity of civilized groups and individuals.

SHARE RESPONSIBILITY: The United States will
urge states where radicalism thrives to take
greater responsibility for countering violent
messaging and promoting tolerant and pluralis-

tic worldviews.

UPGRADE, TAILOR, AND INNOVATE: We will
reexamine legacy delivery platforms for com-
municating U.S. messages overseas. We must
consider more cost-effective and efficient ways
to deliver and evaluate content consistent with

U.S. national security interests.

PILLAR IV

ADVANCE AMERICAN INFLUENCE

“Above all, we value the dignity of every human life,

protect the rights of every person,

and share the hope of every soul

to live in freedom. That is who we are.”

PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP

ur America First foreign policy cel-
ebrates America’s influence in the
world as a positive force that can help
set the conditions for peace and prosperity and

for developing successful societies.

There is no arc ofhistory that ensures that America’s
free political and economic system will automati-
cally prevail. Success or failure depends upon our
actions. This Administration has the confidence
to compete to protect our values and interests and

the fundamental principles that underpin them.

During the Cold War, a totalitarian threat from
the Soviet Union motivated the free world to cre-
ate coalitions in defense of liberty. Today’s chal-
lenges to free societies are just as serious, but
more diverse. State and non-state actors proj-
ect influence and advance their objectives by
exploiting information, democratic media free-
doms, and international institutions. Repressive
leaders often collaborate to subvert free societies

and corrupt multilateral organizations.

Around the world, nations and individuals admire
what America stands for. We treat people equally
and value and uphold the rule of law. We have
a democratic system that allows the best ideas
to flourish. We know how to grow economies so

that individuals can achieve prosperity. These

JULY 2017

qualities have made America the richest coun-
try on earth-rich in culture, talent, opportuni-

ties, and material wealth.

The United States offers partnership to those who
share our aspirations for freedom and prosperity.
We lead by example. “The world has its eye upon
America,"" Alexander Hamilton once observed. “The
noble struggle we have made in the cause of liberty,
has occasioned a kind of revolution in human sen-
timent. The influence of our example has pene-

trated the gloomy regions of despotism.”

We are not going to impose our values on oth-
ers. Our alliances, partnerships, and coalitions
are built on free will and shared interests. When
the United States partners with other states, we
develop policies that enable us to achieve our

goals while our partners achieve theirs.

Allies and partners are a great strength of the
United States. They add directly to U.S. politi-
cal, economic, military, intelligence, and other
capabilities. Together, the United States and our
allies and partners represent well over half of
the global GDP. None of our adversaries have

comparable coalitions.

We encourage those who want to join our com-

munity of like-minded democratic states and

 

@

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

improve the condition of their peoples. By mod-
ernizing U.S. instruments of diplomacy and devel-
opment, we will catalyze conditions to help them
achieve that goal. These aspiring partners include
states that are fragile, recovering from conflict,
and seeking a path forward to
sustainable security and eco-
nomic growth. Stable, prosper-
ous, and friendly states enhance
American security and boost

U.S. economic opportunities.

We will continue to cham-
pion American values and
offer encouragement to those
struggling for human dig-
nity in their societies. There
can be no moral equivalency
between nations that uphold the
rule of law, empower women,
and respect individual rights
and those that brutalize and suppress their peo-
ple. Through our words and deeds, America
demonstrates a positive alternative to political

and religious despotism.

Encourage Aspiring Partners

Some of the greatest triumphs of American state-
craft resulted from helping fragile and develop-
ing countries become successful societies. These
successes, in turn, created profitable markets for
American businesses, allies to help achieve favor-
able regional balances of power, and coalition part-
ners to share burdens and address a variety of prob-
lems around the world. Over time, the United States
has helped create a network of states that advance

our common interests and values.

This historical record is unprecedented and excep-
tional. American support to aspiring partners
enabled the recovery of the countries of Western

Europe under the Marshall Plan, as well as the

ongoing integration of Central and Eastern Europe
into Western institutions after the Cold War.
In Asia, the United States worked with South Korea
and Japan, countries ravaged by war, to help them
become successful democracies and among the

most prosperous economies

in the world.

 

These achievements were prod-
ucts of patient partnerships
with those who aspired to build
prosperous societies and join
the community of democratic
states. They resulted in mutu-
ally beneficial relationships in
which the United States helped
states mobilize their own
resources to achieve transitions
to growth and stability. Working
with these countries made the
United States wealthier and
more competitive. This progress illustrates how
effective foreign assistance programs should reach

their natural endpoint.

Today, the United States must compete for positive
relationships around the world. China and Russia
target their investments in the developing world to
expand influence and gain competitive advantages
against the United States. China is investing bil-
lions of dollars in infrastructure across the globe.
Russia, too, projects its influence economically,
through the control of key energy and other infra-
structure throughout parts of Europe and Central
Asia. The United States provides an alternative to
state-directed investments, which often leave devel-
oping countries worse off. The United States pur-
sues economic ties not only for market access but
also to create enduring relationships to advance

common political and security interests.

The United States will promote a development
model that partners with countries that want prog-
ress, consistent with their culture, based on free

market principles, fair and reciprocal trade, private

 

PILLAR IV: ADVANCE AMERICAN INFLUENCE

 

sector activity, and rule of law. The United States
will shift away froma reliance on assistance based
on grants to approaches that attract private capital
and catalyze private sector activity. We will empha-
size reforms that unlock the economic potential of
citizens, such as the promotion of formal property
rights, entrepreneurial reforms, and infrastruc-
ture improvements—projects that help people earn
their livelihood and have the added benefit of help-
ing U.S. businesses. By mobilizing both public and
private resources, the United States can help maxi-
mize returns and outcomes and reduce the burden
on U.S. Government resources. Unlike the state-di-
rected mercantilism of some competitors that
can disadvantage recipient nations and promote
dependency, the purpose of U.S. foreign assistance
should be to end the need for it. The United States

seeks strong partners, not weak ones.

U.S. development assistance must support
America’s national interests. We will prioritize col-
laboration with aspiring partners that are aligned
with U.S. interests. We will focus on development
investments where we can have the most impact—
where local reformers are committed to tackling

their economic and political challenges.

Within this framework, the United States will
also assist fragile states to prevent threats to the
U.S. homeland. Transnational threat organiza-
tions, such as jihadist terrorists and organized
crime, often operate freely from fragile states
and undermine sovereign governments. Failing

states can destabilize entire regions.

Across Africa, Latin America, and Asia, states are
eager for investments and financing to develop
their infrastructure and propel growth. The
United States and its partners have opportuni-
ties to work with countries to help them real-
ize their potential as prosperous and sovereign
states that are accountable to their people. Such
states can become trading partners that buy more
American-made goods and create more predict-

able business environments that benefit American

companies. American-led investments represent
the most sustainable and responsible approach
to development and offer a stark contrast to
the corrupt, opaque, exploitive, and low-qual-

ity deals offered by authoritarian states.

Priority Actions:
Developing Countries

MOBILIZE RESOURCES: The United States will
modernize its development finance tools so that
U.S. companies have incentives to capitalize on
opportunities in developing countries. With
these changes, the United States will not be left
behind as other states use investment and proj-
ect finance to extend their influence. In addi-
tion, the U.S. Government must not be an obsta-
cle to U.S. companies that want to conduct

business in the developing world.

CAPITALIZE ON NEW TECHNOLOGIES: We will incor-
porate innovative technologies in our diplo-
matic and development programs. For exam-
ple, digital technologies enable millions to access
financial services through their cell phones and
can connect farmers to markets. Such technol-
ogies can reduce corruption, increase trans-
parency, and help ensure that money reaches

its intended destination.

INCENTIVIZE REFORMS: The United States will use
diplomacy and assistance to encourage states to
make choices that improve governance, rule of
law, and sustainable development. We already
do this through the Millennium Challenge
Corporation, which selects countries that are
committed to reform and then monitors and

evaluates their projects.

Priority Actions: Fragile States

COMMIT SELECTIVELY: We will give priority to
strengthening states where state weaknesses or

failure would magnify threats to the American

 

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

homeland. For instance, engagement in
Afghanistan seeks to prevent the reemergence of

terrorist safe havens.

WORK WITH REFORMERS: Political problems are at
the root of most state fragility. The United States
will prioritize programs that empower reform-
minded governments, people, and civil society. As
the United States designs its efforts, inputs from
local actors improve the likelihood of enduring
solutions, reduce costs, and increase accountabil-

ity to the American taxpayer.

SYNCHRONIZE ACTIONS: The United States must
use its diplomatic, economic, and military tools
simultaneously when assisting aspiring part-
ners. We will place a priority on economic
support that achieves local and macroeconomic
stability, helps build capable security forces, and

strengthens the rule of law.

Achieve Better Outcomes
in Multilateral Forums

The United States must lead and engage in the
multinational arrangements that shape many
of the rules that affect U.S. interests and values.
A competition for influence exists in these insti-
tutions. As we participate in them, we must pro-
tect American sovereignty and advance American

interests and values.

A range of international institutions establishes
the rules for how states, businesses, and individ-
uals interact with each other, across land and sea,
the Arctic, outer space, and the digital realm. It is
vital to U.S. prosperity and security that these insti-
tutions uphold the rules that help keep these com-
mon domains open and free. Free access to the seas
remains a central principle of national security
and economic prosperity, and exploration of sea
and space provides opportunities for commercial

gain and scientific breakthroughs. The flow of data

and an open, interoperable Internet are insepara-

ble from the success of the U.S. economy.

Authoritarian actors have long recognized the
power of multilateral bodies and have used them
to advance their interests and limit the freedom
of their own citizens. If the United States cedes
leadership of these bodies to adversaries, oppor-
tunities to shape developments that are posi-
tive for the United States will be lost. All institu-
tions are not equal, however. The United States
will prioritize its efforts in those organizations
that serve American interests, to ensure that
they are strengthened and supportive of the
United States, our allies, and our partners. Where
existing institutions and rules need moderniz-
ing, the United States will lead to update them.
At the same time, it should be clear that the United
States will not cede sovereignty to those that claim
authority over American citizens and are in con-

flict with our constitutional framework.

Priority Actions

EXERCISE LEADERSHIP IN POLITICAL AND SECURITY
Boples: The United States will strive for outcomes
in political and security forums that are consis-
tent with U.S. interests and values—values which
are shared by our allies and partners. The United
Nations can help contribute to solving many of
the complex problems in the world, but it must be
reformed and recommit to its founding princi-
ples. We will require accountability and empha-
size shared responsibility among members. If the
United States is asked to provide a disproportion-
ate level of support for an institution, we will expect
a commensurate degree of influence over the

direction and efforts of that institution.

SHAPE AND REFORM INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL AND
TRADE INSTITUTIONS: The United States will continue
to play a leading role in institutions such as the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank,
and World Trade Organization (WTO), but will

 

 

PILLAR IV: ADVANCE AMERICAN INFLUENCE

 

improve their performance through reforms. These
reforms include encouraging multilateral devel-
opment banks to invest in high-quality infrastruc-
ture projects that promote economic growth. We
will press to make the WTO a more effective forum

to adjudicate unfair trade practices.

ENSURE COMMON DOMAINS
REMAIN FREE: The United States

 

will provide leadership and
technology to shape and gov-
ern common domains—space,
cyberspace, air, and mari-
time—within the framework of
international law. The United
States supports the peace-
ful resolution of disputes
under international law but
will use all of its instruments
of power to defend U.S. inter-
ests and to ensure common

domains remain free.

 

PROTECT A FREE AND OPEN

INTERNET: The United States

will advocate for open, interoperable commu-
nications, with minimal barriers to the global
exchange of information and services. The United
States will promote the free flow of data and pro-
tect its interests through active engagement in key
organizations, such as the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the
Internet Governance Forum (IGF), the UN, and the

International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

Champion American Values

The extraordinary trajectory of the United States
from a group of colonies to a thriving, industrial-
ized, sovereign republic—the world's lone super-
power-is a testimony to the strength of the idea
on which our Nation is founded, namely that

each of our citizens is born free and equal under

For much of the world,
America’s liberties are
inspirational, and the United
States will always stand
with those who seek freedom.
We will remain a beacon
of liberty and opportunity

around the world.

the law. America’s core principles, enshrined in
the Declaration of Independence, are secured by
the Bill of Rights, which proclaims our respect
for fundamental individual liberties beginning
with the freedoms of religion, speech, the press,
and assembly. Liberty, free enterprise, equal
justice under the law, and the dignity of every

human life are central to who

we are as a people.

These principles form the foun-
dation of our most endur-
ing alliances, and the United
States will continue to cham-
pion them. Governments that
respect the rights of their cit-
izens remain the best vehi-
cle for prosperity, human hap-
piness, and peace. In contrast,
governments that routinely
abuse the rights of their citi-
zens do not play constructive
roles in the world. For example,
governments that fail to treat
women equally do not allow

their societies to reach their potential.

No nation can unilaterally alleviate all human
suffering, but just because we cannot help every-
one does not mean that we should stop trying
to help anyone. For much of the world, America’s
liberties are inspirational, and the United States
will always stand with those who seek free-
dom. We will remain a beacon of liberty and

opportunity around the world.

The United States also remains committed to
supporting and advancing religious freedom—
America’s first freedom. Our Founders under-
stood religious freedom not as the state’s creation,
but as the gift of God to every person and a funda-

mental right for our flourishing society.

And it is part of our culture, as well as in America’s

interest, to help those in need and those trying to

 

 

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

build a better future for their families. We aid oth-
ers judiciously, aligning our means to our objec-
tives, but with a firm belief that we can improve
the lives of others while establishing conditions

for a more secure and prosperous world.

Priority Actions

SUPPORT THE DIGNITY OF INDIVIDUALS: We support,
with our words and actions, those who live under
oppressive regimes and who seek freedom, indi-
vidual dignity, and the rule of law. We are under
no obligation to offer the benefits of our free and
prosperous community to repressive regimes and
human rights abusers. We may use diplomacy,
sanctions, and other tools to isolate states and lead-
ers who threaten our interests and whose actions
run contrary to our values. We will not remain
silent in the face of evil. We will hold perpetra-

tors of genocide and mass atrocities accountable.

DEFEAT TRANSNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS:
There can be no greater action to advance the
rights of individuals than to defeat jihadist terror-
ists and other groups that foment hatred and use
violence to advance their supremacist Islamist ide-
ologies. We will continue to join with other states to

defeat this scourge of all civilized peoples.

EMPOWER WOMEN AND YOUTH: Societies that
empower women to participate fully in civic and
economic life are more prosperous and peace-
ful. We will support efforts to advance wom-
en’s equality, protect the rights of women and
girls, and promote women and youth empower-

ment programs.

PROTECT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND RELIGIOUS
MINORITIES: We will advocate on behalf of religious
freedom and threatened minorities. Religious
minorities continue to be victims of violence. We
will place a priority on protecting these groups
and will continue working with regional partners
to protect minority communities from attacks

and to preserve their cultural heritage.

REDUCE HUMAN SUFFERING: The United States will
continue to lead the world in humanitarian assis-
tance. Even as we expect others to share respon-
sibility, the United States will continue to cata-
lyze international responses to man-made and
natural disasters and provide our expertise and
capabilities to those in need. We will support
food security and health programs that save lives
and address the root cause of hunger and dis-
ease. We will support displaced people close to
their homes to help meet their needs until they
can safely and voluntarily return home.

THE STRATEGY
IN A REGIONAL CONTEXT

The United States must tailor our approaches to different regions of the

world to protect U.S. national interests. We require integrated regional strat-

egies that appreciate the nature and magnitude of threats, the intensity of

competitions, and the promise of available opportunities, all in the context

of local political, economic, social, and historical realities.

hanges ina regional balance of power can

have global consequences and threaten

U.S. interests. Markets, raw materi-
als, lines of communication, and human capital
are located within, or move among, key regions
of the world. China and Russia aspire to proj-
ect power worldwide, but they interact most with
their neighbors. North Korea and Iran also pose
the greatest menace to those closest to them. But,
as destructive weapons proliferate and regions
become more interconnected, threats become
more difficult to contain. And regional balances
that shift against the United States could combine
to threaten our security.

The United States must marshal the will and
capabilities to compete and prevent unfavorable
shifts in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the Middle
East. Sustaining favorable balances of power will
require a strong commitment and close cooper-
ation with allies and partners because allies and
partners magnify U.S. power and extend U.S. influ-
ence. They share our interests and responsibility
for resisting authoritarian trends, contesting radi-

cal ideologies, and deterring aggression.

In other regions of the world, instability and weak
governance threaten U.S. interests. Some gov-
ernments are unable to maintain security and
meet the basic needs of their people, making

their country and citizens vulnerable to preda-

tors. Terrorists and criminals thrive where gov-
ernments are weak, corruption is rampant, and
faith in government institutions is low. Strategic
competitors often exploit rather than discour-
age corruption and state weakness to extract

resources and exploit their populations.

Regions afflicted by instability and weak govern-
ments also offer opportunities to improve secu-
rity, promote prosperity, and restore hope. Aspiring
partner states across the developing world want
to improve their societies, build transparent and
effective governments, confront non-state threats,
and strengthen their sovereignty. Many recog-
nize the opportunities offered by market econo-
mies and political liberties and are eager for part-
nership with the United States and our allies. The
United States will encourage aspiring partners as
they undertake reforms and pursue their aspira-
tions. States that prosper and nations that tran-
sition from recipients of development assistance
to trading partners offer economic opportunities
for American businesses. And stability reduces

threats that target Americans at home.

Indo-Pacific

A geopolitical competition between free and
repressive visions of world order is taking place in

the Indo-Pacific region. The region, which stretches

 

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

from the west coast of India to the western shores
of the United States, represents the most populous
and economically dynamic part of the world. The
US. interest ina free and open Indo-Pacific extends

back to the earliest days of our republic.

Although the United States seeks to continue to
cooperate with China, China
is using economic induce-
ments and penalties, influ-
ence operations, and implied
military threats to persuade
other states to heed its political
and security agenda. China’s
infrastructure investments
and trade strategies reinforce
its geopolitical aspirations.
Its efforts to build and mili-
tarize outposts in the South
China Sea endanger the free
flow of trade, threaten the sov-
ereignty of other nations, and
undermine regional stabil-
ity. China has mounted a rapid military modern-
ization campaign designed to limit U.S. access to
the region and provide China a freer hand there.
China presents its ambitions as mutually ben-
eficial, but Chinese dominance risks diminish-
ing the sovereignty of many states in the Indo-
Pacific. States throughout the region are calling
for sustained U.S. leadership in a collective
response that upholds a regional order respect-

ful of sovereignty and independence.

In Northeast Asia, the North Korean regime is
rapidly accelerating its cyber, nuclear, and bal-
listic missile programs. North Korea’s pur-
suit of these weapons poses a global threat that
requires a global response. Continued provo-
cations by North Korea will prompt neighbor-
ing countries and the United States to further
strengthen security bonds and take additional
measures to protect themselves. And a nucle-

ar-armed North Korea could lead to the prolif:

strong commitment and close
cooperation with allies and
partners because allies and
partners magnify U.S. power

and extend US. influence.

 

eration of the world’s most destructive weapons

across the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.

U.S. allies are critical to responding to mutual
threats, such as North Korea, and preserving our
mutual interests in the Indo-Pacific region. Our
alliance and friendship with South Korea, forged
by the trials of history, is stron-
ger than ever. We welcome
and support the strong lead-
ership role of our critical ally,
Japan. Australia has fought
alongside us in every signif:
icant conflict since World
War I, and continues to rein-
force economic and security
arrangements that support our
shared interests and safeguard
democratic values across
the region. New Zealand is
a key U.S. partner contrib-
uting to peace and security
across the region. We welcome
India’s emergence as a leading global power and
stronger strategic and defense partner. We will
seek to increase quadrilateral cooperation with

Japan, Australia, and India.

In Southeast Asia, the Philippines and Thailand
remain important allies and markets for
Americans. Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and
Singapore are growing security and economic
partners of the United States. The Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) remain centerpieces
of the Indo-Pacific’s regional architecture and plat-

forms for promoting an order based on freedom.

Priority Actions

POLITICAL: Our vision for the Indo-Pacific excludes
no nation. We will redouble our commitment to
established alliances and partnerships, while

expanding and deepening relationships with new

 

 

THE STRATEGY IN A REGIONAL CONTEXT

 

partners that share respect for sovereignty, fair and
reciprocal trade, and the rule of law. We will rein-
force our commitment to freedom of the seas and
the peaceful resolution of territorial and maritime
disputes in accordance with international law.
We will work with allies and partners to achieve
complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclear-
ization on the Korean Peninsula and preserve

the non-proliferation regime in Northeast Asia.

ECONOMIC: The United States will encourage
regional cooperation to maintain free and open
seaways, transparent infrastructure financing
practices, unimpeded commerce, and the peace-
ful resolution of disputes. We will pursue bilateral
trade agreements ona fair and reciprocal basis. We
will seek equal and reliable access for American
exports. We will work with partners to build a net-
work of states dedicated to free markets and pro-
tected from forces that would subvert their sover-
eignty. We will strengthen cooperation with allies
on high-quality infrastructure. Working with
Australia and New Zealand, we will shore up frag-
ile partner states in the Pacific Islands region to
reduce their vulnerability to economic fluctu-

ations and natural disasters.

MILITARY AND SECURITY: We will maintain a forward
military presence capable of deterring and, if nec-
essary, defeating any adversary. We will strengthen
our long-standing military relationships and
encourage the development of a strong defense net-
work with our allies and partners. For example,
we will cooperate on missile defense with Japan
and South Korea to move toward an area defense
capability. We remain ready to respond with over-
whelming force to North Korean aggression and
will improve options to compel denuclearization
of the peninsula. We will improve law enforce-
ment, defense, and intelligence cooperation with
Southeast Asian partners to address the growing
terrorist threat. We will maintain our strong ties
with Taiwan in accordance with our “One China”

policy, including our commitments under the

Taiwan Relations Act to provide for Taiwan’s legit-
imate defense needs and deter coercion. We will
expand our defense and security cooperation with
India, a Major Defense Partner of the United States,
and support India’s growing relationships through-
out the region. We will re-energize our alliances
with the Philippines and Thailand and strengthen
our partnerships with Singapore, Vietnam,
Indonesia, Malaysia, and others to help them

become cooperative maritime partners.

Europe

A strong and free Europe is of vital importance to
the United States. We are bound together by our
shared commitment to the principles of democracy,
individual liberty, and the rule of law. Together, we
rebuilt Western Europe after World War II and cre-
ated institutions that produced stability and wealth
on both sides of the Atlantic. Today, Europe is one
of the most prosperous regions in the world and

our most significant trading partner.

Although the menace of Soviet communism is
gone, new threats test our will. Russia is using
subversive measures to weaken the credibil-
ity of America’s commitment to Europe, under-
mine transatlantic unity, and weaken European
institutions and governments. With its inva-
sions of Georgia and Ukraine, Russia demon-
strated its willingness to violate the sovereignty
of states in the region. Russia continues to intim-
idate its neighbors with threatening behavior,
such as nuclear posturing and the forward deploy-

ment of offensive capabilities.

China is gaining a strategic foothold in Europe by
expanding its unfair trade practices and invest-
ing in key industries, sensitive technologies, and
infrastructure. Europe also faces immediate
threats from violent Islamist extremists. Attacks
by ISIS and other jihadist groups in Spain, France,
Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and

 

 

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

other countries show that our European partners
continue to face serious threats. Instability in the
Middle East and Africa has triggered the movement
of millions of migrants and refugees into Europe,

exacerbating instability and tensions in the region.

The United States is safer when Europe is prosper-
ous and stable, and can help defend our shared
interests and ideals. The United States remains
firmly committed to our European allies and part-
ners. The NATO alliance of free and sovereign
states is one of our great advantages over our com-
petitors, and the United States remains commit-
ted to Article V of the Washington Treaty.

European allies and partners increase our strate-
gic reach and provide access to forward basing and
overflight rights for global operations. Together
we confront shared threats. European nations
are contributing thousands of troops to help fight
jihadist terrorists in Afghanistan, stabilize Iraq,
and fight terrorist organizations across Africa
and the greater Middle East.

The NATO alliance will become stronger when all
members assume greater responsibility for and
pay their fair share to protect our mutual interests,

sovereignty, and values.

Priority Actions

POLITICAL: The United States will deepen collabora-
tion with our European allies and partners to con-
front forces threatening to undermine our com-
mon values, security interests, and shared vision.
The United States and Europe will work together
to counter Russian subversion and aggression,
and the threats posed by North Korea and Iran.
We will continue to advance our shared princi-

ples and interests in international forums.

ECONOMIC: The United States will work with the
European Union, and bilaterally with the United
Kingdom and other states, to ensure fair and recip-

rocal trade practices and eliminate barriers to

growth. We will encourage European foreign direct
investment in the United States to create jobs. We
will work with our allies and partners to diver-
sify European energy sources to ensure the energy
security of European countries. We will work
with our partners to contest China’s unfair trade
and economic practices and restrict its acquisi-

tion of sensitive technologies.

MILITARY AND SECURITY: The United States ful-
fills our defense responsibilities and expects oth-
ers to do the same. We expect our European allies
to increase defense spending to 2 percent of gross
domestic product by 2024, with 20 percent of this
spending devoted to increasing military capa-
bilities. On NATO’s eastern flank we will con-
tinue to strengthen deterrence and defense, and
catalyze frontline allies and partners’ efforts
to better defend themselves. We will work with
NATO to improve its integrated air and mis-
sile defense capabilities to counter existing and
projected ballistic and cruise missile threats,
particularly from Iran. We will increase counter-

terrorism and cybersecurity cooperation.

Middle East

The United States seeks a Middle East that is
not a safe haven or breeding ground for jihadist
terrorists, not dominated by any power hostile to
the United States, and that contributes to a stable
global energy market.

For years, the interconnected problems of Iranian
expansion, state collapse, jihadist ideology,
socio-economic stagnation, and regional rival-
ries have convulsed the Middle East. The United
States has learned that neither aspirations for dem-
ocratic transformation nor disengagement can
insulate us from the region’s problems. We must
be realistic about our expectations for the region
without allowing pessimism to obscure our inter-

ests or vision for a modern Middle East.

 

 

THE STRATEGY IN A REGIONAL CONTEXT

 

The region remains home to the world’s most dan-
gerous terrorist organizations. ISIS and al-Qa'ida
thrive on instability and export violent jihad. Iran,
the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, has
taken advantage of instability to expand its influ-
ence through partners and proxies, weapon prolif:
eration, and funding. It continues to develop more
capable ballistic missiles and intelligence capa-
bilities, and it undertakes malicious cyber activ-
ities. These activities have continued unabated
since the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran continues to per-
petuate the cycle of violence in the region, caus-
ing grievous harm to civilian populations. Rival
states are filling vacuums created by state col-

lapse and prolonged regional conflict.

Despite these challenges, there are emerging
opportunities to advance American interests in
the Middle East. Some of our partners are working
together to reject radical ideologies, and key lead-
ers are calling for a rejection of Islamist extrem-

ism and violence. Encouraging

 

political stability and sustain-
able prosperity would contrib-
ute to dampening the conditions

that fuel sectarian grievances.

For generations the con-
flict between Israel and the
Palestinians has been under-
stood as the prime irritant
preventing peace and pros-
perity in the region. Today,
the threats from jihadist ter-
rorist organizations and the
threat from Iran are creating the realization that
Israel is not the cause of the region’s problems.
States have increasingly found common inter-

ests with Israel in confronting common threats.

Today, the United States has the opportunity to
catalyze greater economic and political cooper-
ation that will expand prosperity for those who
want to partner with us. By revitalizing partner-

ships with reform-minded nations and encour-

Terrorists and criminals

governments are weak,

and faith in government

aging cooperation among partners in the region,
the United States can promote stability and a bal-

ance of power that favors U.S. interests.

Priority Actions

POLITICAL: We will strengthen partnerships, and
form new ones, to help advance security through
stability. Whenever possible, we will encourage
gradual reforms. We will support efforts to counter
violent ideologies and increase respect for the dig-
nity of individuals. We remain committed to help-
ing our partners achieve a stable and prosperous
region, including through a strong and integrated
Gulf Cooperation Council. We will strengthen our
long-term strategic partnership with Iraq as an
independent state. We will seek a settlement to the
Syrian civil war that sets the conditions for refu-
gees to return home and rebuild their lives in safety.
We will work with partners to deny the Iranian
regime all paths to a nuclear
weapon and neutralize Iranian
malign influence. We remain
committed to helping facilitate
a comprehensive peace agree-
ment that is acceptable to both
Israelis and Palestinians.

corruption is rampant,

ECONOMIC: The United States
will support the reforms under-
way that begin to address core
inequities that jihadist terror-
ists exploit. We will encourage
states in the region, including
Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to continue moderniz-
ing their economies. We will play a role in catalyz-
ing positive developments by engaging economi-
cally, supporting reformers, and championing the

benefits of open markets and societies.

MILITARY AND SECURITY: We will retain the neces-
sary American military presence in the region to
protect the United States and our allies from ter-

rorist attacks and preserve a favorable regional

 

 

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

balance of power. We will assist regional part-
ners in strengthening their institutions and
capabilities, including in law enforcement, to
conduct counterterrorism and counterinsur-
gency efforts. We will help partners procure
interoperable missile defense and other capa-
bilities to better defend against active missile
threats. We will work with partners to neutral-

ize Iran’s malign activities in the region.

South and Central Asia

With over a quarter of the world’s population, a
fifth of all U.S.-designated terrorist groups, several
fast-growing economies, and two nuclear-armed
states, South and Central Asia present some of the
most complicated national security challenges
and opportunities. The region spans the terrorist
threats emanating from the Middle East and the
competition for power unfolding in Europe and
the Indo-Pacific. The United States continues to
face threats from transnational terrorists and mili-
tants operating from within Pakistan. The prospect
for an Indo-Pakistani military conflict that could
lead to a nuclear exchange remains a key concern
requiring consistent diplomatic attention.

US. interests in the region include countering ter-
rorist threats that impact the security of the U.S.
homeland and our allies, preventing cross-border
terrorism that raises the prospect of military and
nuclear tensions, and preventing nuclear weap-
ons, technology, and materials from falling into
the hands of terrorists. We seek an American pres-
ence in the region proportionate to threats to the
homeland and our allies. We seek a Pakistan that is
not engaged in destabilizing behavior and a stable
and self-reliant Afghanistan. And we seek Central
Asian states that are resilient against domination
by rival powers, are resistant to becoming jihad-
ist safe havens, and prioritize reforms.

Priority Actions

POLITICAL: We will deepen our strategic partner-
ship with India and support its leadership role
in Indian Ocean security and throughout the
broader region. We will press Pakistan to inten-
sify its counterterrorism efforts, since no part-
nership can survive a country’s support for mil-
itants and terrorists who target a partner’s own
service members and officials. The United States
will also encourage Pakistan to continue demon-
strating that it is a responsible steward of its
nuclear assets. We will continue to partner with
Afghanistan to promote peace and security in the
region. We will continue to promote anti-corrup-
tion reform in Afghanistan to increase the legit-
imacy of its government and reduce the appeal of
violent extremist organizations. We will help South
Asian nations maintain their sovereignty as China

increases its influence in the region.

Economic: We will encourage the economic inte-
gration of Central and South Asia to promote
prosperity and economic linkages that will bol-
ster connectivity and trade. And we will encour-
age India to increase its economic assistance
in the region. In Pakistan, we will build trade
and investment ties as security improves and as
Pakistan demonstrates that it will assist the United

States in our counterterrorism goals.

MILITARY AND SECURITY: We are committed to
supporting the Afghan government and security
forces in their fight against the Taliban, al-Qaida,
ISIS, and other terrorists. We will bolster the
fighting strength of the Afghan security forces
to convince the Taliban that they cannot win on
the battlefield and to set the conditions for diplo-
matic efforts to achieve enduring peace. We will
insist that Pakistan take decisive action against
militant and terrorist groups operating from its
soil. We will work with the Central Asian states
to guarantee access to the region to support our

counterterrorism efforts.

 

THE STRATEGY IN A REGIONAL CONTEXT

 

Western Hemisphere

Stable, friendly, and prosperous states in the
Western Hemisphere enhance our security and
benefit our economy. Democratic states con-
nected by shared values and economic interests
will reduce the violence, drug trafficking, and ille-
gal immigration that threaten our common secu-
rity, and will limit opportunities for adversar-

ies to operate from areas of close proximity to us.

In the last half century, parts of this hemisphere
were marred by dictatorships and insurgencies
that killed tens of thousands of people. Today,
this region stands on the cusp of prosperity and
peace, built upon democracy and the rule of law.
U.S. trade in the region is thriving and market
opportunities for American goods and services,
energy and infrastructure projects, and foreign

direct investment continue to expand.

Challenges remain, however. Transnational crim-
inal organizations—including gangs and cartels—
perpetuate violence and corruption, and threaten
the stability of Central American states includ-
ing Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. In
Venezuela and Cuba, governments cling to anach-
ronistic leftist authoritarian models that con-
tinue to fail their people. Competitors have found

operating space in the hemisphere.

China seeks to pull the region into its orbit through
state-led investments and loans. Russia contin-
ues its failed politics of the Cold War by bolster-
ing its radical Cuban allies as Cuba continues to
repress its citizens. Both China and Russia sup-
port the dictatorship in Venezuela and are seek-
ing to expand military linkages and arms sales
across the region. The hemisphere’s democratic
states have a shared interest in confronting threats

to their sovereignty.

Canada and the United States share a unique
strategic and defense partnership. The United

States also has important and deepening rela-

tions with key countries in the region. Together,
we will build a stable and peaceful hemisphere
that increases economic opportunities for all,
improves governance, reduces the power of crim-
inal organizations, and limits the malign influ-

ence of non-hemispheric forces.

Priority Actions

POLITICAL: We will catalyze regional efforts to build
security and prosperity through strong diplomatic
engagement. We will isolate governments that
refuse to act as responsible partners in advancing
hemispheric peace and prosperity. We look forward
to the day when the people of Cuba and Venezuela
can enjoy freedom and the benefits of shared pros-
perity, and we encourage other free states in the

hemisphere to support this shared endeavor.

ECONOMIC: We will modernize our trade agree-
ments and deepen our economic ties with the
region and ensure that trade is fair and reciprocal.
We will encourage further market-based economic
reforms and encourage transparency to create con-
ditions for sustained prosperity. We will ensure
the U.S. financial system does not serve as a haven

or transit point for criminal proceeds.

MILITARY AND SECURITY: We will build upon local
efforts and encourage cultures of lawfulness to
reduce crime and corruption, including by sup-
porting local efforts to professionalize police and
other security forces; strengthen the rule of law
and undertake judicial reform; and improve infor-
mation sharing to target criminals and corrupt

leaders and disrupt illicit trafficking.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

 

Africa

Africa remains a continent of promise and endur-
ing challenges. Africa contains many of the world’s
fastest growing economies, which represent poten-
tial new markets for U.S. goods and services.
Aspiring partners across the continent are eager
to build market-based economies and enhance sta-
bility. The demand for quality American exports is
high and will likely grow as Africa’s population and
prosperity increase. People across the continent are
demanding government accountability and less
corruption, and are opposing autocratic trends. The
number of stable African nations has grown since
the independence era as numerous countries have
emerged from devastating conflicts and undergone

democratic transitions.

Despite this progress, many states face political
turbulence and instability that spills into other
regions. Corruption and weak governance threaten
to undermine the political
benefits that should emerge
from new economic opportu-
nities. Many African states
are battlegrounds for vio-
lent extremism and jihad-
ist terrorists. ISIS, al-Qa’ida,
and their affiliates oper-
ate on the continent and
have increased the lethal-
ity of their attacks, expanded
into new areas, and targeted
U.S. citizens and interests.
African nations and regional
organizations have demon-
strated a commitment to confront the threat
from jihadist terrorist organizations, but their

security capabilities remain weak.

China is expanding its economic and military
presence in Africa, growing from a small inves-
tor in the continent two decades ago into Africa’s

largest trading partner today. Some Chinese prac-

tices undermine Africa’s long-term development
by corrupting elites, dominating extractive indus-
tries, and locking countries into unsustainable

and opaque debts and commitments.

The United States seeks sovereign African states
that are integrated into the world economy, able
to provide for their citizens’ needs, and capable of
managing threats to peace and security. Improved
governance in these states supports economic
development and opportunities, diminishes the
attraction of illegal migration, and reduces vulner-

ability to extremists, thereby reducing instability.

Priority Actions

POLITICAL: The United States will partner with
governments, civil society, and regional organi-
zations to end long-running, violent conflicts.
We will encourage reform, working with prom-
ising nations to promote effective governance,
improve the rule of law, and
develop institutions account-
able and responsive to cit-
izens. We will continue to
respond to humanitarian
needs while also working
with committed governments
and regional organizations
to address the root causes of
human suffering. If neces-
sary, we are prepared to sanc-
tion government officials
and institutions that prey
on their citizens and com-
mit atrocities. When there is
no alternative, we will suspend aid rather than

see it exploited by corrupt elites.

ECONOMIC: We will expand trade and commercial
ties to create jobs and build wealth for Americans
and Africans. We will work with reform-oriented
governments to help establish conditions that can

transform them into trading partners and improve

THE STRATEGY IN A REGIONAL CONTEXT

 

their business environment. We will support eco-
nomic integration among African states. We will
work with nations that seek to move beyond assis-
tance to partnerships that promote prosperity.
We will offer American goods and services, both
because it is profitable for us and because it serves
as an alternative to China’s often extractive eco-

nomic footprint on the continent.

MILITARY AND SECURITY: We will continue to work
with partners to improve the ability of their secu-
rity services to counter terrorism, human traf:
ficking, and the illegal trade in arms and natural
resources. We will work with partners to defeat
terrorist organizations and others who threaten

U.S. citizens and the homeland.

 

 

 

CONCLUSION

This National Security Strategy sets a positive strategic direction for the United

States that is meant to reassert America’s advantages on the world stage and to

build upon our country’s great strengths. During the Trump Administration,

the American people can be confident that their security and prosperity will

always come first. A secure, prosperous, and free America will be strong and

ready to lead abroad to protect our interests and our way of life.

merica’s renewed strategic confidence
is anchored in our recommitment to
the principles inscribed in our found-
ing documents. The National Security Strategy
celebrates and protects what we hold dear—
individual liberty, the rule of law, a democratic
system of government, tolerance, and opportunity
for all. By knowing ourselves and what we stand
for, we clarify what we must defend and we estab-

lish guiding principles for our actions.

This strategy is guided by principled real-
ism. It is realist because it acknowledges the
central role of power in international poli-
tics, affirms that sovereign states are the best
hope for a peaceful world, and clearly defines
our national interests. It is principled because

it is grounded in the knowledge that advanc-

ing American principles spreads peace and
prosperity around the globe. We are guided

by our values and disciplined by our interests.

This Administration has a bright vision of America’s
future. America’s values and influence, under-
written by American power, make the world more

free, secure, and prosperous.

Our Nation derives its strength from the American
people. Every American has a role to play in this
grand, national effort to implement this America
First National Security Strategy. Together, our task
is to strengthen our families, to build up our com-
munities, to serve our citizens, and to celebrate
American greatness as a shining example to the
world. We will leave our children and grandchil-
dren a Nation that is stronger, better, freer, prouder,

and greater than ever before.

1. An American Perspective

In the early days of this Administration we laid the
foundation for a more constructive and positive
American role in world affairs by clarifying the
essential elements of U.S. foreign and defense policy.

Over the intervening years, we have looked objectively
at our policies and performance on the world scene to
ensure they reflect the dynamics of a complex and
ever-changing world. Where course adjustments have
been required, | have directed changes. But we have
not veered and will not veer from the broad aims that
guide America’s leadership role in today’s world: -

and prosperity;

© Strong and close relationships with our Alliance
partners around the world;

© Active assistance to those who are struggling for
their own self-determination, freedom, and a
reasonable standard of living and development;

© Willingness to be realistic about the Soviet Union,
to define publicly the crucial moral: distinctions
between totalitarianism and democracy; and

© Seeking meaningful ways of working with the
Soviet leaders to prevent war and make the world a
more peaceful place.

The foundation of a sound National Security Strategy,
laid in the early days of this Administration, has held
firm and served us well. Our economic, political and
military power is resurgent. The Western democracies
are revitalized, and across the world nations are turning
to democratic ideas and the principles of the free
market. In all of this, the United States continues to
encourage those who seek the benefits of our
democratic way of life.

While the United States has been the leader of the free
world since the end of the Second World War, we have

not acted alone. During that war and in the succeeding
four decades, our strategy has been based on
partnership with those nations that share our common
goals.

As the world has changed over the years, the
differences between nations striving to develop
democratic institutions and those following the
totalitarian banner have come into sharp focus. As
future changes take place in human rights, advanced
technology, quality of life, and the global economy, our
example will continue to exert tremendous influence
on mankind. The United States is on the right side of
this historic struggle and we have tried to build a
lasting framework for promoting this positive change.

This National Security Strategy Report builds on the
efforts of the Administration, Congress, and the
American people over the past six years. But any
strategy document is only a guide, To be effective, it
must be firmly rooted in broad national interests and
objectives, supported by an adequate commitment of
resources, and integrate all relevant facets of national
power to achieve our national objectives. It must
provide a framework within which more specific and
detailed objectives can be identified by those executive
branch agencies charged with stewardship over various
elements of the nation’s power. And it must guide the
creation of specific plans for attainment of those more
detailed objectives.

For this reason, the annual presentations to the
Congress by the Secretary of State and Secretary of
Defense play a key role in supporting the objectives
outlined in this report. in their respective areas of
Foreign and Defense Policy, they develop detailed
plans of action to sustain our National Strategy,
advance U.S. interests and most importantly, reduce the
risk to our nation and our allies.

What follows is this Administration's effort to articulate
the National Security Strategy of the United States—a
blueprint for future freedom, peace, and prosperity.

 

 

 

 

Il. Fundamentals of U.S. National

Security Strategy

U.S. SECURITY IN A
COMPLEX AND
CHANGING WORLD

In the years following World War ll, the United States
faced, for the first time, an inescapable responsibility
for world affairs. No longer protected by nearly perfect
fortresses ‘of oceans, allied with countries devastated by
war, and presented with irrefutable evidence of Soviet
expansionist aspirations, the United States shouldered
the dual burden of facilitating the restoration of a world
economic order and arresting the spread of the Soviet
Union's peculiar brand of totalitarianism and
communism.

The United States responded to the threats posed by
Moscow with a policy of containment. Containment, as
a strategy for world peace, entailed three distinct
elements.

The first element, U.S. defense policy, involved forward
deployment of military forces as necessary to deter and
contain Soviet military expansion. In practice, this
meant keeping, for the first time in our history, large
military formations on the soil of allies in Western
Europe and East Asia. As Soviet nuclear weapons
delivery systems grew, it also required a large strategic
force, to augment the deterrence provided by the .
conventional forces of the United States and its allies.
Thus our military security system rested primarily on
two strategic zones, Europe and East Asia, backed by
our nuclear deterrent forces.

The second element, U.S. international economic
policy, involved economic recovery programs for

Western Europe-and Japan. It also required U.S.
leadership in establishing and managing the
international monetary system, and encouraging
regional and global free-trade agreements.

The third element, U.S. policy toward the Third World,
included both economic and security assistance. It also
had a profound political component: decolonization,
self-determination, and support for the evolution toward
democracy. The Soviet Union opposed us in the Third
World with a policy of “wars of national liberation,’
through which they sought to exploit the instability of
emerging nations to establish Marxist-Leninist regimes
based on the Soviet model.

The three postwar decades witnessed important
successes for our National Strategy. World war was
avoided. Europe and Japan regained their prosperity,
with the help of massive U.S. assistance, and most of
the Third World was decolonized. Containment,
however, was an expensive policy. But because the
United States had the lion’s share of the developed
world’s economic power, we could carry the burden.

The postwar era came to an end during the 1970s. The

- causes of its demise were threefold. First, the success of

U.S. economic: policies in Europe and East Asia
dramatically changed the distribution of wealth and
power within our alliance systems. The United States
no longer had an overwhelming economic position vis-
avis Western Europe and the East Asia rimland. And
our success in deterring Soviet military aggression in
these two strategic zones created growing public belief
that direct Soviet aggression in these two regions had
become less likely.

Second, the Soviet military buildup and the projection
of Soviet power into Cuba, Nicaragua, the Middle East,

3

 

 

Southeast and Southwest Asia, and Africa required
changes in strategy for implementing our containment
policy. Particularly significant was the Soviet Union's
attainment of strategic nuclear parity with the United
States.

Third, the political awakening in the Third World
created civil wars and regional conflicts that threatened
to draw the United States and the Soviet Union into
direct military confrontations. And economic
developments, particularly in the energy area,
contributed to political instability and caused
destabilizing effects in the international monetary
system.

In such a significantly different world, the foundations
of strategic planning had to be reconsidered. U.S.
military superiority in strategic forces no longer exists
and the continued growth of Soviet military capabilities
applicable to Europe, the Persian Gulf, and other
important areas, pose a continuing threat to regional
security.

Today it is more important than ever before that our
National Security Strategy be based on a solid
understanding of U.S, interests and objectives and a
realistic approach to dealing with the Soviet Union and
other threats to U.S. security.

U.S. INTERESTS

U.S. National Security Strategy reflects our national
interests and presents a broad plan for achieving the
national objectives that support those interests. The key
national interests which our strategy seeks to assure
and protect include:

1. The survival of the United States as a free and
independent nation, with its fundamental values and
institutions intact.

2. A healthy and growing U.S. economy.

3. The growth of freedom, democratic institutions, and
free market economies throughout the world, linked
by a fair and open international trading system.

4. A stable and secure world, free of major threats to
US. interests. .

5. The health and vigor of U.S. alliance relationships.

‘MAJOR OBJECTIVES

IN SUPPORT OF
U.S. INTERESTS

US. national security objectives are statements of
broad goals which support and advance national
interests. As such, they are not intended to be applied
mechanically or automatically, but constitute a general
guide for policy development in specific situations
which call for the coordinated use of national power.
The principal objectives which support our national
interests are:

1. To maintain the security of our nation and our allies.
The United States, in cooperation with its allies, must
seek to deter any aggression that could threaten that
security, and, should deterrence fail, must be prepared
to repel or defeat any military attack and end the
conflict on terms favorable to the United States, its
interests, and its allies.

Specifically:

© To deter hostile attack of the United States, its
citizens, military forces, or allies and to defeat attack
if deterrence fails.

© To maintain the strength and vitality of U.S. alliance
relationships.

© To deal effectively with threats to the security of the
United States and its citizens short of armed conflict,
including the threat of international terrorism.

© To prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.

© To reduce over the long term our reliance on nuclear
weapons by strengthening our conventional forces,
pursuing equitable and verifiable arms control
agreements, and developing technologies for
strategic defense.

© To assure unimpeded U.S. access to the oceans and
space,

© To prevent the domination of the Eurasian landmass
by the USSR (or any other hostile power, or
coalition of powers).

© To force the Soviet Union to bear the brunt of its
domestic economic shortcomings in order to
discourage excessive Soviet military expenditures
and global adventurism. ~

© To foster closer relations with the People’s Republic
of China.

 

2. To respond to the challenges of the global economy.
Economic interdependence has brought tremendous
benefits to the United States, but also presents new
policy problems which must be resolved. Since our
resource dependence has grown, the potential
vulnerability of our supply lines is an issue of concern.
Although continuing U.S, economic growth is helping
lift the world out of recéssion, economic slowdown
continues in many countries. We must devote
attention to critical global problems, which if
unresolved or unattended, may affect U.S. interests in
the future. Many of these problems such as Third
World debt, the international narcotics trade, and
growing protectionism are currently having an impact
on U.S, interests.

Specifically:

© To promote a strong, prosperous and competitive
U.S. economy, in the context of a stable and growing
world economy.

* To ensure U.S. access to foreign markets, and to
ensure the United States and its allies and friends
access to foreign energy and mineral resources.

© To promote a well-functioning international
economic system with minimal distortions to trade
and investment, stable currencies, and broadly
agreed and respected rules for managing and
resolving differences.

3. To defend and advance the cause of democracy,
freedom, and human rights throughout the world. A
foreign policy that ignored the fate of millions around
the world who seek freedom would be a betrayal of
our national heritage. Our own freedom, and that of
our allies, could never be secure in a world where
freedom was threatened everywhere else.

Specifically:
© To promote the growth of national independence
and free institutions throughout the world.

© To encourage and support aid, trade, and
investment programs that promote economic
development and the growth of free and humane
social and political orders in the Third World.

© To encourage liberalizing tendencies within the
Soviet Union and its client states.

4. To resolve peacefully disputes which affect U.S.
interests in troubled regions of the world. Regional
conflicts which involve allies or friends of the United
States may threaten USS. interests, and frequently carry
the risk of escalation to a wider conflict. Conflicts, or
attempts to subvert friendly governments, which are
instigated or supported by the Soviets and their client
states, represent a particularly serious threat to U.S.
interests.

Specifically:

© To maintain stable global and regional military.
balances vis-a-vis the USSR and states aligned with it.

© To aid threatened states in resisting Soviet or Soviet-
sponsored subversion or aggression.

© To eliminate, where possible, the root causes of
regional instabilities which create the risk of
major war.

© To neutralize the efforts of the Soviet Union to
increase its influence in the world and weaken the
links between the USSR and its client states in the
Third World.

© To aid in combatting threats to the stability of
‘friendly governments and institutions from
insurgencies, state-sponsored terrorism and the
international trafficking of illicit drugs.

5. To build effective and favorable relationships with all
nations with whom there is a basis of shared concern.
in the world today, there are over 150 nations. Not one
of them is the equal of the United States in total power
or wealth, but each is sovereign, and most, if not all,
touch U.S. interests directly or indirectly.

Specifically:

© To support the formation of associations of states
friendly to U.S. interests using the full range of
diplomatic, political, economic, and informational
efforts.

© To make major international institutions more
effective in promoting peace, world order and
political, economic and social progress.

© To explore the possibility of improved relations with
those nations hostile to us in order to reduce the
chance of future conflict.

© To strengthen U.S. influence throughout the world.

5

 

Our National Security Strategy must be resolute in
supporting U.S. interests and objectives. It must also
take into account the many threats and instabilities of
today’s complex and changing world.

PRINCIPAL THREATS TO
U.S. INTERESTS

The most significant threat to U.S. security and national
interests is the global challenge posed by the Soviet
Union. While only a handful of people in the Politburo
can claim with any confidence to know the Kremlin's
precise near-term, tactical plans, the long-term strategic
direction of Soviet foreign policy is clearer. Motivated
by the demands of a political system held together and
dominated by Marxist-Leninist ideology and the
political party which represents it, Moscow seeks to
alter the existing international system and establish
Soviet global hegemony. These long-range Soviet
objectives constitute the overall conceptual framework
of Soviet foreign and defense policy.

Fundamental differences in economic, social, and
political beliefs and objectives lead to an essentially
adversarial relationship between the United States and
the Soviet Union. The two sides nevertheless share the
common goal of avoiding direct confrontation and
reducing the threat of nuclear war. The real challenge
for American statecraft is how best to realize this
commonality of interests, so as to preserve peace,
without jeopardizing our national security or
abandoning our commitment to the cause of freedom
and justice.

To execute its-expansionist policies, the USSR has
perpetuated a domestic political system of centralized
totalitarian control and mobilized and organized this
system to support its international objectives.
Internationally, the Soviets have continued to assist
groups waging so-called wars of “national liberation’
sponsor with arms and military training international
terrorist groups, promote and exploit regional
instabilities and conduct an aggressive and illegal war
in Afghanistan. In numerous other places around the
globe, Soviet advisors and combat troops have also

6

engaged in conduct in violation of international
agreements.

The Soviets have undertaken an unprecedented military

buildup that poses a continuing threat to the United

States and our allies. The Soviet leadership clearly

attaches the greatest importance to its military strength,

which has been the most significant source of the

USSR’s influence on the international scene. For

decades the Soviet Union has allocated a |
disproportionate percentage of national income to the :
buildup of its military forces. It now has a uniformed

military of more than five million (excluding more than

one million border guards and other security forces). It

is estimated that military expenditures currently absorb

15-17 percent of the total Soviet GNP.

 

Soviet military power permits Moscow to provide a
strong defense of the homeland while facilitating direct
and indirect participation in regional conflicts beyond
Soviet borders, Furthermore, Soviet military resources
increasingly are used to influence and broker the
policies of other countries and to promote instability.

The evidence of the relationship between the Soviet
Union and the growth of worldwide terrorism is now
conclusive. Even though the Soviet Union does not
have direct control over most of the terrorist groups, it
supplies massive amounts of arms, money, and
advisory assistance to revolutionary forces engaged in
terrorist activities. The Soviets attempt to disguise such
support by using middle men—radical governments
such as Cuba, North Korea, Nicaragua, Syria, and
Libya, which deal directly with radical terrorists and
insurgents, Whether Moscow is providing support
directly or indirectly, the ultimate targets of radical
terrorism are the United States, Western Europe, Japan,
and other moderate, pro-Western governments.

The Soviet Union in recent years has become much
more sophisticated in wielding the instruments of
national power. Despite significant weaknesses in the
Soviet economy, the Politburo actively employs
economic instruments in its global strategy. It uses
trade with the West to obtain economic leverage,
technology, and foreign exchange. The acquisition of
military-related advanced technology through legal and

 

illegal means, is especially important to the Soviets, to
shorten weapon development times, reduce costs, and
to compensate for the weakness of the Soviet economy.
Acquisition of production technology is equally
important to the Soviets, to improve the efficiency of
their defense industry. Access to Western manufacturing
equipment, processes, and know-how has enabled
Soviet defense plants to introduce some advanced
weapons into production up to five years earlier than
would have been otherwise possible. The Soviets also
attempt to obtain long-term economic agreements
which build relationships of dependency on the USSR
(e.g., those relating to the supply of energy resources to
Western Europe).

In addition, the Soviets have established a massive
political influence apparatus. This apparatus includes
the world’s largest propaganda machine, incorporating
overt and clandestine activities in all types of media;
funding and ‘support of foreign communist parties and
front organizations; political and ideological
indoctrination of foreign students, government officials,
terrorists, and military personnel; and perceptions
management of foreign visitors to the USSR. It includes
separate efforts to conduct “active measures,’ including
disinformation, forgeries, the use of political agents of
influence, and other deceptive operations.

While the Soviets cannot be branded as instigators of
all revolutionary movements, their strategy clearly is to
exploit domestic vulnerabilities in foreign countries to
promote the emergence of regimes under Soviet
influence or control. All this is accomplished under the
rubric of “peaceful coexistence” with the United States
and the West, defined as a continuing contest in which
all forms of struggle are permissible short of all-out war.

While we remain properly concerned with the Soviet
threat, we must not neglect other destabilizing
international threats and problems which can seriously
damage U.S. interests if not properly addressed. These
include non-communist nations with oppressive
governments and ideologies opposed to ours;
international economic concerns of massive world
debt, trade imbalances, and shifts in comparative
advantage in our interdependent global economic
system; the global population explosion and related
food, water, and poverty problems; the proliferation of
nuclear weapons; drug trafficking; and human rights
violations, to name only a few.

An additional threat, which is particularly insidious in
nature and growing in scope, is international
terrorism—a worldwide phenomenon that is becoming
increasingly frequent, indiscriminate, and state-
supported. Terrorism is likely to be a prominent feature
of the international landscape for the remainder of this
century. It directly attacks our democratic values,
undermines our diplomatic efforts for peaceful
solutions to conflicts, and erodes the foundations of
civilized societies. Effectively countering terrorism is a
major national security objective of the United States.

A solid understanding of our national interests and
objectives, against the backdrop of major threats to
those interests, is essential to devising sound strategies.
The next two chapters will discuss the principal
elements of our foreign and defense policies, and the
ways in which they contribute to the achievement of
national security objectives. The effective integration of
our foreign and defense policies provides the .
foundation for our National Security Strategy.

 

 

Ill. U.S. Foreign Policy

CONTINUITY OF
BASIC GOALS

Our foreign policy reflects the basic thrust of our
National Security Strategy—the promotion of our
democratic way of life. History has shown us
repeatedly that only in democracies is there inherent
respect for individual liberties and rights. In the
postwar world, democracies have also exhibited
extraordinary economic vitality. With their more
flexible economies, democracies have continued to
demonstrate the efficiency and dynamism necessary to
maintain strength in a complex and difficult
international economic environment.

If we are to achieve the kind of world we all hope to
see, democracy must continue to prosper and expand.
Today, in a number of countries in varying stages of
economic development, democracy is growing
stronger. The United States must be.a beacon for
democracy. Unfortunately, many in the world are
prevented from seeing our beacon. For many more, it
has been distorted; and still others, who are able to see
it and are inspired by it, need help in the form of
practical assistance.

We have provided assistance before—in postwar
Western Europe and Asia—and we must again. What
we helped achieve in those areas constitutes one of the
most remarkable, positive chapters of recent history.
Our support for democracy should not be hidden; it
must be active and visible. Active support of
democratic forces in the past two decades has
demonstrated the value of this legitimate and important
activity. The substantial support provided by West

 

European democratic parties significantly aided
the successful drives of democratic movements in
Spain and Portugal.

We are interested in assisting constructive change
which can lead to greater political stability, social
justice, and economic progress. Change must come
from within, following a path dictated by national and
local traditions. In some instances, assistance and
guidance is better provided by other democracies or
multilaterally. Patience, respect for different cultures
and recognition of our own limitations must guide our

effort.

INSTRUMENTS OF
FOREIGN POLICY

The United States has an exceptionally diverse array of
tools for protecting its international interests and for
supporting the drive toward democracy across the
globe. It is possible that no other nation has ever been
comparably endowed. These instruments are normally
most effective when used in concert with others. All of
them must be adapted to changing situations. The
resurgence of our national strength in this decade has
been broadly based. It will endure into the next decade
only if we protect this base and ensure that the tools
available to us are properly sustained and effectively
used. The separate, but interrelated tools on which the
success of our foreign policy depends are:

Moral and political example. American spirit and
prosperity represents a critical challenge to the

 

 

ideology and the practical record of our adversaries:
free, pluralist societies work. This power of example
represents a potent advantage of American society, but
we should not leave its expression to chance. It is in
our interest to spread this message in an organized

way.

Military strength and economic vitality. A strong U.S.
military capability is essential to maintaining the stable,
secure environment in which diplomacy can be
effective and our adversaries are deterred. America’s
economic power sustains this strength and fortifies our
relations with the other countries that share our interest
in a free and open international order.

Alliance relationships. The pursuit of American goals
depends on cooperation with like-minded international
partners. This relationship enhances our strength and
mitigates the understandable reluctance of the
American people to shoulder security burdens alone.
The predictable difficulties that arise from time to time
in all alliance relationships must be measured against
the enormous value that these ties bring us and our
friends,

Security assistance. By helping friends, allies, and
those targeted by our adversaries acquire the means to
defend themselves, we limit the potential of our own
involvement in dangerous conflicts. Security assistance
abroad is productive investment in our own security, It
aids deterrence, promotes regional stability, helps to
ensure access to vital overseas military facilities, and
lessens our own military requirements. Resolute use of
this valuable foreign policy tool directly promotes our
security interests.

Economic assistance. In the decades since World War II,
America has contributed nearly $200 billion to the
economic development of other countries. These
financial resources have played a vital role in ensuring
critical U.S. objectives are met. A well structured
economic assistance program provides essential
support for our world leadership position.

Trade policy. The impact of economic assistance is
maximized when it is matched by a sound trade policy
that facilitates the best use of our assistance. Moreover,
a trade policy that aggravates the economic difficulties
of others may only increase the need for future

10

American assistance. Adherence to the principles of an
open and fair world trading order ensures that
countries acquire the economic strength to stand on
their own feet, and contributes to our own well-being
through mutually beneficial trade. Security
considerations will sometimes require restrained trade
and allied cooperation to prevent enhancing the
military capabilities of our adversaries.

Science and Technology Cooperation. For most
countries, access to advanced scientific and
technological resources is critical to prosperity and
long-term economic growth. U.S. world leadership and
vast resources in science and technology constitute
important strategic assets to strengthen existing ties
with friends and allies, and promote positive
relationships with emerging nations.

Private investment in developing economies. The free
flow of international investment is as central to global
economic growth as an open trading order. U.S, private
investment in less developed countries contributes
significantly to their economic growth and promotes
social stability. At a time when developing countries
are striving to meet their debt-servicing obligations and
the. resources of our national budget are under
pressure, the contribution of private-sector investment
assumes increased importance.

Diplomatic mediation. In regions where conflict
threatens our interests and those of our friends,
political efforts are essential to ending violence,
promoting freedom and national self-determination,
and laying the foundations for future stability. The
initiatives of American diplomacy take their strength
from effective and integrated use of the other tools
already discussed, and from the ability of U.S.
representatives to act credibly as mediators of disputes.
Making clear the firmness of our commitments to
friends and allies will, in fact, increase the incentives of
their adversaries to negotiate seriously.

International Organizations, Multilateral diplomacy
and participation in international organizations provide
an opportunity to address common global problems
and share the task of solving them. Skillful U.S.
diplomacy within these organizations has served to
enhance our overall goals on issues such as

 

 

peacekeeping, promotion of human rights, and
encouraging the development of free economic and
political systems.

Support for Freedom Fighters. The tools of foreign
policy must encompass the special needs of those who
resist the Soviet-style regimes implanted in Third World
countries in the 1970's and 1980's. America has a long
history of private and government support to groups
seeking national independence and freedom. This is a
vital and important effort, as aggressive Marxist-Leninist
regimes clearly threaten international peace and
stability. We seek to advance the cause of freedom and
democracy, and to demonstrate to the Soviets that their
actions aimed at spreading Marxist-Leninist
totalitarianism will bring them no enduring gain.

INTERNATIONAL
ECONOMIC POLICY

The United States supports market-oriented policies
that foster economic growth, both domestically and
internationally. The economic growth of the United
States is the cornerstone that ensures our strength and
permits human potential to flourish. Our policies of
economic growth have provided the underlying base of
support for the most important element in our National
Security Strategy in the past six years—the revitalization
of U.S. military power. The dynamic growth of the U.S.
economy is the envy of much of the world. We are
now working in this country to rebuild American
productivity, sustain our scientific and technological
leadership, make the most of our human potential, and
move into the 21st century with an even more efficient,
capable and competitive American economy. Our
nation will achieve these goals with hard work,
determination, and a commitment to the revitalization
of American industry.

The United States places reliance on private enterprise
and initiative. This philosophy leads to higher living
standards and concern for the economic advancement
of the individual. Our National Security Strategy in the
international economic area seeks to support and
promote market-oriented economic policies which will
maximize economic opportunity and individual
welfare.

It is important to understand why we stress private
enterprise as the basis of our international economic
policy. This is one of the prime areas in which the
United States—and the free world generally—differ in
all respects from the communist world. The Soviet
economic mode! is characterized by the ineffectiveness
of the centralized command economy, the failure of
collective enterprises, and the inability to provide
adequate standards of living for the mass of Soviet
citizens. The Soviet model of economic organization
does not work and will not work.

Under the leadership of General Secretary Gorbachev,
the Soviet Union has announced that it is attempting
fundamental reforms in the management of economic
policy. Recently, Gorbachev invited the Western private
sector, and U.S. business leaders in particular, to
develop a long-term stake in the future of the Soviet
economy. In light of this Soviet initiative, we need to
ask ourselves what kind of Soviet Union we wish to see
in the next twenty or thirty years. Clearly, we can affect
the outcome only at the margin. But we should not
ignore new opportunities for increasing economic
interaction between our two societies. Greater
economic freedom for the Soviet people is in the
interest of the West as long as it does not foster greater
Soviet investment in military capability.

 

But we must approach such interaction with a sense of
realism. There are some areas where it would clearly
not serve constructive purposes. Soviet membership in
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), for
example, would not be in the best interests of the West
at present. In addition to the danger of GATT
politicization, the USSR’s state-directed trading system
is fundamentally incompatible with the free-market
orientation of the GATT international trading system.
Suggestions by Soviet officials about possible USSR
membership in the World Bank or International
Monetary Fund should be treated with caution for
similar reasons, We would oppose such membership
under present circumstances.

The USSR’s effort to broaden its foreign economic
relations forms an integral part of Soviet national
security strategy. In addition to aiding the Soviet
economy, it is designed to exploit dependence of
trading partners and enhance Soviet power and

 

influence generally. Trade with the West can also
provide access to advanced technology which
facilitates the Soviet military buildup. Non-communist
governments need to display greater discipline in
weaving security considerations into the fabric of East-
West commercial relations.

Specifically:

© As recognized in the Helsinki Accords, government-
to-government cooperation in the economic sphere
should be dependent on progress in other areas of
East-West relations, including Eastern observance of
human rights.

® COCOM controls on strategic technologies should
be maintained, streamlined and enforced to restrain
the ability of the Soviet Union and its allies to match
or overtake Western defense capabilities.

© The International Energy Agency (IEA) should
continue its efforts to reduce dependence among
member countries on insecure energy supplies.

Early in our Administration, we laid the international
economic groundwork for greater cooperation with our
allies. We have attempted to foster the view that the
future belongs to those who allow free enterprise to
guide economic decisions and not to those regimes
which allow bureaucratic functionaries to set the
course of economic development. Throughout these six
years, we have witnessed these principles move from
concept into reality. In France, economic liberalization
is steadily progressing. In Japan, slowly but surely, trade
and capital markets are being opened. In Germany and
the United Kingdom, new economic courses are being
set to sustain growth with low inflation.

We believe that market-oriented policies are key to
greater growth in America and throughout the world
over the long-term. We have worked diligently to resist
protectionist tendencies both at home and abroad,
since protectionism will harm all free nations. _
Immediate as well as long term costs would more than
offset any short-term benefits which might be gained.

12

We have encouraged market-based energy policies and
more open energy trade within the International Energy
Agency. We have been the prime movers in laying the
groundwork for a new round of negotiations in the
GATT that will open markets for our exports of goods
and services and stimulate greater growth, efficiency
and worldwide job opportunities. We have forged
stronger ties with our Asian partners by emphasizing
the future role of U.S.Pacific economic relations.

The industrial nations of the West have become
increasingly interdependent. None of these countries
acting alone can effectively resolve long-term economic
problems. The United States and its allies must work
together if we, and the rest of the world, are to prosper
and grow.

Enhancing world economic growth, opening markets,
and ameliorating the developing country debt situation
are long-term goals that can be met only through
sound economic policies, prudent lending, and direct
investment and aid strategies that will elicit the broad
economic development and growing markets needed to
sustain long-term prosperity. Significant contributions of
capital and know-how through aid, investment,
technology transfer and training are as much an
ingredient of regional peace and collective security as
are deterrent forces and defense alliances. This
redefinition of the traditional concept of
“burdensharing” is in keeping with the capabilities of
the United States and our allies and the evolving
responsibilities of shared leadership.

In short, our international economic policy is built
around the belief that economic freedom is not the
sole possession of a chosen few, but the universal right
of all people. We will use our economic power and
political will to preserve and nurture our vision of the
world’s economic future, which belongs to free people,
free governments and free economic enterprises.

 

POLITICAL AND
INFORMATIONAL ELEMENTS
OF NATIONAL POWER

We are faced with a profound challenge to our national
security in the political field. This challenge is to fight
the war of ideas and to help support the political
infrastructure of world democracies. To accomplish this
we must be as committed to the maintenance of our
political defense as we are to our military defense.

Public opinion polls consistently find that two-thirds of
the American electorate normally take no interest in
foreign policy. Moreover, only a bare majority today
believes that this country needs to play an active part
in world affairs—and that majority is eroding. There is
no natural domestic constituency for foreign policy—
we must build one.

_ The instruments to implement such an approach
include a number of traditional foreign policy agencies
such as the Departments of State and Defense, Agency
for International Development (AID), and U.S.
Information Agency (USIA), plus several less traditional
participants including the Departments of Commerce
and Treasury, and the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).

Another actor in the field of political, informational
and communications activity is the private sector.
During the past six years, the private sector has been
energized as a key element in the projection of U.S.
foreign policy goals. Leading private citizens and
groups are taking steps to identify and organize the
many local forces throughout the United States that
have a direct stake in the nation’s relations with the rest
of the world. The private voluntary organizations in
world affairs are doing an indispensible job of public
education. They have our strongest encouragement and
support.

While we focus on the needs of an effective political
and informational policy, we must keep in mind that
the Soviet Union has a most aggressive public

deception and propaganda program, using a wide
range of techniques aimed not only at the Third World,
but also at our alliance partners. The current Soviet
regime has increased the range and intensity of Soviet
public diplomacy and propaganda efforts. We must
actively counter Soviet propaganda and active
measures using the full range of U.S. informational
programs.

Our political and informational strategy must also
reach to the peoples of denied areas, particularly the
USSR and Eastern Europe—to encourage hope for
change and to educate publics on the benefits of free
institutions. This is achieved through the electronic
media, written materials, and the increased contact and
exchange of ideas that come from such contact. The
process of gradual change will take place inside, but
the stimulant and the vision of “how things could be”
must come from outside in a closed society. This is the
vision of a nation which believes that a world of
democracies is a safer world, and one where the
respect for the dignity of all men has a better chance to
be realized. :

REGIONAL POLICIES

Western Hemisphere. The defense of North America is
the nation’s most fundamental security concern. Since
the Second World War this has entailed a hemispheric
security system, composed of a strong U.S. nuclear
deterrent, greater cooperation with Canada, and the
promotion of collective security arrangements with
Latin America. New threats and new opportunities for
democracy in the Western Hemisphere require that this
traditional approach be revitalized by building on the
interests we share with our democratic Caribbean,
North, Central and South American neighbors.

Aggressive Marxist regimes in Cuba and Nicaragua
have made the Western Hemisphere, once considered
indisputably secure for the United States, an area of
strategic opportunity for the Soviet Union. The fragility
of social and political arrangements in Latin America
and the presence of these two Soviet client states, with
their support for guerrilla movements in other Latin
nations and their ties to international terrorism,

13

 

promise continued instability and conflict in the
region. This situation is compounded by continuing
economic and debt-servicing problems, the ongoing
problem of the drug trade and the growing political
strength of the drug traffickers who—often in collusion
with local guerrilla groups—have begun to pose serious
challenges for the reborn Latin democracies.

US. national security policy for the Western
Hemisphere seeks to address these problems within the
broader framework of the promotion of democracy,
fostering economic development, strengthening
dialogue and diplomacy within and among area
countries, and contributing to defensive capabilities
that allow progress without debilitating external
interference, Many of the current challenges for the
United States fall outside of the formal collective
security arrangements created in previous decades. Our
national security requires an emphasis on political and
economic support for the hemisphere’s democracies
and diplomatic initiatives to strengthen alliances.

Western Europe, The security of Western Europe
constitutes a vital interest of the United States. Shared
values, the Soviet threat, and U.S-European economic
interdependence underscore the importance of
collective defense epitomized by NATO,

The two greatest dangers to Western Europe's security
today are the proximity of massive Soviet conventional
and nuclear forces, and the vulnerability of Western
Europe's oil supply, some 60 percent of which moves
by sea from the Persian Gulf.

The cohesion of the NATO Alliance remains strong in
the face of these challenges, and is reinforced by an
intensive process of consultation on the full range of
security issues. Over the past twelve months, there have
been almost thirty high-level consultations at NATO.
This intense process, to which we remain fully
committed, has contributed to the fundament.

Alliance consensus on its approach to East-West
relations on issues ranging from arms control to human
tights. The common Alliance approach, set forth in
recent NATO Ministerial communiques,

combines a commitment to preserving the strength

14

necessary to defend our vital interests with a readiness
to work toward improved relations through a realistic
dialogue with the Soviet Union.

The Alliance has been measurably strengthened in
recent years. The United States has devoted special
attention to rebuilding its Alliance relationships, and
our efforts to reinvigorate the American economy have
provided a major impetus for growth in Western
Europe. Other milestones include the Spanish entry
into NATO in 1982 and last year’s Spanish referendum
in support of continued membership. Through its 1983
and subsequent !ntermediate-range Nuclear Force (INF)
deployments, the Alliance demonstrated its resolve to
protect its basic interests in the face of Soviet
intimidation. In 1984, the Allies launched a program to
improve conventional defense capabilities, and more
recently have focused increased attention on
armaments cooperation. In 1985-86, Allied firmness
and solidarity helped to bring the Soviets back to the
negotiating table in Geneva and to promote progress in
the talks themselves.

Despite the basic vigor and strength of the Atlantic
Alliance, NATO relationships have come under strain
from several quarters, The challenges include, for
example, protectionism and trade deficits, different
methods of dealing with terrorism, burdensharing, and
at times, differing assessments of the Soviet threat.
Moreover, the foreign policy priorities of Western

European governments with respect to developments in

Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America do not
always coincide with U.S. priorities, in part because the
United States must adopt a global outlook.

Doubts have sometimes been expressed, especially in
the late 1970's, over the continued validity of the U.S,
commitment to Europe's defense. The successful
implementation of NATO's 1979 INF dual-track decision
thwarted the most recent Soviet attempt to decouple
the U.S. security guarantee from the defense of Europe,
and has served as a major incentive for the Soviets to
engage in serious negotiations for real reductions in
intermediate-range nuclear forces. Whatever the
outcome of the INF negotiations, flexible response will
require the continuing presence of U.S. nuclear
weapons in Europe. Nonetheless, NATO has

 

 

consistently worked to keep its nuclear arsenal at the
minimum level necessary for deterrence and is
proceeding with the reductions in its stockpile
mandated by the 1983 Montebello decision.

The challenge before us is to maintain the momentum
we have achieved and continue to manage the
inevitable strains in our Alliance relationships. With a
common commitment to the values and interests
which constitute the bedrock of the Alliance,
imagination, and political courage, the United States
and its Allies will succeed in building an even stronger
bulwark against Soviet aggression and intimidation.

East Asia and Pacific. The United States is a Pacific
power and a proud member of the area of the globe
that has led the world’s economies in growth. Soviet
military power in Asia and the Pacific has grown
dramatically, but the U.S. response goes far beyond
technical issues of relative military power. The goal is
to strengthen our natural political and economic
associations, while proceeding steadily with necessary
modernization of our military forces deployed in the
area.

Cooperation with Japan is basic to U.S. relationships in
the region. The U.S-Japan Mutual Security Treaty
formalizes our defense ties, providing a security
foundation for the broad spectrum of economic, social
and political associations which join us.

In the security area, Japan's recent redefinition of its
self-defense goals—especially as they relate to sea lane
protection —is of particular importance. Japanese forces
are developing capabilities that can make a significant
contribution to deterrence. At the same time, Japan's
defense spending remains small as a share of its huge
economy, and more rapid progress is needed toward
Japan's defense goals. But the constant and substantial
growth of that spending over the last fifteen years, and
particularly over the last five years, is significant. Japan’s
recent decision to spend more than one percent of its
GNP on defense is especially noteworthy.

Japan is now the world’s second greatest economic
power. This development is reflected in increased
Japanese expenditures on foreign assistance, which it
continues to target on key strategic countries. At the

same time, Japanese economic relations have become
a source of political tension. The Japanese trade
surplus is the biggest in history. This surplus cannot be
sustained and must be brought into better balance. We
are working together on many fronts to do this.

Our alliance with the Republic of Korea remains of
exceptional importance. North Korea still has armed
forces that far exceed those of the South in quantity, are
newly strengthened by additional Soviet weapons, and
are in the hands of a government whose aggressive
demeanor and tendency to act unexpectedly is well
known. Our own military presence in the Republic of
Korea is of importance, both for regional stability and
for local security, which is essential to that country’s
remarkable economic development. It now faces a
critical period of political development as well, as it
moves toward a first-ever peaceful change of
government when President Chun’s term will be
completed in 1988. In this process, the United States
hopes to use its influence to encourage Koreans in this
democratic change. We do so, however, in careful ways
that respect Korean traditions and political realities, and
are mindful of the constant security threat.

China's importance speaks for itself. Its attainment of
rapid economic growth, while simultaneously making
basic economic, social and political changes, is
another great achievement in its remarkable history.
The United States seeks a close, friendly, and
cooperative relationship with the People’s Republic of
China, outside any alliance, and without any illusions
that one is a political or strategic “card” for the other.
Simply put, both of us recognize the importance of
each to the other in the many shared areas of
agreement, even as we appreciate the diversity of our
political systems.

In the Philippines, the new government faces major
and inherited political, security and economic
challenges. Through all of the tools available to us, we
are det. “yined to help this key Pacific ally to overcome
these probiems so it can once again achieve economic
growth, counter the threat of a serious insurgency and
strengthen democratic government.

Our second treaty ally in Southeast Asia, Thailand, is
the ASEAN frontline state bordering Cambodia, now _

15

 

 

occupied by the Vietnamese and the site of an active
Cambodian resistance coalition struggling to gain self-
determination for the Khmer people. In support of
Thailand, which also shoulders the major refugee
burden in Southeast Asia, we will continue our close
security cooperation to deter any potential aggression
and maintain our support of eligible refugees. We will
also continue our cooperative effort with Thailand to
suppress narcotic trafficking.

The United States views the continued occupation of
Cambodia by Vietnamese forces as unacceptable as it
undermines regional efforts towards development,
peace and stability. We also oppose the return of the
Khmer Rouge to power in Cambodia. We will continue
our strong support of ASEAN’s quest for a peaceful
political solution and for the non-Communist elements
of the resistance coalition. Under our initiative on
regional problems at the United Nations, we are

prepared to play a constructive role in the context of a

Cambodian settlement.

Despite acute and serious differences with Vietnam,
through bilateral discussions we have made more
progress in accounting for our missing servicemen in
the past two years than at any time since the end of the
war. Similarly, our bilateral discussions on the
humanitarian question of refugees, reeducation of
internees and Amerasians will continue with the
objective of a humane solution to these complex
questions. We will not, however, resume normalization
of relations with Vietnam until Hanoi agrees to a
Cambodian settlement involving withdrawal of its
occupation forces, ~

We have seen a modest but welcome improvement in
relations between Laos and the United States. Our
primary measure of their sincerity to improve relations
is further, accelerated, cooperative efforts to account for
our servicemen still missing.

In the South Pacific, our longstanding alliance with
Australia under the ANZUS Treaty remains the keystone
of our foreign policy in the area. The United States has
been especially aware of the needs of the South Pacific
independent states. We recently reached agreement on
the key elements of an historic fisheries treaty. We are
pleased with this agreement which creates a solid

16

foundation for future friendship and cooperation. We
believe that the package of U.S, assistance that is linked
to the treaty will encourage development of the island
economies. We also were recently able to celebrate the
creation of a new U.S. Commonwealth—The Northern
Marianas—and two new freely associated states, the
Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the
Marshalls, We welcome these new participants to the
Pacific Ocean community.

The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. As mentioned
earlier, the most significant threat to U.S. security and
national interests is the global! challenge posed by the
Soviet Union. There is no doubt that Moscow aspires
to alter the existing international system and establish
Soviet global hegemony. These Soviet long-range
objectives are underwritten by Soviet concepts of
foreign and defense policy. Our policy for dealing with
the Soviets rests on three guiding principles:

© Realism, which means that we must recognize the
nature of the Soviet system and deal frankly and
forthrightly with problems in our relationship.

* Strength, which is more than military power, but
includes political determination, the strength of ..
alliances, and economic health as well. The Soviet
Union respects strength and takes advantage of
weakness.

© Dialogue, which means that we are prepared to
discuss all the issues that divide us, and are ready
to work for practical and fair solutions on a basis
compatible with our own fundamental interests.

Consistent with this approach, we are engaged in
dialogues with the Soviets on four basic elements of
our relationship: human rights; the reduction of
tegional conflicts; areas of mutually beneficial
cooperation; and arms control. In all areas, progress is
slow.

At the same time, through coordinated employment of
many elements of our national power, we seek to deter
further Soviet direct and indirect aggression, and

.achieve a lessened Soviet reliance on the use or threat

of force. We will continue to counter Soviet
expansionism worldwide. No additional country has
fallen to Soviet aggression since 1981, and the Soviets

 

 

 

have been more cautious in undertaking new military
adventures in recent years, though they and their
proxies remain active in such areas as Afghanistan,
Angola, Cambodia, and Nicaragua.

In short, we have put in place a policy designed for
long-term management of U.S-Soviet relations in order
to pursue our interests without the rapid fluctuations or
unrealistic illusions which characterized some periods
in the past. The fundamental fact is that the U.S.Soviet
relationship is essentially adversarial, and will remain
so for the foreseeable future. But both sides agree that
we have a responsibility to ensure that this relationship
remains peaceful. We are ready for the long effort and
steady course required to pursue our national interests
in this fashion.

The United States has important political and
economic interests in Eastern Europe. We have never
recognized the division of Europe as either lawful or
permanent. There was no agreement at Yalta to divide
Europe into “spheres of influence.’ Rather, the Soviet
Union pledged itself to grant full independence to
Poland and to other states in Eastern Europe and to
hold free elections. Soviet failure to honor these
commitments is one of the primary causes of East-West
tensions today. Our policy toward Eastern Europe seeks
to promote a positive role for Eastern European states
in preserving European stability and exercising a
moderating influence on the Soviet Union.

We believe the United States should deal with the East
European countries on an individual basis and vary our
policies depending upon our assessment of the
conditions in each nation. In keeping with this
principle, we differentiate our policies toward Eastern
Europe to achieve a variety of objectives. These include
the encouragement of domestic liberalization and
more autonomous foreign policies; promotion of
security through enhanced economic and political
cooperation; and the fostering of genuine and long-
lasting improvement in human rights. Concurrently, we
seek to promote increased dialogue through cultural
and scientific exchanges, international forums, high-
level visits, bilateral councils and people-to-people
contacts.

The Middle East and South Asia. Our principal
interests in the Middle East include maintaining
regional stability, containing and reducing Soviet
influence, preserving the security of Israel and our
other friends in the area, retaining access to oil on
reasonable terms for ourselves and our allies, and
curbing state-sponsored terrorism. Those interests are
threatened by the continuation of the Iran-Iraq conflict,
the existence of deep-seated Arab-Israeli tensions, the
growth of anti-Western political movements in the
region, and the use of terrorism as an instrument of
state policy, particularly by Libya, Syria, and Iran. Our
strategy in the region aims to safeguard our interests
from those threats; to hasten negotiated settlements of
the Palestinian problem and the Iran-Iraq war; to
bolster the security and economic well-being of Israel
and moderate Arab regimes; to help our friends in the
Gulf protect themselves and international shipping
lanes; and to isolate and deter state sponsors of
terrorism.

The U.S. Initiative of September 1982 remains the
cornerstone of our approach to the Arab-Israeli peace
process. Our immediate goal is direct negotiations
between Israel and a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation,
as part of a general effort to broaden the Egyptian-
Israeli peace and bring about a just and lasting
resolution of the Palestinian problem. We remain firmly
committed to a prompt and honorable negotiated
settlement of the Iran-Iraq war. Current Iranian behavior
poses a serious threat to our interests and those of our
friends in the region. Until Iran ceases its efforts to
prolong the senseless war with Iraq, we will work
actively to block the flow of arms and military material
to Iran.

 

Despite severe budgetary constraints, economic and
security assistance, together with a prudent but
responsive policy of arms sales within the region,
remains an essential part of our efforts to strengthen
Israel and moderate Arab regimes. We cannot afford to
neglect the real needs of our friends. At the same time,
we will continue to try to isolate and build interna-
tional pressure against state sponsors of terrorism. Our
recent actions against Libya were designed to
demonstrate the political, military and economic

17

 

costs of supporting terrorism. While we have no
illusions about eradicating this menace easily or
quickly, we remain determined to combat it vigorously
_in close cooperation with our friends and allies.

U.S. objectives.in South Asia include reduction of
regional tensions; development of cooperative
relationships between South Asian countries;
prevention of nuclear proliferation; and restoration of
the freedom of the Afghan people.

US. policy also seeks a general improvement in
bilateral relations with all countries of the
subcontinent. Important elements have been improved
India-U.S, relations and U.S. encouragement of better
relations between India and Pakistan. A new six-year
assistance plan of $4 billion for Pakistan has been
proposed by this Administration and is vital to that
country’s ability to withstand strong pressures
generated by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Pakistan is hosting nearly three million Afghan refugees
on its soil. The United States remains the largest donor
of humanitarian assistance to the refugees.

For the first time, the United States has established
substantially improved relations with both India and
Pakistan. This enables us to help support the regional
desire for peace, despite periodic crises in Indo-
Pakistani relations.

Africa. African issues demand increasing attention

18

because of the continent's extensive natural resources;
its growing role in international forums; the threat
posed to regional security by the escalating racial
conflict in South Africa; and Soviet, Libyan, East
European and Cuban adventurism throughout the
region. The challenges to democracy are especially
strong in Africa, and we remain concerned about the
widespread denial of basic human rights, whether by
Marxist-Leninst clients of the Soviet Union or through
apartheid in South Africa. The sources of conflict
within Africa are many: extreme poverty, great
disparities of wealth, ethnic frictions, unsettled borders,
and religion.

U.S. policy must strive to encourage economic
development and political stability in Africa. African
leaders have started to recognize that statist solutions
are not the answer and are beginning to reform their
economies. We must work with other donor countries
and the multilateral institutions to reinforce this trend
toward economic policy reform and private sector
development.

Economic growth will contribute to, but also requires,
political stability. We must continue to encourage the
peaceful resolution of conflicts without foreign
intervention. Deteriorating economic conditions and
political instability have encouraged intervention by the
Soviets, their surrogates, the Cubans, and maverick
troublemakers like Libya.

 

IV. U.S. Defense Policy

INTRODUCTION

The Defense Policy of the United States requires
military forces that are organized, manned, trained, and
equipped to deter and, if necessary, defeat aggression
across the entire spectrum of potential conflict. Our
National Security Strategy, global objectives, and the
nature of the threat require that we be prepared to
defend our interests as far from North America as
possible. Accordingly, our strategy relies heavily on
forward deployment of combat-ready forces, reinforced
by strong alliance relationships. In support of those
relationships, we will continue to maintain in
peacetime major forward deployments of land, naval,
and air forces in Europe, the Atlantic and the Pacific;
and other deployments in the Western Hemisphere and
Indian Ocean. The overall size and composition of our
armed forces are strongly influenced by these
requirements.

The challenge we face is dynamic and complex. There
remains a significant imbalance of forces favoring the
Soviet Union in several important contingencies. In
addition, Third World states are increasingly armed
with modern and sophisticated military equipment.

Comprehensive and imaginative integration of U.S. and
allied military capabilities is required to reduce risks to
our national security. Since our political and social
heritage militates against raising and supporting large
forces in peacetime, we are impelled to seek security
in Americas national genius for technological
innovation; the breadth and diversity of our national
economy; and alliance cooperation. The United States
must pursue strategies for competition with the Soviets
which emphasize our comparative advantages in these
areas.

The full range of U.S. military capabilities must be
suitably balanced among combat and support
elements, and contain an appropriate mix of active
duty and reserve components. The United States must
have specialized forces—ranging from those required
for nuclear deterrence to forces configured to deal with
terrorism; and must also have general purpose forces
capable of sustaining high intensity conflict, while
maintaining an effective capability for lesser
contingencies and special operations. At the same time,
we must balance defense priorities among the
competing needs of readiness, sustainability,
modernization, and force expansion.

U.S. military forces also must be supported by plans,
doctrines, and command relationships which provide
for effective integration and employment of all facets of
our military power. While the possible use of nuclear
weapons must remain an element in our overall
military strategy, nuclear forces should never be viewed
as simply a lower-cost alternative to conventional
forces. U.S. forces must be capable of rapid deployment
to deter wider crises or conflicts. They must also
possess the capability, should deterrence fail, to expand
the scope and intensity of combat operations, as
necessary, to terminate the conflict on terms favorable
to the United States and its allies.

The United States must maintain effective and robust
Reserve and National Guard forces, trained and
equipped at levels commensurate with their wartime
missions, as well as Coast Guard and other capabilities
which support the national security establishment. The
United States must also continue to enhance its
capabilities to surge or mobilize manpower and key
industrial resources, planning for the most effective use
of available strategic warning in the event of crisis or
war.

19

 

TAKING ADVANTAGE OF U.S.
STRENGTHS AND SOVIET
WEAKNESSES

One of the central tenets of our defense policy is that
the United States will not seek to match the Soviet
Union weapon for weapon. Rather, we will work to
overcome Soviet numerical superiority by taking
maximum advantage of the inherent strengths of
alliances composed of democratic, industrialized, free
economy nations.

Technology. The United States and its allies continue to
enjoy technological superiority over the Soviet Bloc in
most areas of military application. This technological
advantage derives from the fundamental nature of the
two societies. The spirit of inquiry and the free flow of
information which characterize the West will inevitably
permit technology and innovation to flourish to a
greater degree than it will in a closed society. The
United States and its allies enjoy an intrinsic advantage
not only in the creation, but in the practical
exploitation of advanced technologies. Competitive,
free-enterprise societies consistently out-perform
centrally planned economies in fostering innovation,
growth, and the application of new technology to a
wide variety of fields.

Technology affects our national security in two ways.
First, the ability to exploit and adapt technology
contributes to the overall economic health of the
United States and its allies, which is a key element of
national power. Second, the exploitation of a
technological advantage directly enhances defense.
Precision guided munitions, for example, help offset
the large Soviet edge in tank forces. Stealth technology
helps counter the massive Soviet investment in air
defense. Advances in anti-submarine warfare
technologies and in submarine quieting help preserve
maritime superiority despite the Soviet Navy's
numerical advantages. Perhaps most significantly, the
U.S, edge in computer technology and software has
military relevance across the entire spectrum of
warfare.

The Soviets are, of course, conscious of the Western
technological advantage and have undertaken a

20

massive effort to acquire and exploit Western
technology. Thus a vital element of our defense policy
is to contro! technology transfer and protect classified
information relating to military technologies. With this
in mind, we have undertaken a major effort to enhance
our National Counter-intelligence and Security
Countermeasures plans and capabilities, as | outlined
in my November 1986 report to Congress.

Competitive Strategies. Competitive strategies are
aimed at exploiting our technological advantages in
thoughtful and systematic ways to cause the Soviets to
compete less efficiently or less effectively in areas of
military application. Such strategies seek to make
portions of the tremendous Soviet military machine
obsolete and force the Soviets to divert resources in
ways they may not prefer, and in a manner that may not
necessarily threaten our own forces. Low observable
(stealth) technology, for example, can render much of
the Soviet investment in air defense obsolete and
requires the Soviets to divert resources from offensive
forces to defensive forces. The contribution which new
technologies can make to our competitive strategies is
an explicit consideration in making defense
procurement decisions.

Alliances. A third area of U.S. strength and Soviet
weakness is alliance relationships. While the Soviet
Union presides over an empire that has seen several
armed rebellions in the past forty years, the United
States is the leader of a voluntary coalition of equal
nations. U.S. allies, particularly our NATO partners,
contribute a major share of the West's total military
strength. Recognizing this contribution, our defense
policy is based on the fundamental premise that we
will not seek to offset Soviet power alone, but in
conjunction with our allies throughout the globe, on a
basis of equitable burdensharing. .

In NATO, this means continuing our strong support for
Alliance efforts to improve the overall Western
conventional balance, including appropriate economic
and military assistance to allies on NATO’s critical
southern flank. It means integrating the contribution of
our NATO partners into our strategy—indeed, the
United States has no separate military strategy for the
defense of Europe, but is a partner in the NATO
alliance strategy of deterrence and defense. Outside of
Europe, the United States seeks strong ties with nations

 

 

throughout the globe, assisting friendly and allied
countries in improving their military capabilities while
encouraging them to assume a greater role in their own
defense.

The Strength of the Individual. One of our greatest
advantages in competing with the Soviet Union is the
character of our people. Western societies, with their
stress on the importance of the individual, stand in
sharp contrast to the repressive nature of the Soviet
state. The initiative, enterprise, and motivation of free
people is a source of great strength when individuals
are put to the supreme test of combat. While
intangible, these qualities are an important asset, which
the Soviets cannot match. Defense policy recognizes
this by stressing unit integrity and leadership, while our
training and tactics place great value on individual
initiative, and aggressive exploitation of opportunities.

MAINTENANCE OF A
STRATEGIC DETERRENT

Deterrence is the most fundamental element of our
defense policy and the cornerstone of our alliance
relationships. Deterrence must not only prevent
conventional and nuclear attack on the United States,
but must extend such protection to our allies.
Deterrence can best be achieved if our defense posture
makes the assessment of war outcome by the Soviets,
or any other adversary, so dangerous and uncertain as
to remove any possible incentive for initiating conflict.
Deterrence depends both on nuclear and conventional
capabilities, and on evidence of a strong will to use
military force, if necessary, to defend our vital interests.

While deterrence requires capabilities across the entire
spectrum of conflict, its essential foundation is
provided by our strategic nuclear forces and the
doctrine which supports them. Nuclear deterrence, like
any form of deterrence, requires us to consider not
what would deter us, but what would deter the Soviets,
whose perceptions of the world and value system are
substantially different from our own. Since we can
never be entirely certain of Soviet perceptions, it is of
the utmost importance that the effectiveness of our

strategic capabilities—and our will to use them, if
necessary—never be in doubt.

In the interest of ensuring deterrence, the United States
maintains diversified strategic forces to hedge against a
disarming first strike, complicate Soviet attack plans,
and guard against technological surprise which might
threaten one element of our strategic forces. To this
end, we maintain a variety of basing modes, launch
platforms, and attack vehicles, achieving diversity
through a triad of SLBMs, ICBMs and bombers.
Adequate and survivable command and control is an
essential element of strategic force structure, and is
ctitical to the credibility of our strategic deterrent.

Our strategic forces and the associated targeting policy
must, by any calculation, be perceived as making
nuclear warfare a totally unacceptable and unrewarding
proposition for the Soviet leadership. Accordingly, our
strategy:

Denies the Soviets the ability to achieve essential
military objectives by holding at risk Soviet
warmaking capabilities. This includes the entire
range of Soviet military forces, as well as the war
supporting industry which provides the foundation
for Soviet military power, and supports its capability
to conduct a protracted conflict.

© Places at risk those political entities the Soviet
leadership values most: the mechanisms for ensuring
survival of the Communist Party and its leadership
cadres, and for retention of the Party's control over
the Soviet and Soviet Bloc peoples.

This basic strategy of targeting those assets which are
essential to Soviet warmaking capability and political
control has been U.S. policy for many years. In
implementing this strategy, the United States does not
target population as an objective in itself and seeks to

‘minimize collateral damage through more accurate,

lower yield weapons.

We cannot permit any President to be faced with a
situation in which the only available responses to
aggression are capitulation or massive destruction.

21

 

Thus, in addition to holding at risk the full range of
assets important to the Soviet leadership, the United
States also requires flexibility in the employment of its
strategic forces. It is essential that we have response
options appropriate to the broad range of plausible
situations. This flexible response capability bolsters the
credibility of our deterrent by making clear to the
Soviets that the United States has a variety of military
options with which to respond to aggression.

Finally, the United States also requires sufficient
residual capability to provide leverage for early war
termination, and to avoid coercion in a post-conflict
world. For this reason, we maintain a nuclear reserve
force as an integral part of our strategic forces. We also
maintain Continuity of Government programs as an
essential element of deterrence to assure the Soviets
they cannot escape retaliation by a quick,
“decapitating” attack aimed at incapacitating U.S.
political and military leadership.

These capabilities do not imply the United States seeks
to fight a nuclear war. | have repeatedly emphasized
that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be
fought. But we seek to deter an adversary with a very
different strategic outlook from our own—an outlook
which places great stress on nuclear warfighting
capability. It is essential the Soviets understand that
they cannot gain their objectives through nuclear
warfare under any conceivable circumstances. To
achieve this we must ensure that they clearly perceive
that the United States has the capability to respond
appropriately to any Soviet attempt to wage a nuclear
war, and that we have the means to do this in ways
which will defeat Soviet military objectives without
necessarily triggering a massive nuclear exchange.

Strategic Defenses, Our policy of flexible response and
deterrence through the threat of offensive retaliation
has preserved the security of the United States and its
allies for decades, At the same time, the Soviet strategic
force buildup has threatened the foundation on which
deterrence has long rested. Looking to the future, the
U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative offers an opportunity to
shift deterrence to a safer and more stable basis
through greater reliance on strategic defenses. Such
defenses, which threaten no one, could substantially

22

enhance deterrence by injecting great uncertainties into
Soviet estimates of their ability to achieve their
essential military objectives in a first strike. “Leak proof”
defenses would not be required initially in order to
deny the Soviets confidence that they could achieve
meaningful military goals. Even less than perfect
defenses could significantly increase stability by
eliminating plausible incentives for a Soviet first strike.
In judging the suitability of systems for possible
deployment, we will continue to be guided by the
criteria of military effectiveness, survivability, and cost-
effectiveness at the margin.

By reducing the military value of ballistic missiles, and
ultimately rendering them obsolete, strategic defenses
would also provide incentives for Soviet acceptance of
significant arms reduction agreements. In a world with
fewer ballistic missiles, however, Soviet incentives to
cheat would be greater. Strategic defenses can
effectively negate these incentives by eliminating the
military utility of covertly stockpiled missiles. Thus,
they offer the prospect of a safer, more stable world in
which deep reductions in strategic offensive arms are
both negotiable and enforceable.

 

In short, the pursuit of strategic defenses has the
potential to bring about the most significant change in
U.S. National Security Strategy since the end of World
War Il. By allowing us to move away from reliance on
the threat of massive destruction to deter aggression,
strategic defenses would change the entire U.S.-Soviet
strategic relationship in a positive way, increasing the
safety and security of the peoples of both nations and
their allies. We will continue to try to persuade the
Soviets to join with us in working out a stable
transition to this sensible and attainable goal.

US. Strategic Modernization Program. Continuing U.S.
strategic modernization is essential to assure reliable
deterrence, enhance stability, and provide motivation
for the Soviets to negotiate broad, deep, equitable and
verifiable reductions in strategic offensive arms. While
we are firmly committed to using arms control as one
component of our policy for enhancing U.S. and allied
security, it would be exceptionally dangerous to
anticipate success in arms control. Indeed, neglecting
strategic modernization in expectation of arms
reduction agreements would have the perverse effect of
decreasing the likelihood of such agreements by

 

reducing one of the principal Soviet incentives to
agreement.

History shows that a demonstrated will to maintain a
military balance with the Soviets and not allow them to
gain a significant strategic advantage is an essential
foundation for serious arms contro! negotiations. It was
U.S. action to rectify imbalances which brought the
Soviets to consider the major force reductions
discussed at Reykjavik. Even if we are successful in
achieving the agreements we seek, however, thé United
States will continue to require modernized, mission-
effective, and survivable nuclear forces to provide
deterrence, promote stability, and hedge against Soviet
cheating or abrogation during the transition to new,
lower force levels.

For their part, the Soviets continue to invest heavily in
strategic modernization, with emphasis on accurate,
fast-flying ballistic missiles which can destroy hard
targets, Their goal has been, and remains, attainment of
an effective disarming first-strike capability. They have
always sought to enhance their ICBM survivability
through silo hardening. Recently they have also sought
to do so through mobility, including continued
deployment of the road-mobile SS-25, and preparation
for deployment of the rail-based SS-X-24.

At the same time, the Soviets continue to invest roughly
the same amount in their strategic defense programs as
in their offensive force modernization. They are
expanding and improving the world’s only deployed
ABM system. They continue to violate the ABM Treaty
with their radar at Krasnoyarsk, enhancing their ability
to break out of the Treaty through rapid deployment of
a nation-wide ABM system. Their extensive civil
defense program includes a vast and growing network
of deep underground leadership shelters aimed at
ensuring the survival of Communist Party control over
the Soviet nation, economy, and military forces in war.
Their strategic communications are highly redundant,
survivable, and hardened against nuclear effects. Their
active and passive defenses, their unrelenting buildup
of offensive forces, and their published doctrine all
provide evidence of the Soviet nuclear warfighting
mentality, and underline the absolute essentiality of
maintaining the effectiveness of the U.S. strategic
deterrent.

To this end, in 1981 we undertook the Strategic
Modernization Program in order to maintain the
essential survivability and effectiveness of our own
forces in the face of the continuing qualitative and
quantitative upgrade in the Soviet threat. Current
elements of that program, which remains our highest
defense priority, include:

Improved strategic command, control and
communications, to ensure timely warning of attack
and an assured means of passing retaliatory orders to
our strategic forces.

© ICBM modernization, centered on the PEACEKEEPER
(MX) and Small ICBM, both of which will have
enhanced survivability through mobility.

© SLBM modernization, including deployment of the
TRIDENT submarine and development and
deployment of the TRIDENT II missile.

© Bomber and cruise missile upgrades, including
deployment of the B-1B, and the exploitation of the
important U.S, lead in low-observable technology by
development of the Advanced Technology Bomber
and the Advanced Cruise Missile.

© Strategic Defense programs, including SDI and the
Air Defense Initiative, to redress the long-standing
neglect of defensive programs generally, and to
capitalize on the potential which modern
technology offers for radically transforming the basis
for deterrence and laying the foundation for a far
more safe and stable strategic relationship with the
Soviet Union.

ARMS CONTROL

Arms control is not an end in itself but an integral part
of our overall National Security Strategy. It must be
viewed as only one of several tools to enhance our
national security and to promote our fundamental
national interest in thé survival of the United States as
a free and independent nation. Our arms control
objectives are fully integrated with our defense and
foreign policies to enhance deterrence, reduce risk,
support alliance relationships, and ensure the Soviets
do not gain significant unilateral advantage over the
United States.

23

 

Based on this view of arms control as a complement to
a strong national defense posture, U.S. arms control
policy, since the beginning of this Administration, has
been guided by several fundamental principles:

© The United States seeks only those agreements
which contribute to our security and that of our
allies.

¢ The United States seeks agreements which reduce
arms, not simply codify their increase.

¢ Achieving agreements on broad, deep and equitable
reductions in offensive nuclear arms is the highest
arms control priority of the United States.

¢ Within the category of offensive nuclear arms, the

. United States gives priority to reducing the most
destabilizing weapons: fast-flying, non-recallable
ballistic missiles.

© The United States also seeks equitable arms control
measures in the area of nuclear testing, chemical
weapons and conventional forces.

¢ The United States insists on agreements that can be
effectively verified and fully complied with. Arms
control agreements without effective verification
measures are worse than no agreements at all as
they create the possibility of Soviet unilateral
advantage, and can affect U.S. and allied planning
with a false sense of confidence.

These principles contrast sharply with the Soviet arms
control approach. The Soviets have historically sought
to exploit the arms control process to gain unilateral
advantage by shifting the military balance in their favor.
At the same time, they have pursued additional
advantage by failing to comply with important
provisions of existing arms control agreements, secure
in the knowledge that the United States does not cheat
and can be relied on for full compliance with
agreements in force.

This approach has proven at least partially successful
for the Soviets in the past. The arms control agreements
of the 1970s largely legitimized the planned Soviet
strategic buildup, while constraining our own force
modernization by reducing public support for essential
strategic programs. Typical of the defects of the past
was the SALT II Treaty of 1979, a fundamentally flawed
agreement which was never ratified. Unequal and

24

unverifiable in important provisions, it was inimical to
the security interests of the United States and its allies,
and to the stability of the U.S.Soviet strategic
relationship.

Imperfect as these earlier arms control agreements
were, their faults have been compounded by the
Soviets’ failure to abide by key provisions—a failure
which persists today. They encrypt telemetry associated
with ballistic missile testing in a manner which
impedes verification. They have deployed a prohibited
second new type of ICBM, the $S-25, and exceeded the
numerical limit on strategic nuclear delivery vehicles.
The Soviets have also violated the SALT I Interim
Agreement of 1972; and with respect to the ABM Treaty,
as noted earlier, the Krasnoyarsk radar remains a clear
violation.

As a result of both U.S. concerns with the SALT
structure and the poor Soviet compliance record, |
determined in May 1986 that, in the future, the United
States would base decisions regarding its strategic force
structure on the nature and magnitude of the threat
posed by Soviet strategic forces, and not on standards .
contained in a flawed, unratified, and expired treaty
which has been repeatedly violated by the Soviet
Union. At the same time | indicated that—assuming no
significant change in the threat we face—the United
States will not deploy more strategic nuclear delivery
vehicles, or more strategic ballistic missile warheads,
than does the Soviet Union. Thus, while ensuring an
adequate strategic deterrent, the United States will
continue to exercise the utmost restraint, in order to
foster the necessary atmosphere for obtaining Soviet
agreement to significant reductions.

While the United States’ priority objective in arms
control is deep reductions in strategic offensive arms,
we are also engaged in a wide variety of negotiations
and discussions on other subjects. The U.S. approach
to all of these areas is consistent. We seek only those
agreements which are equitable, verifiable, and will
enhance our security and that of our allies.

Specifically:

© In the area of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(INF), we seek the complete elimination of an entire

 

class of weapons: land-based longer-range INF
(LRINF) missiles. As an interim goal, we seek a
global agreement limiting the U.S. and USSR to 100
LRINF missile warheads each, to be deployed in
Soviet Asia and the United States, with none of either
side in Europe.

© Consistent with our belief that strategic defenses may
offer a safer, more stable basis for deterrence, we
seek Soviet agreement for an orderly transition to a
more defense-reliant world.

© We have proposed an effectively verifiable global
ban on chemical weapons.

© We seek alliance-to-alliance negotiations to establish
a more stable balance in conventional forces from
the Atlantic to the Urals, at lower levels. Such
reductions must be effectively verifiable and must
recognize the geographic asymmetries between the
two sides.

¢ In the area of nuclear testing, we seek essential
verification improvements to permit ratification of
existing treaties: the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, and
the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty. Once our
verification concerns have been satisfied and the
ratification process is complete, we would be
prepared immediately to engage in negotiations with
the Soviets on ways to implement a step-by-step
program to limit and ultimately end nuclear testing,
in association with a program to reduce and
ultimately eliminate all nuclear weapons.

© Finally, we seek to improve stability through
improved measures which could prevent
misunderstanding during periods of crisis. We have
made progress on such measures at the recently
concluded Stockholm conference.

In all of these areas we consider effective verification to
be equally as important as specific negotiated limits;
they should be negotiated concurrently. We cannot
accept obligations that limit our military programs
unless we can effectively verify Soviet compliance with
those same obligations. This is particularly important in
light of the continuing pattern of Soviet violations
documented in the several reports which | have
submitted to the Congress on Soviet non-compliance.

Substantial progress toward the achievement of U.S.
arms control goals was made at the October 1986
meeting in Iceland between General Secretary
Gorbachev and myself. At that meeting we agreed on
the outlines of a 50 percent reduction in strategic
offensive forces and a dramatic global reduction in INF
missiles. In the near-term, our primary focus will be to
work toward agreement in these areas. Consistent with
our priority on radically reducing the most
destabilizing strategic systems—and in response to the
Soviet desire for a ten-year commitment not to
withdraw from the ABM Treaty—we proposed to accept
such a commitment through 1996, during which time
research, development and testing, which is permitted
by the ABM Treaty, would continue. At the same time,
the proposed agreement provided for:

© A fifty percent reduction in strategic offensive forces
of the United States and Soviet Union during the first
five years of the ten year period.

© Elimination of all U.S. and Soviet offensive ballistic
missiles of whatever range or armament during the
second five years.

© Agreement that either side could deploy advanced
strategic defenses after the ten-year period, unless
both agreed not to do so.

It is too soon to foresee the future course of arms
control following Reykjavik. Much depends on the
attitude of the Soviet Union. The United States has
tabled proposals in the Geneva negotiations reflecting
the areas agreed on in Iceland; the Soviet Union has
tabled proposals that only partially reflect the
achievements of Reykjavik. If the Soviets maintain their
current attempt to hold all progress hostage to U.S.
agreement to kill the Strategic Defense Initiative,
prospects for progress are dim. On the other hand, if
they are willing to implement the agreements reached
in Reykjavik, we can move now to achieve greater
stability and a safer world. In moving to that world, |
will maintain my commitment to broad, deep,
equitable, and verifiable reductions, focused especially
on ballistic missiles, and my equally strong
commitment to the Strategic Defense Initiative as a
basis for moving to a safer, more stable form of
deterrence.

 

Finally, ! should emphasize that the measure of success
in arms control is not the number of meetings held or
agreements signed. Rather it is whether those
agreements which are signed contribute to U.S, and
allied security and advance the cause of peace and
stability. Because of this, while the United States will
remain both creative and patient, it will continue to
reject calls for agreements which do not enhance U.S.
and allied security and contribute to global stability

MAINTENANCE OF A
CONVENTIONAL DETERRENT

Forward Deployed Conventional Defense Capability.
Strategic nuclear capabilities are essential for
deterrence, but they alone are obviously not enough.
The United States and its allies require robust
conventional forces as an integral part of our overall
deterrent. The U.S. National Security Strategy is built
on the concepts of forward defense and alliance
solidarity. Consistent with this strategy, we maintain
large, forward deployed forces at sea and on the
territory of our NATO and Asian allies in time of peace.
The overall size and capabilities of U.S. armed services
are heavily influenced by the need to maintain such
presence, which is essential to deter aggression.

The most demanding threat with which those forces
must be prepared to deal is, of course, the Soviet
threat. Soviet forces may always outnumber our own—
even when allied forces are thrown into the balance.
For this reason, we must give the most careful attention
to maintaining our forces’ qualitative superiority at the
level necessary to accomplish their deterrent and
warfighting missions,

An additional premise of American defense policy is
that the United States does not seek to deal with the
threat from the Soviet Union unaided. A system of
vigorous alliances is the only effective way to deter the
Soviets. The most important of these alliances is NATO,
which for over a generation has preserved peace and
security in Europe. While no single NATO partner can
match the massive Soviet conventional forces, together
we are capable of fielding a powerful deterrent.

26

U.S. Contribution to NATO. The United States
contributes to this NATO deterrent in several ways.
Most visible is the peacetime stationing of over
300,000 military personnel in the European theater,
Although our allies contribute the majority of the
conventional forces in Europe, and would continue to
do so in crisis and mobilization, the presence of U.S.
forces makes it clear that it is not possible to attack a
NATO ally without simultaneously engaging the full
military might of the United States.

In addition to the direct provision of forces, the United
States provides security assistance to those NATO allies
whose economies do not permit them to make as great
a contribution to the common defense as they and we
would wish. Such assistance serves as an important
and cost-effective force multiplier, increasing both the
political solidarity and the military effectiveness of
NATO. Finally, the United States provides the main
contribution to the nuclear umbrella over NATO which
has been one of the pillars of NATO's strategy for
decades.

The Strategy of Flexible Response. NATO's deterrent
strategy requires a capability for flexible response,
appropriate to the nature of Soviet provocation. In
addition to robust U.S. and allied conventional forces,
backed by the strategic nuclear capability of the United
States, this strategy must be supported by effective and
substantial non-strategic nuclear forces as well. The
United States contributes to all legs of the “NATO
Triad”: conventional forces, non-strategic nuclear forces,
and strategic forces. NATO's 1979 decision to
modernize its nuclear forces through deployment of
Ground Launched Cruise Missiles and Pershing II
ballistic missiles helped to redress the imbalance
created by the Soviet deployment of $S-20 missiles
targeted against NATO territory. It also signalled NATO
resolve to maintain the effectiveness and integrity of its
deterrent capabilities, and helped lay the foundation for
effective arms control negotiations aimed at reducing
the ballistic missile threat to NATO.

In clear contrast to the Soviet Union, it is NATO's
policy to maintain non-strategic nuclear forces at the
lowest level capable of deterring the Warsaw Pact
threat. In pursuance of this policy, the Alliance decided
in October 1983 to reduce the number of warheads in
Europe by 1400, in addition to the 1,000 warhead
reduction completed in 1980. These reductions, taken

 

 

independently of any arms control agreement, will
reduce NATO's nuclear stockpile in Europe to the
lowest level in over 20 years. This makes it essential
that the remaining stockpile be survivable, responsive,
and effective.

Deterrence of Chemical Warfare. While neither NATO
nor the United States seeks to match the Soviets
weapon for weapon, deterrence would be weakened if
the Soviets were allowed to field a capability which
was completely unmatched by a countervailing NATO
capability. This premise, which underlies NATO's
decision to modernize its theater nuclear forces, is
equally relevant to our own determination to
modernize U.S. chemical weapons capability through
development of modern, safe, binary munitions. This
modernization will provide us the capability to deter
Soviet first use of chemical weapons. In the absence of
such capability, we will remain dependent onan aging
stockpile of unitary chemical weapons ill-suited to
modern delivery systems, and alliance nuclear
capabilities, to deter such Soviet use—an obviously
undesirable and risk-prone situation.

The Scope and Intensity of Conflict. Our strategy
recognizes that the Soviet Union, together with allied
forces, is capable of simultaneous aggression in more
than one region of the world. Should aggression occur
in several regions simultaneously, U.S. military
responses would be governed by existing commitments,
general strategic priorities, the specific circumstances at
hand, and the availability of forces. This capability to
respond would be enhanced by the flexibility we have
built into our forces, including our capabilities for
global strategic mobility and power projection. This
capability to respond effectively in distant theaters
reduces the risk that we will ever have to meet such
attacks.

If we must respond to such an attack, our overall
objective would be to terminate the war as soon as
possible, at the lowest level of violence consistent with
the restoration of peace on terms favorable to the
United States and its allies, Should our initial attempts
to defeat aggression fail, however, U.S. strategy provides
for the flexible and sufficient application of force for as
long as combat continues to ensure that no area of
vital interest is lost. Should escalation occur, despite
our best efforts to contain the intensity of the conflict,
we would attempt to employ our forces in a manner
which would discourage further escalation while
achieving our national objectives.

Thus, our strategy recognizes that a variety of factors
would affect the nature, locations, and intensity of our
military actions in a conflict with the Soviet union. Our
strategy is not to try to fight “every where at once.” We
would do what is strategically sensible and
operationally achievable under the circumstances. But
we do need the capability for credible responses to
major threats worldwide, so we can ensure that our
weakness does not tempt our adversaries.

Other U.S. Commitments. NATO is not our only
alliance. The United States has bilateral or multilateral
security Commitments with some 43 nations
throughout the globe.

In support of those commitments, and to deter Soviet
and Soviet client state adventurism, the United States
maintains forward deployed forces in many regions of
strategic importance. In addition to our fleet in the
Mediterranean, the United States maintains a large
naval presence in the Western Pacific. A smaller
presence in the Indian Ocean serves to support our
interests in Southwest Asia. U.S. Air Forces deployed
throughout the Pacific assist in meeting our security
commitments to such nations as Japan and the
Philippines. Substantial ground and air forces are
deployed in Korea to complement forces of the
Republic of Korea in deterring aggression from the
North.

Our global forward deployed forces serve several
functions. They are essential to the creation of regional
power balances which deter Soviet aggression and
promote overall regional stability; they support the
political independence of nations on the Soviet
periphery and hence are key to the fundamental U.S.
strategic objective of avoiding Soviet domination of the
Eurasian land mass; and finally, they provide an
immediately available capability to deal with lesser
military contingencies.

Although the Soviet Union represents the greatest
threat to the United States and its allies, as mentioned
earlier, it is not the only threat. Forward deployed
forces can also discourage local aggression, contribute
to regional stability, and serve as visible symbols of
United States’ will and capability to protect its interests.
For military contingencies not involving the Soviet
Union, however, the United States looks primarily to
the nations involved to provide for their own defense.

27

 

Direct involvement of U.S. military forces is a last
resort, to be undertaken only when clear political
objectives have been established, our political will is
clear, and appropriate military capabilities are available.
If U.S. combat forces are committed, the United States
would seek to limit the scope and level of the conflict,
avoid the involvement of the Soviet Union, and achieve
U.S. objectives as quickly as possible.

In the past six years we have made substantial progress
in improving the capability of our forward deployed
forces to protect U.S. interests, execute our National
Strategy, and support alliance commitments. We remain
firmly committed to continued improvement in our
deployed capabilities in support of our forward-defense,
alliance-based strategy. The following paragraphs will
discuss selected capabilities which provide essential
foundations for that strategy.

Maintenance of Global Support and Mobility
Capabilities. The ability to reinforce and resupply
forward deployed forces is essential to the execution of
the U.S. strategy of forward defense and alliance
solidarity. Rapid reinforcement of NATO during times of
tension, for example, is critical to effective deterrence.

The Soviets have a natural geographic advantage with
respect to countries on the Eurasian rim, and growing
capability to launch simultaneous offensives in Europe,
Southwest Asia and the Far East. Capitalizing on
interior lines of communication, they can redeploy and
resupply forces over a broad geographic range. Recent
Soviet efforts have significantly improved military
access, by rail and road, to strategically important areas
along the USSR’s southern frontiers.

Our global support and mobility capabilities, including
airlift, sealift, and prepositioning are therefore essential
to allow us to meet military challenges around the
periphery of the Eurasian continent, which remains the
primary locus of Soviet expansionist interests.
Prepositioning ashore or at sea can sharply reduce our
response times. Airlift, the quickest and most flexible of
our mobility assets, would deliver initial reinforcements
in most contingencies; but sealift will inevitably carry
the bulk of our reinforcement and resupply material, as
it has in past crises. To reduce response times, the
United States combines prepositioning with airlift and
sealift in an integrated fashion. Mobility capabilities are
especially critical to our strategies for dealing with

28

contingencies in Southwest Asia, where we have no
military bases or permanently stationed military forces.

Consistent with our alliance approach to security, U.S.
allies make critical contributions to the effectiveness of
our mobility capabilities. Not only do our allies
contribute airfield and port facilities, they also augment
our airlift and provide the bulk of our sealift capability.
Finally, allied cooperation is an obvious prerequisite for
prepositioning.

When this decade began, we faced severe difficulties in
moving large forces quickly enough to deter Soviet
aggression, deploying forces to two or more theaters
simultaneously, or moving material effectively into less-
developed regions. Since 1981, with the support of
Congress, we have made great progress in redressing
these deficiencies, adding substantially to our airlift
and sealift capability and prepositioning additional
large quantities of material abroad. Not all of our
objectives have been accomplished, however. In
particular, the continuing decline of the U.S. merchant i
marine and U.S-flag commercial shipping assets is a |
matter of concern. This problem is compounded by the

decline of the U.S-flag fleet which results in a

reduction of the seagoing workforce to man all our

U.S.flag vessels—as well as ships of the Ready Reserve

Force, the National Defense Reserve Fleet and any

effective U.S. controlled ships which might need

recrewing. The lack of merchant mariners in the near

term could impede our ability adequately to project

and sustain forces by strategic sealift.

 

Maintenance of an Adequate Logistics Base. To
maintain a strong conventional deterrent it is vital that
we provide adequate logistic support for U.S. forces. A
robust logistics infrastructure strengthens deterrence by
demonstrating our preparations for hostilities at any
level of intensity, and for the length of time necessary
to defend U.S, interests. Adequate, sustained support
helps raise the nuclear threshold, strengthens
deterrence, and improves prospects for early success in
conflict. Adversaries must not conclude that U.S, and
allied capabilities would erode if confronted with a
complex or prolonged military campaign.

We have made substantial progress over the past six
years in improving our military logistics base, and in

 

the process provided stronger support for our
deterrence strategy. With the support of Congress, we
will seek continued improvement in this unglamorous,
but essential component of military power.
Concurrently, we will continue to emphasize to our
allies the importance of improving the logistics base of
their own forces to ensure that their endurance in
combat will be parallel to that of our forces.

Maintenance of Adequate Active Forces. Support of
our conventional deterrent requires that we maintain
balanced and effective active forces sufficient in quality
and quantity to make our National Military Strategy
credible. In the context of our alliance relationships,
deterring and, if necessary, defeating the Soviet threat
requires a carefully structured mix of U.S. and allied
land and sea-based forces capable of executing the
agreed strategy until reinforced from the respective
countries’ mobilization bases. In the case of NATO, the
proximity of major Warsaw Pact ground, air and naval
forces to Alliance territory, the speed with which
modern conflict can unfold, the Pact’s significant
numerical advantages, and the Soviets’ strong doctrinal
emphasis on surprise, all argue for substantial,
qualitatively advanced, and flexible U.S. and allied
conventional forces.

The land-based forces of the United States and its allies
would have primary responsibility for blunting a Soviet
attack and defending allied territory, while
simultaneously disrupting and destroying the follow-on
forces which Soviet strategy relies on to exploit any
initial successes. U.S, and allied ground forces,
supported by tactical air power, require the capability
to halt a Pact attack and restore the integrity of Alliance
territory if NATO political and military objectives are to
be achieved. Absent such capability, Alliance strategy
becomes heavily dependent on the threat of resorting
to nuclear weapons to achieve essential deterrence and
warfighting objectives.

For decades it has been a fundamental U.S. objective to
reduce the risk of nuclear warfare by maintaining the
nuclear threshold at a high level. Achievement of this
goal requires that, wherever we confront Soviet forces,

. the forces of the United States and its allies have the
capability to achieve their missions with conventional!

arms. In the case of our land-based forces committed to
Europe, this requires constant upgrading and
modernization. to retain a qualitative edge in the face of
the Pact’s superior numbers.

While NATO requirements properly occupy much of
our ground forces’ concern, the global nature of
potential threats to U.S. interests requires maintenance
of flexible and diverse ground forces capable of rapid
deployment to, and effective operations in, areas of
strategic importance. This has led the Army to establish
five rapidly deployable light divisions, while continuing
efforts have gone into the enhancement of Marine
Corps capabilities. These ground forces, with
appropriate tactical air support, provide essential
elements of our capability to deal with worldwide
contingency requirements.

Tactical airpower supports the achievement of ground
force goals by maintaining battlefield air superiority,

providing responsive and effective firepower for Army
maneuver units, and conducting deep interdiction of
enemy forces, command and control capabilities, and

- sources of logistic support. In addition, it plays a

critical role in assuring the essential reinforcement and
resupply of U.S. forward deployed forces by protecting
port facilities, aerial ports of debarkation, and lines of
communication from attack and disruption. The
capability of air forces to deploy rapidly in crises adds
to our ability to deter threats to our interests in distant
areas, and to bring effective military power to bear
should deterrence fail.

Maritime forces play a unique role in supporting our
military strategy. Given the realities of our geostrategic
position, fronting on two oceans, maritime superiority
is vital to support our alliance relationships and our
forward deployed forces. While maritime superiority
depends predominantly on the capabilities of our naval
forces, land-based air forces also contribute to its
maintenance in important ways, including early
warning of enemy air threats, long-range aerial tanker
support for sea-based tactical aircraft, and the laying of
anti-submarine mines.

Maritime superiority enables us to capitalize on Soviet
geographic vulnerabilities and to pose a global threat

29

 

to the Soviets interests. It plays a key role in plans for
the defense of NATO allies on the European flanks. It
also permits the United States to tie down Soviet naval
forces in defensive posture protecting Soviet ballistic
missile submarines and the seaward approaches to the
Soviet homeland, and thereby to minimize the wartime
threat to the reinforcement and resupply of Europe by
sea,

The mobile nature of maritime forces allows them
directly to influence and campaigns through the
application of sea-based tactical air power; and by the
use of amphibious forces to seize strategically
important territory, reinforce allies accessible from the
sea, or threaten the seaward flanks of enemy ground
forces.

This capability to project power far from our shores is
of particular importance, given the central position of
the Soviet Union in the Eurasian land mass, the fact
that many of the United States’ most important allies
are located on the Eurasian periphery and offshore
islands, and the volatility of many Third World areas in
which there is no U.S. military presence. Our naval
power projection capabilities would play an essential
role in any Southwest Asia contingency.

Essential to our wartime strategy, maritime superiority
plays equally vital roles in peacetime. Mobile maritime
forces, easily deployed in time of crisis, are a traditional
symbol of our nation’s wil! and capability to defend its
vital interests. They have proven to be an indispensable
tool of crisis management for every U.S. president since
the end of World War Il. Finally, by permitting the
rapid application of U.S. power, maritime superiority
contributes to regional stability, whether in the Indian
Ocean, Central America, the Middle East, or other
areas of strategic concern.

The trends in the maritime area are generally favorable.
We are steadily building back toward our goal of a 600
ship, 15 carrier battle group Navy. With continued
strong Congressional support, the programs of this
Administration should ensure our essential maritime
superiority for the remainder of this century.

Maintenance of Effective Reserve Forces and National
Mobilization Base. The effective mobilization of
manipower and industrial resources in the event of
conflict would provide essential support for our military
capabilities. With approximately 6 percent of GNP
devoted to defense, our peacetime economy focuses on
the needs of the civilian marketplace, not on the
nation’s defense requirements. We rely on the inherent
size and strength of the U.S. economy as our ultimate
line of defense, tapping into civilian production to a
greater or lesser extent only as the situation may

require.

As a result, we require an ability to surge our industrial
base to produce the additional wartime materiel
needed during conflict. The health of the industrial
base, therefore, has clear military and strategic
significance. Accordingly, the U.S. Government
continues to promote initiatives which support
improvements in industrial productivity and
modernization.

Additionally, through its procurement procedures, the
government seeks to provide incentives for increased
productivity, improved manufacturing technologies, and
to increase U.S. competitiveness in the international
marketplace.

To complement our industrial mobilization programs,
the United States has maintained for over thirty years a
stockpile program to ensure a supply of critical raw
materials to support defense and essential civilian
needs during an emergency. It is important that we
continue to modernize our stockpile program to keep
pace with current requirements, changes in industrial
capacity and new manufacturing and technological
developments. Since fundamental disagreements on
stockpile policies exist with the Congress, we must
renew efforts to resolve our differences and develop
tealistic goals and policies which will produce a
modernized stockpile for the future.

On the manpower side, the Total Force policy
established in the early 1970s places increased
responsibilities on the reserve component of U.S.
forces. Today, fully 50 percent of the combat units for

land warfare are in reserve components. Reserve units

 

perform important missions and support functions on a
daily basis. Their priority for manning, training, and
equipment modernization is not based on their
peacetime status as forces “in reserve” but on the basis
of their direct integration into the nation’s operational
plans and missions. In many cases, the sequence of
deployment in the event of conflict would place reserve
component units side-by-side, and sometimes ahead of
active duty forces.

To maximize the cost effectiveness of the Total Force
policy, we must continue to balance the combat and
support elements of our active and reserve force
structure, their costs, and attendant levels of risk. While
there are specific mission areas in which the role of
reserve components can be expanded, we must
exercise care to avoid making demands on our
personnel that would fundamentally alter the nature of
service in the reserves. Our peacetime operational
tempo, forward deployments, and our general strategy
of deterrence all require a substantial, balanced, and
ready active duty military establishment.

SPACE SUPPORT OF
NATIONAL SECURITY

The United States uses space systems to conduct a
variety of activities that are essential to our national
security, including command, control, and
communications, navigation, environmental
monitoring, warning, surveillance, and treaty
monitoring. Support of these important activities
requires assured U.S, access to space, supported by an
efficient and predictable launch capability. Therefore,
late last year | directed that U.S, national space launch
capability be based on a balanced mix of launchers
consisting of the Space Transportation System and
Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELVs). The elements of
this mix support the mission needs of the national
security, ‘civil government, and commercial sectors of
U.S. space activities.

To support this approach, the Department of Defense
has undertaken an effort to achieve the design and -

procurement of a medium-sized ELV. This will
complement the Shuttle, and existing small and large
ELVs. In addition, selected government satellites will be
designed for dual compatibility with either the Shuttle
or ELVs.

In view of the increasing reliance of U.S. and allied
forces on space-based support, we must be prepared to
protect our space assets against hostile interference.
Accordingly, other facets of the national security space
program include development of concepts and
techniques that allow systems to survive in crisis, and
the development of an anti-satellite capability to deter
threats to U.S. space systems, and to deny an adversary
the use of his space-based resources in war, correcting
a serious asymmetry in U.S. and Soviet space
capabilities. The Soviets introduced their anti-satellite
(ASAT) system over a decade ago. Today it is the world’s
only operational ASAT system. The Congressionally
imposed ban on testing of our developmental ASAT
system against targets in space leaves the Soviets with a
monopoly in ASAT capability and should be removed.

Overall, Soviet space programs are strong and growing.
Their well-publicized manned space programs, their
ambitious space scientific exploration programs, and
their impending heavy-lift space launch capabilities
will pose strong challenges to U.S. space leadership in
the near-term. In addition, these capabilities provide
the base for rapid development and deployment of
military space assets.in crises or war.

An emerging technology that has important security, as
well as civil and commercial applications, is the
National Aerospace Plane. The design of this plane
incorporates advanced air and space flight technologies
to yield an aircraft that can function in both the
atmosphere of earth and the vacuum of space. The first
flight of an experimental aerospace craft, which
capitalizes on important U.S. technological advantages,
could take place by the mid-1990s.

INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT OF
NATIONAL SECURITY

Development and execution of a sound National
Security Strategy requires effective intelligence

 

capabilities to provide thorough and accurate
appreciations of actual or potential threats to our
national security. Early warning of developments which
could place at risk key U.S. interests is vital if we are to
employ the relevant elements of national power in a
timely way, and deal with threats before they become
unmanageable, or entail the risk of major conflict.

Our deterrence strategy relies heavily on reliable
intelligence concerning potential adversaries’ strategies,
forces, doctrine, strengths, weaknesses, and probable
courses of action. Intelligence also provides essential
insights into how we are viewed by those adversaries.
An appreciation of their perceptions of our capabilities,
political will, national interests, and likely reaction to
hostile provocation, provides an important measure of
the effectiveness of our deterrence. Intelligence also
improves our ability to detect violations of arms control
agreements and potential technological breakthroughs
which could adversely affect the strength of our
strategic or conventional deterrents. Intelligence allows
us to plan our strategies and forces to take advantage of
our adversaries’ weaknesses, correct our own, and
capitalize more effectively on areas of relative
advantage.

The ability to conduct covert operations is an essential
adjunct of our intelligence capability, and allows us to
deal effectively with developing threats to our security
before they require the employment of U.S. military
power or other actions entailing higher costs or risks.

The capability to deal with the hostile intelligence
threat to the United States provides equally important
support for our National Security Strategy. The
extremely large and active intelligence services of the
Soviet Union, its clients and surrogates, conduct highly
sophisticated collection and analysis operations
targeted against us, our allies, and friends. The Soviets
rely heavily on espionage, and the illegal acquisition of
Western military technology, to achieve broad strategic
aims and aid materially in shifting the global
“correlation of forces” to Soviet advantage. The
apprehension over the past few years of spies
conducting very damaging espionage operations
against the United States has dramaticaly underlined

32

the severity of the threat. As part of our intelligence
strategy we have taken a number of steps in recent
years to strengthen our security and counter-
intelligence capabilities. These efforts will continue as
a matter of high national priority.

LOW INTENSITY CONFLICT

Conflict in the Third World can pose serious threats to
US. security interests, Low Intensity Conflicts, which
take place at levels below conventional war but above
the routine, peaceful competition among states, can be
particularly troublesome. They often involve a
protracted struggle of competing principles and
ideologies. Low Intensity Conflicts may be waged by a
combination of means, including the use of political,
economic, informational, and military instruments.
They are often localized, but can have significant
regional and global security implications.

Major causes of Low Intensity Conflict are instability
and lack of political and economic development in the
Third World (though Low Intensity Conflict can occur
in areas outside the Third World as well). These
conditions provide fertile ground for unrest and for
groups and nations wishing to exploit unrest for their
own purposes. The resulting conflicts are of concern to
the United States when they assault U.S. national
interests and the security, values, or political
foundations of the United States, our friends, and allies.
Low Intensity Conflict can gradually isolate the United
States, its allies, and major trading partners from the
Third World and from each other. This isolation can be
manifest in economic, political, and military terms.

Specifically, Low Intensity Conflict can lead to:

© Interruption of Western access to vital resources.

* Gradual loss of U.S. military basing and access
rights.

© Expanded threats to key sea lines of communication.

¢ Gradual shifting of allies and trading partners

away from the United States into positions of
accommodation with hostile interests.

© Expanded opportunities for Soviet political and
military gains,

 

An effective U.S. response to this form of warfare
requires the national will to sustain long-term
commitments. The United States has addressed the
manifestations of Low Intensity Conflict through a
tough counter-terrorism policy; support for democratic
resistance movements; and political, economic, and
military assistance to developing nations to help them
prevent or combat low intensity challenges.

US. policy for dealing with Low Intensity Conflict
situations may be summarized as follows: When it is in
US. interest to do so, the United States:

© Will take measures to strengthen friendly nations
facing internal or external threats to their
independence and stability by systematically
employing, in coordination with friends and allies,
the full range of political, economic, informational,
and military instruments of power. Where possible,
action will be taken before instability leads to
violence.

¢ Will work to ameliorate the underlying causes of
instability and conflict in the Third World by
pursuing foreign assistance, trade, and investment
programs that promote economic development and
the growth of democratic social and political orders.

© May support selected resistance movements acting in
opposition to regimes working against U.S. interests.
Such support will be coordinated with friends and
allies and may contain political, informational,
economic, and military elements.

© Will take steps to discourage Soviet and other state-
sponsored adventurism, and increase the costs to
those who use proxies or terrorist and subversive
forces to exploit instability in the Third World.

The Low Intensity Conflict strategies that support these
policies must coordinate the use of a variety of policy
instruments among U.S. Government agencies and
internationally. Responses may draw on economic,
political, and informational tools, as well as military
assistance,

Economic Policy and Low Intensity Conflict. U.S.
policy for Low Intensity Conflict recognizes that long
term political and economic development will reduce
the underlying causes of instability of the Third World,
help undermine the attractiveness of totalitarian
regimes, and eventually lead to conditions favorable to

U.S. and Western interests. Therefore, we will
encourage expansion of free trade, the development of
private enterprise, and the expansion and
independence of local economies. U.S. development
assistance and economic aid programs facilitate these
policies. In addition, we will encourage private
investment in the Third World when that investment
supports balanced economic growth.

Informational Policy and Low Intensity Conflict. Low
Intensity Conflict is a political struggle in which ideas
may be as important as arms. We hold significant
advantages over our adversaries in this area. In contrast
to our adversaries, we have an open political system
that thrives on communication and truth. We must
ensure, however, that accurate information concerning
American ideals and objectives is available throughout
the Third World; and that the resources needed to
accomplish this are available.

Political Instruments and Low Intensity Conflict. We
recognize that other nations may not necessarily
develop along democratic lines identical to ours.
Nevertheless, we seek to encourage the development of
political systems that protect the rights of the individual
and provide for representative government, free
institutions, and an environment in which human
dignity can flourish. We do this partially by example,
and by defending our own ideals when they are
challenged. We can also promote development of
humane social orders by helping eliminate security
threats and the underlying economic causes of unrest
and instability.

Military Instruments in Low Intensity Conflict. The
fundamental tenet of U.S. strategy for dealing with Low
Intensity Conflict directed against our friends and allies
is that military institutions in threatened states must
become able to provide security for their citizens and
governments. U.S. Low Intensity Conflict policy,
therefore, recognizes that indirect—rather than direct—
applications of U.S. military power are the most
appropriate and cost effective ways to achieve national
goals. The principal military instrument in Low
Intensity Conflict, therefore, is security assistance.

The primary role for U.S. armed forces in Low Intensity
Conflict is to support and facilitate the security
assistance program. The military services must also
stand ready to provide more direct forms of military
assistance when called upon. Usually, this assistance

33

 

will consist of technical training and logistical support.
_ The services and the Unified Commands must also be
prepared for the effective execution of contingency and
peacekeeping operations when such operations are
required to protect national interests. U.S. combat
forces will be introduced into Low Intensity Conflict
situations only as a last resort and when vital national
interests cannot otherwise be adequately protected.

Narcotics Trafficking and Low Intensity Conflict.
Narcotics trafficking can breed violence, fuel instability
and threaten governing institutions wherever it is found.
The vast revenues produced by illegal narcotics sales,
and concomitant use of international financial networks
to launder the proceeds of these transactions, can
promote the type of instability that becomes a breeding
ground for Low Intensity Conflict. For these reasons,
our policies for dealing with drug trafficking provide
important support for our efforts to deal with Low
Intensity Conflict.

Terrorism and Low Intensity Conflict. Under some
circumstances, terrorism can be an important aspect of
Low Intensity Conflict. This Administration has taken

significant steps to define and implement policies to
counter international terrorism. These policies focus on
deterring, pre-empting and effectively reacting to
international terrorist incidents. Low Intensity Conflict
policy goes beyond this, however, and deals with the
broader problem of supporting groups and
governments against which terrorism is being used as a
subversive weapon.

We must realize that Low Intensity Conflicts are
frequently protracted struggles. In addition, most of the
instruments of power that we can bring to bear on
them work indirectly and over a long period of time.
Therefore, we must be patient in such struggles. It is
important that we prevail, but especially important that
we recognize that we often cannot do so easily or
quickly. On the other hand, we do hold important
advantages. We represent a model of political and
economic development that promises freedom from
political domination and economic privation. If we can
protect our own security, and maintain an environment
of reasonable stability and open trade and
communication throughout the Third World, political,
economic, and social forces will eventually work to our
advantage.

 

V. Executing the Strategy

This portion of the report discusses U.S. capabilities to
execute the National Security Strategy discussed in
preceding chapters with particular emphasis on those
areas where resource shortfalls impede effective
achievement of important national strategy objectives.

FOREIGN POLICY
CAPABILITIES

The United States depends on foreign assistance and
other foreign operations programs to protect national
security, promote its interests, and communicate its
values and principles throughout the world. Our
foreign operations programs include economic and
military assistance, food aid, development assistance,
international education and communication programs,
the overseas operations of the State Department, and
many other important functions.

These programs convert our foreign policy into positive,
visible actions which provide assistance to people who
face severe economic privation, and promote the
economic and political development so important to
support free and democratic societies. The programs
also help governments seeking to defend themselves
from internal and external threats. By helping our
friends enhance their security, we can help create the
necessary preconditions for economic and political
development.

Equally important, our programs tell people about
American ideals and values. By building greater
understanding of what the United States stands for, we

can influence growth in positive directions. The overall
goal of our efforts is to create a more stable world in
which humane social and political orders can flourish
and which can support balanced economic growth. In
short, our foreign operations programs are intended to
support the types of positive change that will protect
our national interests over the long term. A stable
world whose nations can meet the economic needs of
their citizens and respect individual rights is a world
that is safer for the United States and its friends.

We spend only about two percent of our annual federal
budget on the various foreign assistance programs. This
is indisputably money well spent. The good we do, the
problems we help solve, and the threats we counter
through our assistance programs far outweigh the costs.
They represent a highly leveraged investment.
Nevertheless, our foreign assistance programs do not
receive the support they deserve from the Congress. In
the last few years, Administration foreign operations
budget requests have been severely cut by the
Congress. Although all programs must bear the burden
of reducing the budget deficit, the cuts in foreign
assistance have often been grossly disproportionate
when compared with other programs.

This is penny wise and pound foolish. We cannot
dismiss foreign assistance as a “give-away” program that
wastes money which could better be spent on
Americans. In the first place, such a characterization is
factually wrong. Much of the money we spend in
foreign assistance programs goes to purchase goods
and services produced here in the United States. Our
food aid programs are one of the best examples, but
other programs, such as foreign military sales, also
directly increase U.S. exports.

 

Furthermore, our assistance programs work to solve
problems, relieve hardships, and ameliorate conflicts
that, if neglected, could degenerate into crises
adversely affecting U.S. interests. Unless we can be an
active participant in encouraging the type of world
order we desire, we may find ourselves compelled to
defend our interests with more direct, costly, and
painful means.

We face a foreign assistance funding crisis under the
FY1987 budget voted by Congress. In that budget, we
sought $16.2 billion for Foreign Economic and Military
Assistance. That assistance was carefully calculated to
support a broad variety of important U.S. national
security objectives,

Specifically:

© Thirty-four percent of that budget was to go to Israel
and Egypt, reinforcing our vital search for lasting
peace in that region.

© Twenty-six percent was intended for military access
states and countries hosting U.S. military forces such
as the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, Greece
and Turkey.

© Eleven percent would have gone to Central America
and the Caribbean.

* Seventeen percent was for countries which share our
democratic values and need our help to advance
them, such as Thailand and Colombia; where new
democracies have emerged, such as Bolivia and
Uruguay; and where fundamental economic reforms
are taking place, such as Ecuador and Senegal.

¢ All other country programs accounted for only three
percent of the total foreign aid request. Some are
poverty-stricken African states to which we are
directing our humanitarian and technical assistance
programs. Others, such as Burma, are active partners
with us in the war against international narcotics
trafficking.

© The remaining nine percent of our assistance was to
go to international organizations, multilateral
development banks, the Peace Corps, refugee
assistance, narcotics control efforts, and AID non-
country programs,

36

Congress cut our request to $13.6 billion. The effect of
this cut is devastating. After we meet our commitment
to the Middle East peace process, we have grossly
inadequate funds left to meet other requirements. As a
result, we are unable to fulfill our commitments to
countries that provide us with strategically important
basing and access rights. Indeed, some programs will
have to be cut over 50 percent this year. We face the
danger of falling behind in programs that are designed
to help key regions beset with severe economic and
security problems. We also can do little to help Third
World debtors get back on their feet.

The cuts signal a policy of retreat. Clearly, in the next
few months the Congress and the Executive Branch
must work together to find solutions to these funding
problems so that we can resume our positive role.
These programs are a key part of our first line of
defense in protecting American freedoms, and must
enjoy full bipartisan support to be effective. | solicit
such support for the FY 1987 supplemental
appropriations request which has been submitted to
Congress.

DEFENSE CAPABILITIES

Defense resources. The successful execution of any
National Security Strategy depends on the availability
of adequate resources. Strategies which depend on
unrealistic or unachievable assumptions about resource
availability are doomed to failure. At the same time,
recent history has taught us that the time between the
onset of a crisis and the need for a national security
response has dwindled over the years. The days when
nations could respond to crises by raising, training, and
equipping new forces are gone. This fact of life,
coupled with the sober knowledge that crisis situations
can burst upon the world with startling suddenness,
means that we must be able to deter aggression and
infringement of our vital interests at any moment, and
at places far removed from the United States.

In practical terms, this means that the Administration
must not adopt strategies that our country cannot afford,

 

and that our military leaders cannot and must not base
their plans on resources that are beyond the nation’s
capability to provide. It also means that Congress,
operating from a shared view of U.S. national interests,
and the objectives which support them, must provide
the Executive with the resources necessary to
implement a realistic, prudent and effective strategy.

Providing for the common defense is the most
important responsibility of the federal government—
shared equally by the Executive and Legislative
branches. Partnership is the key to its successful
execution. In that spirit, in the early 1980's—for the
third time since World War ll—Congress and the
Executive joined together in a concerted effort to
rebuild and strengthen our military capabilities.
However, unlike past build-ups, which were
characterized by high rates of consumption to support
combat operations in Asian conflicts, we focused this
time on investment. There were important manpower
and readiness problems to be overcome as well, but it
was clear that only an increase in investment would
produce the necessary positive, sustained impact on
the military balance.

This action was essential to redress the serious
imbalances between U.S. and Soviet capabilities which
had emerged during the 1970’s—a period of
unprecedented military investment by the Soviets,
aimed at shifting the global “correlation of forces”
decisively in their favor. Had we not arrested this
dangerous trend, the damage to our most fundamental
national interests would have been profound.
Fortunately, the Congress and the American people
recognized the essentiality of rebuilding the country's
defenses. As a result, we have achieved great progress.
Our level of investment roughly matches that of the
Soviets. However, the legacy of a decade in which
Soviet investment far exceeded our own remains, and
must be corrected.

Judgments about the adequacy of our defense program
ultimately come down to questions of risk. Put in its
starkest form, the issue is: how much risk to the
survival of this country and its free institutions are we
willing to accept? Military forces which are
unsuccessful in deterring major war fail the first test of

adequacy. We and our allies must have credible
military responses, the prospects of which convince our
adversaries that aggression would entail unacceptably
high costs for them. How much military power is
required to deter is inevitably a subjective question,
involving our sense of how others view our military
capabilities and our political will to use them, if
necessary. In this respect, our forces must not only be
adequate, but must be unmistakably perceived as
adequate to defend our interests, execute our strategy,
and preserve our alliance relationships.

Without question, the defense program required to
support our strategy is affordable. In fact, in the past
seven years, Americans have devoted an average of only
6.1 percent of GNP to defense—well under rates in the
1950s and 1960s, which ranged from 7 percent to 9.2
percent. Likewise, at about 27 percent of federal
outlays, defense spending falls well below the
peacetime average of 38 percent during the postwar
era. In both instances, the increases of the early 1980s
seem large only because the spending of the late 1970s
was so severely depressed.

In the FY88-89 Defense Budget, ! have not asked the
Congress to approve defense increases similar to those
of the early 1980s. At the same time, the Congress must
act positively to protect the gains that we together have
achieved. We must not continue on the path of real
decline in defense investment established during the
past two years. The time has come for us to join
together in supporting moderate, sustainable increases
in our defense budget, consistent with the economic
growth we expect for the nation as a whole, and with
the long-term challenge which the Soviet Union
presents to the free world. Together, as a nation, we
must break the pattern of costly and inefficient ups and
downs in defense spending, and support the path of
sustained, reasonable growth, at a rate which will
allow the continuing modernization of our strategic
and conventional forces, while maintaining adequate
levels of military readiness, sustainability, and force
structure.

Military Forces. Earlier in this report | set forth our
strategy for the maintenance of deterrence against
strategic nuclear or conventional attack on the United
States or its allies.

37

 

The execution of our strategy to maintain a credible
nuclear deterrent through the modernization of our
strategic forces has been successful to date. Major
elements of the Strategic Modernization Program have
been approved by the Congress and out strategic forces
are becoming more survivable and effective each day.
We are improving the capability and credibility of our
diversified strategic force mix and will continue to do
so well into the next century.

As we look forward to the future, we are examining
options that will allow us to capitalize on the progress
made in the Strategic Defense Initiative to render
ballistic missiles obsolete and place deterrence on a
more stable long-term foundation. Strong support for
this program, which exploits our strengths in advanced
technology, advances both our deterrence and our
arms control goals. Full funding of the FY88-89 budget
request for SDI is essential to sustain the important
progress made to date and allow the program to
proceed at an efficient pace.

The survivability of our land-based ICBM forces will
increase dramatically in the years ahead.as we move
from older, fixed basing modes to new mobile basing
modes that contribute to stability through increased
survivability. The new concepts for mobile basing of
the Peacekeeper and the Small ICBM will revitalize the
ICBM leg of the strategic triad, significantly improve
deterrence, and allow implementation of the Scowcroft
Commission recommendations in a manner consistent
with earlier Congressional guidance.

As we continue to improve our strategic deterrent
forces, we must be mindful of the fact that our
conventional forces are the first line of deterrence, and
an essential means of supporting U.S. interests in crises
short of general war. With the emergence of rough
nuclear parity between the United States and the Soviet
Union, conventional forces have become even more
important to maintaining a secure deterrent. Our
current conventional force modernization program
contributes to a strong forward defense posture.

Key elements include:

® The Army's modernization program, which is based
on the new Air Land Battle doctrine, and provides a

38

combined-arms capability that will enable our
divisions to maintain a qualitative edge over the
much larger Soviet forces.

© Ongoing modernization programs for our tactical air
forces supplement these ground force programs. The
ability of our tactical air forces to maintain local air
superiority and support ground forces requires
continuing improvement.

© The program to revitalize our special operations
forces is being fully implemented as one of our
highest priorities. This program will ensure that we
have highly trained forces immediately available to
respond to a broad range of crises and Low Intensity
Conflict situations, when our interests so require.

¢ Improvements in C’l are of continuing high priority
in order to strengthen the ability to employ our
conventional forces to their full capability.

@ New short and long range mobility forces are
improving our capability to transport and support
our forward units, and to deploy forces in
contingencies. The ability to build up military power
rapidly in strategically important areas on the
Eurasian periphery is essential for deterrence, and for
neutralizing the geographical advantages of the
Soviet Union.

© The warfighting capability of our naval forces is
improving markedly with the increase in the quantity
and quality of ships and aircraft. This long-term
program to assure our ability to use the world’s
oceans in peace and war requires continuing
support.

The full impact of these major modernization programs
will be felt over the decade ahead. Accomplishment of
our objectives will greatly increase our conventional
deterrent capability. The net improvement in our
defense posture will not be marginal; it will be
fundamental. Full support of these programs is
essential to avoid deterioration of the U.S.Soviet
conventional force balance, and assure that we have
conventional forces capable of conducting forward
defense of our interests without recourse to nuclear
weapons.

 

As we pursue the qualitative upgrading of our forces,
we must continue to refine our plans and concepts for
employing them. Our military strategy is complex. To
accomplish their tasks the Services have developed
appropriate doctrines, organizations and tactics.
Ensuring that these are melded into a coherent
National Military Strategy presents a challenge in the
continuously changing international environment. This
problem is magnified by the diversity of potential
contingencies within the spectrum of conventional
conflict. At the theater level, regional strategies have
been developed by the Unified Commanders. These
strategies, together with other considerations global in
character, or which cross CINCS’ lines of authority, are
integrated into the National Military Strategy. That
strategy provides an effective basis for the employment
of our military capabilities worldwide, in a
coordinated, mutually supporting fashion. That strategy
undergoes periodic reviews to revalidate and update its
essential elements. The results will not only improve
our capability for employment of military forces, but
provide stronger conceptual support for development of
our conventional force R & D and procurement
programs. In doing so, we are always mindful of the
relationship between nuclear and conventional
deterrence. Our long-term objective of reducing our
reliance on nuclear weapons, if successful, demands
special attention to maintaining both the effectiveness
of our conventional deterrent and strong alliance
relationships.

Improving Efficiency. An important part of the activity
aimed at supporting our National Security Strategy
includes a series of ongoing efforts to improve the
management and operational effectiveness of our
defense establishment. Improving the efficiency of the
Department of Defense has been the subject of much
attention and a number of notable achievements over
the past six years. Most recently these efforts have
included the report of the Blue Ribbon Commission on
Defense Management, chaired by David Packard; and
Congressional action on defense reorganization. As a
result of this activity, important changes have been
accomplished in the way the Department of Defense
does business. The overriding objectives of these
combined efforts are to improve the quality of our
strategic planning; promote a tight linkage between

strategy, military requirements, and our acquisition
programs; and ensure that we realize maximum
military benefit for every defense dollar.

Important organizational changes have occurred; others
are impending. New Unified Commands for
Transportation and Special Operations Forces will
become operational this year, and we will shortly
establish the newly authorized position of Assistant
Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low
Intensity Conflict, concurrently activating the
Congressionally-mandated Board for Low Intensity
Conflict within the National Security Council
organization. The authority of the Chairman, Joint
Chiefs of Staff, and the Unified Commanders, has been
strengthened; and the new position of Vice Chairman,
Joint Chiefs of Staff, has been established.

In 1986, the Congress approved my proposal to create
an Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition. This
appointment has led to a reorganization of
procurement functions within the Department of
Defense. These changes are intended to achieve a
major reduction in the time required to field new
technology and equipment, to involve the professional
judgment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff more directly in
the identification and validation of military
requirements, and to improve the efficiency of the
acquisition process generally. To promote technological
innovation, the role of the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency in prototyping and other advanced
development work on joint programs has been
expanded.

To aid our understanding of future requirements, last
fall we established a bipartisan Commission on
Integrated Long-Term Strategy. This group of
distinguished Americans is working to provide the
Secretary of Defense and my Assistant for National
Security Affairs insights into the role and strategic
implications of new defense technologies over the next
twenty years. The Commission will also look at ways to
accelerate the introduction of the most promising new
technologies into our military forces. Possible new
threats resulting from ongoing Soviet research programs
will also be examined.

Changes underway in the defense planning process will
strengthen the relationship between the fiscal plans for
defense and the overall budgetary plans for the federal

39

 

government. With the encouragement of Congress, we
are for the first time submitting a two-year defense
budget. In both instances, the objective is greater
stability for the defense program. While we will
continue to strive for greater cost control and savings, at
the program level, the Blue Ribbon Commission on -
Defense Management concluded that, in the future, ”
significant efficiencies in the defense budget were more
likely to be achieved through greater program stability
than through specific management actions.

Greater stability can be effectively accomplished only
through close cooperation between the Executive
Branch and the Congress. Our joint interest in
improving defense management has produced a series
of interconnected organizational and procurement
reforms that are now underway. We must now let the
Department of Defense implement these reforms and
assess their effectiveness without undue interference, It
is likely that some adjustments will be required. After
suitable experience with the new structure and
procedures, we will make appropriate
recommendations to the Congress.

INTEGRATING NATIONAL
SECURITY CAPABILITIES

As | indicated earlier, the effective achievement of our
National Security Strategy’s objectives requires the
carefully integrated employment of all facets of national
power. To the maximum extent possible, we attempt to
achieve our objectives through employment of the non-
coercive elements of national power. This approach is
aided when we are able to identify problems early,
diagnose them thoroughly, and apply the pooled
insights and wisdom of my senior advisors to their
solution. The principal vehicle through which this
essential integrating function is

accomplished is the National Security Council (NSC),
and the various interagency groups which function
under its supervision.

The NSC helps us apply our broad objectives to
specific situations and translate those objectives into
detailed policies and strategies. The overreaching task
of the NSC is to help ensure that my decisions are
made in a timely manner, and with benefit of the
clearest possible articulation of alternative courses of
action, their relative strengths and weaknesses, and
likely consequences.

The results of this process are formally recorded as
National Security Decision Directives (NSDDs). The
NSDDs, in the aggregate, provide a broad body of
guidance for the preparation of foreign and defense
policy, military planning, and the development of sub-
strategies to support the National Security Strategy’s
objectives. Over the past six years we have developed
over two hundred and fifty NSDDs. Not all remain in
force, and not all deal with topics of global import; but
the process is effective in promoting the integrated
employment of the broad and diverse range of tools
available for achieving our national security objectives.

The continued development and successful
implementation of U.S. National Security Strategy is a
major responsibility of the Executive Branch. But the
Administration cannot accomplish this alone.
Developing and supporting a National Security Strategy
for the United States that provides a sound vision for
the future and a realistic guide to action must be a
cooperative endeavor of the Congress and the
Administration.

| look forward to working with the Congress in a
bipartisan manner to achieve increased understanding
of, and broad support for, our National Security
Strategy and its objectives. There can be no endeavor
more important for the long-term well-being of the
American people; and | solicit the Congress’ closest
collaboration in achieving it.

 

 

VI. Looking Forward to the 1990's

Six years ago, when the American people elected me
as their President, | was determined to achieve four
near-term, urgently needed objectives in the National
Security Strategy area:

© First, to restore our nation’s military strength after a
decade of neglect which allowed the Soviet Union
to overtake us in many critical categories of military

power,
¢ Second, to restore our nation’s economic strength

and reinvigorate the world economic system, in the
wake of the energy crisis and global recession;

© Third, to restore the nation’s international prestige as
a world leader, after some years of our image being
tarnished and our adversaries believing that the
United States was retreating from its international
obligations; and

¢ Fourth, to restore personal motivation to all
Americans and carry our message to the world that
individuals and not governments should control
their economic, spiritual and political destinies.

After six years, | can report this restoration process is
well underway. The ship of state is heading in a new,
long-term direction which should be pursued over the
remaining years of this century. | believe that our most
important thrust in the National Security Strategy area
has been to restore the image of the United States as
the light of freedom throughout the world.

We have seen our message taken to heart by peoples
and governments throughout the world in these last six
years. We have seen nations change their economic
thinking to place more emphasis on the worth and
work of the individual as opposed to satisfying the
interests of the state. We have seen thousands of

freedom loving people take up arms against those
regimes which seek to impose their will on
populations who want peace and economic stability.
We have seen mounting opposition to those forces in
the world that aggressively employ military power and
coercion to achieve their goals.

This is what has given me the personal strength to
forge ahead in times of trouble and criticism, in times
of great risk and potential loss. | have seen that time is
on our side against those forces in this world that are
committed to the elimination of freedom, justice, and
democratic ways of life. Time is running out for those
regimes because people everywhere realize that the
way of life imposed by those forces is counter to basic
human values. People across the world see that we
offer a vision of the future. Our adversaries offer the
darkened ways of an unsatisfied past through
domination by military power, stifling statism, and
political oppression.

| have used every opportunity these past six years to
drive this theme home, both here and abroad. This is
also the dominant theme of our National Security
Strategy—the very pulse of our nation which must be
carried into the future to ensure that we remain strong
and innovative, vibrant and free.

We must never forget that freedom is never really free;
it is the most costly thing in the world. And freedom is
never paid for in a lump sum; installments come due in
every generation. All any of us can do is offer the
generations that follow a chance for freedom.

I ask that we stand together in my final two years as
your President to ensure that we continue setting in
place a strategy which will carry us securely into the
21st Century.

Preface

This statement of America’s National Security Strategy
builds on my initial report to the Congress and the
American people last year. In the twelve months since,
the strategy outlined in that first report has served the
nation well in protecting our interests and advancing
our security objectives around the world.

In last year’s report | noted that, at the outset of this
Administration, | had set forth four broad objectives
that underpinned our National Security Strategy. They
were:

® First, to restore our nation’s military strength after a
period of decline in which the Soviet Union
overtook us in many critical categories of military
power;

e Second, to restore our nation’s economic strength
and reinvigorate the world economic system;

* Third, to restore the nation’s international prestige
as a world leader; and

* Fourth, to restore pride among all Americans and
carry our message to the world that individuals and
not governments should control their economic,
spiritual and political destinies.

Our National! Security Strategy continues to be aimed
at reinforcing the gains we have achieved in each of
these areas, while employing all the elements of our
national power—political, economic and military—in a
coordinated way to advance the full range of national
security interests outlined elsewhere in this report.

The fundamentals of our strategy change little from
year to year; our interests and objectives are derived
from enduring values. Much of the discussion in this

 

report therefore parallels that of last year, with changes
as necessary to reflect significant developments in the
interim. These include:

© Our persistence and adherence to principle have
borne fruit in the historic agreement to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF)—the first of
the nuclear era to achieve meaningful reductions in
U.S. and Soviet arsenals. This treaty is a victory for
the Atlantic Alliance as well, reflecting the firmness
that all allies showed. We have also made further
progress toward a START agreement that could cut
U.S. and Soviet strategic offensive arms by 50
percent.

¢ Our SDI program is making great progress, moving
us toward the prospect of a safer world—one which
depends for its security on strategic defense, rather
than on the threat of mutual nuclear retaliation.

* In the Persian Gulf we have augmented our
traditional military presence to prevent Iran from
interfering with U.S-flag shipping and to support
our diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the tragic
Iran-Iraq war. Our allies’ contributions to the safe
navigation of the Gulf by non-belligerent shipping
are welcomed, and underline the importance which
the Free World ascribes to this strategically and
economically pivotal region of the world.

* Critical imbalances remain in the international
economy which could portend problems ahead
unless they are addressed in a forthright and
effective manner by the governments of the
industrialized nations. The major world economies,
including our own, are sound and can provide the
basis for continued growth and prosperity, provided
we and our partners deal with important fiscal,

 

trade and budgetary issues in sensible and
cooperative ways.

In the Soviet Union we hear talk of “new thinking”
and of basic changes in Soviet policies at home
and abroad. We will welcome real changes, but we
have yet to see any slackening of the growth of
Soviet military power, or abandonment of expan-
sionist aspirations. As we work to find areas for fur-
ther cooperation, we will continue to judge the
Soviets by their actions, rather than their words, and
to found our National Security Strategy on a
realistic view of Soviet aims and capabilities.

On many continents, efforts by the Soviet Union
and its clients to impose or maintain Leninist
regimes by force of arms are meeting increasing
resistance. In Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Angola, and
Cambodia, anti-Communist insurgencies are raising
the cost of aggression and offering hope of just
political solutions. Our strong support for Freedom
Fighters, from Afghanistan to Nicaragua, is a vital
insurance policy for peace with freedom. We are
encouraging the broader democratic trend in the
world—from Latin America to the Philippines, to the
Republic of Korea.

 

 

* At home, however, the reluctance on the part of the
Congress to provide the financial resources
necessary to support our National Security Strategy
is a cause for rising concern. Our assessment of
risks to important U.S. interests has increased, and
some of the recent gains in redressing the military
and geopolitical balance are in jeopardy. The im-
plications of this adverse trend, now in its third
year, are discussed in more detail in the final
chapter of this report.

| forward this report with the confidence that it will
help the Congress and the American people better
understand our National Security Strategy and con-
tribute to the consensus needed to enable us to fulfill
our responsibilities as leader of the world’s
democracies.

As | said in last year’s report, we must never forget
that freedom is never really free; it is the most costly
thing in the world. And freedom is never paid for in a
lump sum. Installments come due in every generation.
All any of us can do is offer the generations that
follow a chance for freedom. In the final analysis, this
is the assurance that our National Security Strategy
seeks to provide. | commend its reading to all
Americans.

I. Historical Dimensions of
U.S. National Security Strategy

This is my second report to the Congress on our
National Security Strategy. Its focus is on how the
principal elements of national power—diplomatic and
informational, economic and military—can be
employed to support our national interests and pro-
mote the objectives of peace, security, and freedom. It
analyzes the major political, economic, and military
threats to our interests, and discusses the strategies
that we believe most appropriate to respond to those
threats and to help shape the future in accordance
with our positive goals and ideals. It also discusses
some of the dilemmas, tradeoffs and risks that
America faces, because we realize that our knowledge
of our adversaries is never certain and that all
resources, including our national! will, are finite.

Walter Lippmann once wrote:

. the behavior of nations over a long period of
time is the most reliable, though not the only index
of their national interests. For though their interests
are not eternal, they are remarkably persis-
tent. . . There is no great mystery why this should
be: the facts of geography are permanent . . . thus
successive generations of men tend to face the same
recurrent problems and to react to them in more or
less habitual ways.

Lippmann’s observation is particularly apt. While it is
commonplace to hear that U.S. National Security
Strategy changes erratically every four to eight years as
a result of a new Administration taking office, in reali-
ty there is a remarkable consistency over time when
our policies are viewed in historical perspective. The
core interests and objectives of this Nation have
changed little since World War II.

The first historical dimension of our strategy is
relatively simple, clear-cut, and immensely sensible. It

 

 

is the conviction that the United States’ most basic na-
tional security interests would be endangered if a
hostile state or group of states were to dominate the
Eurasian landmass—that area of the globe often re-
ferred to as the world’s heartland. We fought two
world wars to prevent this from occurring. And, since
1945, we have sought to prevent the Soviet Union
from capitalizing on its geostrategic advantage to
dominate its neighbors in Western Europe, Asia, and
the Middle East, and thereby fundamentally alter the
global balance of power to our disadvantage.

The national strategy to achieve this objective has
been containment, in the broadest sense of that term.
Administrations have differed over which instruments
of national power—diplomatic and informational,
economic or military—should receive the most atten-
tion at any particular time. But, in the final analysis,
every Administration since World War || has endorsed
the concept that the United States, in partnership with
its allies, must prevent the Soviet Union from domi-
nating those great concentrations of industrial power
and human capacity that are Western Europe and East
Asia. Thus, shortly after World War II, the United
States helped rebuild, through the Marshal! Plan, the
war-ravaged economies of Europe, limiting Soviet op-
portunities to exploit Europe’s economic distress. In
addition, America deployed military forces forward, as
necessary, to help deter and contain Soviet military
expansion. As Soviet capabilities grew, our security
also required a large strategic nuclear force to aug-
ment the forward-deployed conventional deterrent and
to reinforce our deterrence of both nuclear and con-
ventional attacks on ourselves or our allies.

The advent of nuclear weapons and intercontinental
delivery systems added another dimension to our
thinking about National Security Strategy: these

weapons became the primary threat to our national
survival. Thus, for over forty years, the deterrence of
nuclear war and the reduction of its threat have been
major objectives of U.S. National Security Strategy. We
have pursued these objectives with renewed vigor, and
heartening results, during this Administration.

Similarly, the economic element of our national power
has long been an important component of our Na-
tional Security Strategy. This Administration’s strong
support for an open and expanding world economy
and trading system reflects a fundamental national in-
terest. The industrial democracies have long been im-
portant trading nations. An open world of enterprise
and the free movement of people, goods, and ideas
are not only the keys to our prosperity, but basic
moral principles. We see an expanding global pros-
perity as enhancing our own. The global economy is
clearly even more interdependent now than early in
this century when America first endorsed these prin-
ciples; and our need for access to markets and raw
materials has increased. As a result, our commitment
to free and fair trade among nations is greater today
than ever.

The facts of geography, as Lippmann pointed out,
dictate basic dimensions of our National Security
Strategy. Since the early 19th century we have not
feared invasion of the American mainland; and even
to this day, our national territory remains relatively
secure against conventional attack, protected by
oceans on the east and west and friendly nations to
our immediate north and south. However, nuclear
weapons and the means to deliver those weapons over
great distances can now threaten our national survival.
And most of our friends and allies—as well as the
markets and resources that are integrated with our
economy~—are physically distant from the continental
United States.

To help protect our friends and allies, and other U.S.
interests abroad, we must not only possess national
strength, but we must be able to project this power—
diplomatic and informational, economic, and
military—across great sea and air distances. In the
military sphere, we must maintain the capability to
secure our worldwide lines of communication; to pro-
ject military power quickly; to sustain forces at great
distances for extended periods of time; and to pose a
credible deterrent to those who might contemplate
aggression against our allies and friends.

2

 

The United States has long recognized that, even as
we have taken up a major role of world leadership,
our interests and political values call for a deepening
partnership with like-minded nations to advance the
cause of peace and freedom. Thus, an abiding com-
mitment to strong alliances has been a consistent and
vital component of American strategy since the Se-
cond World War. Even if we could afford, economi-
cally and militarily, to chart our National Security
Strategy without allies—which we cannot—we would
not want to do so. “Fortress America’ is an obsolete
concept. Such a policy would be dangerously mis-
guided and self-defeating. Solidarity with our allies
multiplies the strength of all. It permits a sharing of
responsibilities and it reminds us that the cause of
democracies is, after all, one of our most fundamental
goals.

As with all Administrations, during our stewardship we
have faced unique security challenges—and oppor-
tunities— presented by a dynamic world and America’s
own needs. This has given our National Security
Strategy two additional emphases worth noting. The
first is realism. We have sought to deal with the world
as it is, not as we might wish it to be. A strategy
without illusions, based on observable facts, has been
our goal. We attempt to deal with both friends and
adversaries on a basis that recognizes that acts are
more important than words, and that frankness is the
foundation of productive and enduring relationships
among nations. At the same time, we have emphasiz-
ed our willingness to dialogue—to engage our adver-
saries, in particular, in negotiations aimed at finding
areas of common interest, reducing sources of tension,
and rendering our relations more stable and predic-
table. By emphasizing realism and a willingness to
talk, we have been able to place our arms reduction
negotiations with the Soviets on a more solid basis,
culminating in the first agreement between the super-
powers to achieve significant reductions in nuclear
arsenals.

This list of historical dimensions of U.S. National
Security Strategy could be extended, Academics and
practitioners have debated the issue for years. But the
fundamental point should be clear: there has been im-
pressive continuity in U.S. National Security Strategy,
reflecting the fact that the strategy is grounded in un-
changing geographic considerations, and designed to
preserve the fundamental values of our democracy.

Il. Fundamentals of U.S. National

Security Strategy

THE FRAMEWORK—VALUES,
INTERESTS, AND NATIONAL
SECURITY OBJECTIVES

Traditionally national security has been viewed as pro-
tection from external attack, thought of largely in
terms of military defenses against military threats. But
that is clearly too narrow a conception. A nation’s
security today involves much more than the procure-
ment and application of military forces.

National Security Strategy must start with the values
that we as a nation prize. Last year, in observing the
200th anniversary of our Constitution, we celebrated
these values with a sense of rededication—values such
as human dignity, personal freedom, individual rights,
the pursuit of happiness, peace and prosperity. These
are the values that lead us to seek an international
order that encourages self-determination, democratic
institutions, economic development, and human rights.
The ultimate purpose of our National Security Strategy
is to protect and advance those values. But, if they are
to serve as the basis of a National Security Strategy,
these values must be translated into the more concrete
terms of national interests and objectives.

U.S. Interests

Our National Security Strategy reflects our national in-
terests and presents a broad plan for achieving the na-
tional objectives that support those interests. The key
national interests which our strategy seeks to assure
and protect include:

 

 

1. The survival of the United States as a free and in-
dependent nation, with its fundamental values intact
and its institutions and people secure.

2. A healthy and growing U.S. economy to provide
opportunity for individual prosperity and a resource
base for our national endeavors.

3. A stable and secure world, free of major threats to
US. interests.

4. The growth of human freedom, democratic institu-
tions, and free market economies throughout the
world, linked by a fair and open international trading
system.

5. Healthy and vigorous alliance relationships.

Major Objectives
in Support of
U.S. Interests

U.S. national security objectives are broad goals
refined from our national interests. They provide a
general guide for strategy in specific situations which
call for the coordinated use of national power. Our
principal national security objectives are:

1. To maintain the security of our nation and our
allies. The United States, in cooperation with its allies,
must seek to deter any aggression that could threaten
that security and, should deterrence fail, must be
prepared to repel or defeat any military attack and
end the conflict on terms favorable to the United
States, its interests, and its allies.

 

Specifically:

© To deter hostile attack on the United States, its
citizens, military forces, or allies and to defeat
attack if deterrence fails.

© To deal effectively with threats to the security of the
United States and its citizens short of armed con-
flict, including the threat of international terrorism.

© To prevent the domination of the Eurasian landmass
by the Soviet Union, or any other hostile power or
coalition of powers.

* To prevent transfer of militarily critical technologies
and resources to the Soviet bloc and hostile coun-
tries or groups.

© To reduce our reliance on nuclear weapons by
strengthening our conventional forces, pursuing
equitable and verifiable arms control agreements
and developing technologies for strategic defense.

© To assure unimpeded U.S. access to the oceans and
space.

© To foster closer relations with the People’s Republic
of China.

® To prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.

2. To respond to the challenges of the global eco-
nomy. Our national security and economic strength
are indivisible. As the global economy evolves in in-
creasingly interdependent ways, we must be aware of
economic factors that may affect our national security,
now or in the future. Since our dependence on for-
eign sources of supply has grown in many critical
areas, the potential vulnerability of our supply lines is
a matter of concern. Additionally, the threat of a
global spiral of protectionism must be combatted, and
the problem of debt in the developing world is a
burden on international prosperity.

Specifically:

© To promote a strong, prosperous and competitive
U.S. economy, in the context of a stable and grow-
ing world economy.

* To ensure access to foreign markets, energy, and
mineral resources by the United States and its allies
and friends.

¢ To promote a well-functioning international eco-
nomic system with minimal distortions to trade and
investment, with stable currencies, and broadly
agreed and respected rules for managing and
resolving differences.

 

3. To defend and advance the cause of democracy,
freedom, and human rights throughout the world. To
ignore the fate of millions around the world who seek
freedom betrays our national heritage and over time
would endanger our own freedom and that of our
allies.

Specifically:

© To promote national independence and the growth
of free institutions worldwide.

* To encourage and support aid, trade, and invest-
ment programs that promote economic develop-
ment and the growth of free and humane social
and political orders in the Third World.

* To encourage liberalizing tendencies within the
Soviet Union and its client states.

4. To resolve peacefully disputes which affect U.S. in-
terests in troubled regions of the world, Regional con-
flicts which involve allies or friends of the United
States may threaten U.S. interests, and frequently pose
the risk of escalation to wider conflagration. Conflicts,
or attempts to subvert friendly governments, which are
instigated or supported by the Soviets and their client
states, represent a particularly serious threat to the in-
ternational system and thereby to U.S. interests.

Specifically:

© To address, where possible, the root causes of
regional instabilities which create the risk of war.

© To maintain stable regional military balances
vis-a-vis the Soviet Union and states aligned with it.

© To neutralize the efforts of the Soviet Union to in-
crease its influence in the world, and to weaken the
links between the Soviets and their client states in
the Third World.

* To aid in combatting threats to the stability of
friendly governments and institutions from insurgen-
cies, subversion, state-sponsored terrorism and the
international trafficking of illicit drugs.

5. To build effective and friendly relationships with all
nations with whom there is a basis of shared concern.
In the world today, there are over 150 nations. Not
one of them is the equal of the United States in total
power or wealth, but each is sovereign, and most, if
not all, touch U.S. interests directly or indirectly.

Specifically:

¢ To make major international institutions more effec-
tive in promoting peace, world order and political,
economic and social progress.

* To seek opportunities to improve relations with the
Soviet Union on a realistic and reciprocal basis.

© To improve relations with other nations hostile to us
in order to reduce the chance of future conflict.

© To strengthen U.S. influence throughout the world.

PRINCIPAL THREATS TO U.S.
INTERESTS

The most significant threat to U.S. security interests re-
mains the global challenge posed by the Soviet
Union. Despite reforms that the leadership of the So-
viet Union has recently undertaken—the significance
and durability of which remain unclear—Soviet mili-
tary power and active diplomacy continue forcefully to
challenge our vital interests in many parts of the
world. The Soviet Union places a high priority on
creating and exploiting divisions within and among
the Western allies, In key developing countries it sup-
ports communist parties, insurgent movements, and
other elements that seek to undermine governments
allied with or friendly to the United States and to re-
place them with authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.
In other developing countries, modernizing forces
struggling to create or consolidate democratic and free
market societies are actively opposed by groups sup-
ported or inspired by the Soviet Union and its allies.

As a result of changes in leadership style, the Soviet
Union has succeeded in projecting a more favorable
international image. Proposed domestic reforms and
foreign policy initiatives have given rise, in some
cases, to hopes for fundamental changes in Soviet
behavior. The new style of Soviet policy has its
political impact. Moscow is moving in new directions,
offering an array of initiatives, putting old assumptions
in doubt, attracting new support internationally, and
sometimes placing Western governments on the defen-
sive. This poses a new, continuing, and more
sophisticated challenge to Western policy. Whether re-
cent changes constitute a real opportunity for more
fundamental improvements in relations with the Soviet
Union remains to be seen. We are open-minded on
this score. While recognizing the competitive and
predominantly adversarial character of our relation-
ship, we shall maintain a dialogue with the Soviet
Union in order to seize opportunities for more con-
structive relations.

 

 

Although the Soviet Union still poses the primary
security threat, we and our allies and friends also face
a diversity of other serious security challenges:
regional and low-intensity conflicts; the potential for
nuclear proliferation; international terrorism; narcotics
trafficking; radical politico-religious movements; and
problems of instability, succession, and economic
development in countries that are important friends
and allies.

In Europe, the principal threat to America’s interests,
and to those of our allies, continues to be that posed
by the ongoing buildup of Warsaw Pact military capa-
bilities. For decades the Soviet Union has allocated a
disproportionately high share of its national income to
military expenditures and has created technologically
sophisticated forces far in excess of any plausible need
for self-defense. Equally threatening, but much more
subtle, is the continuous political warfare against
Western cohesion through propaganda, particularly
focused on the younger generations of Western Euro-
peans. Through such means the Soviet Union is
attempting to affect public opinion in allied countries
to weaken relations with the United States, erode the
commitment to defense, and encourage support for
Soviet policies and proposals. Ultimately, the Soviet
Union still seeks to separate Western Europe
politically and militarily from the United States,
thereby altering the global balance of power in the
most fundamental way.

Beyond the challenges in Europe, other areas give
cause for concern. Free World interests in the Middle
East are seriously threatened by the protracted war
between Iran and Iraq, and by Iran’s drive to become
the dominant power in the region. Tehran's threats to
friendly Gulf States and to international shipping in
the Persian Gulf have caused the United States and
several of its allies to provide naval protection for their
own shipping, and to assist certain of the Gulf States.
The aggressive radical regime in Iran persists in
threatening its neighbors which are friends of the
United States with military force, and through ter-
rorism and subversion. Its terrorist surrogates in Leba-
non fuel the anarchy in that stricken country, while
lran advertises its willingness to use terrorism against
United States personnel and facilities in the Middle
East and elsewhere. Whatever lran’s mistrust of the
Soviet Union, Iran's policies undermine Western
friends and Western relationships in the Middle East
and objectively benefit the Soviet Union globally.

 

 

Fragile democratic governments in Central and South
America are being confronted by myriad social and
economic problems. At the same time, radical and in-
surgent groups supported by the Soviets, the San-
dinista regime in Nicaragua, and by Cuba are a
source of political destabilization. Prospects for an en-
during peace in Central America will be bleak as long
as the Sandinista leaders betray their promises of gen-
uinely democratic government and support insurgent
forces attempting to subvert their neighbors.

Other regional tensions and conflicts—such as those
on the Korean peninsula, in Indochina, in Southern
Africa, and between Israel and its Arab neighbors—
threaten both international peace and the internal
stability of friendly states. In the Philippines, for exam-
ple, the fledging democratic government is besieged
by a variety of extremist forces some of which wish to
impose authoritarian regimes.

Low intensity conflicts, the increasing linkages be-
tween international terrorists and narcotics traffickers,
as well as racial, sectarian, and other tensions con-
tinue to challenge U.S. interests and our hopes for
human betterment. Refugees from these conflicts can
place powerful burdens on the economies and
societies of host countries, and require substantial
quantities of international relief.

The spread of nuclear weapons to additional nations
threatens to exacerbate regional conflicts and could
conceivably involve the United States and the Soviet
Union in nuclear conflicts. This proliferation could
ultimately make nuclear deterrence less stable. At this
time, the most difficult regional nuclear rivalry in-
volves India and Pakistan, but other areas of the
world, including the Middle East, Africa, and Latin
America could be subject to similar dangers in the
future.

Although in recent years the international economic
and financial system has proved to be remarkably
resilient, sudden, unexpected shocks can pose major
new challenges to U.S. interests. The hard currency
debts of many developing nations—including several
that are neighbors and important friends and allies of
the United States—have had severe and destabilizing
consequences within their societies. Most of the

 

debtor states have been unable to achieve sustained
and significant economic growth since the early 1980s
and have experienced high rates of unemployment
and inflation, and extended periods of unpopular
austerity. Many of these countries are also adversely
affected by low commodity prices in the international
market, capital flight, excessive government spending,
narcotics production and trafficking, and other in-
digenous and externally imposed problems that will
not be easily remedied. The longer the economies of
the major debtor states fail to rebound from these
conditions, the greater are the possibilities that ir-
responsible elements will gain local support for na-
tionalistic responses that could damage important U.S.
interests.

In addition, rising pressure in some major trading na-

tions for greater protection from foreign competition

could place powerful new downward pressure on
these national economies. Potentially, this could result
in a spiral of protectionist measures that would en- |
danger the international trading system. f

Finally, the prospects for world peace and prosper-
ity—and thus for U.S, interest in a just and progressive ;
international order—will be influenced by other pro- |

blems in certain parts of the world. Critical shortages
of food, a lack of health services, and inabilities to
meet other basic needs will keep millions of people,
particularly in Africa, in peril. The dangerous deple- :
tion or contamination of the natural endowments of
some nations—soil, forests, water, air—will add to their
environmental and health problems, and increasingly
to those of the global community. These problems
cannot be resolved simply through outside assistance,
for many of them will require policy changes and
leadership by governments and elites in the countries
themselves. But all create potential threats to the
peace and prosperity that are in our national interest,
as well as the interests of the affected nations.

In summary, this broad range of threats to our national
interests provides the backdrop against which we for-
mulate our National Security Strategy. As we seek
ways to promote our national interests and objectives,
a careful understanding of these evolving threats is
essential to proper strategy formulation.

 

Ill. Power, Policy, and Strategy

ELEMENTS OF U.S.
NATIONAL POWER

Having described our national security interests, ob-
jectives, and the range of threats that we face, it is
appropriate next to turn to the national means
available to achieve our objectives, and to the strat-
egies that relate means to ends.

The means available are the elements of national
power that the United States possesses—diplomatic
and informational, economic and military—and which
we employ to influence the behavior of other nations.
Power, it is often said, is the quintessence of strategy.
Unfortunately, America’s national power is sometimes
thought of only in coercive or military terms. | believe,
however, that national power is also derived from a
nation’s moral legitimacy and leadership, as we ex-
emplified by the Marshall Plan after World War Il—an
act of strengthening allies, of enlightened self-interest.
Today, nations understand that the effective use of na-
tional power is something more than the simple use
of force; and we seek to follow a National Security
Strategy that ensures we can relate to other nations on
the basis of credibility rather than simple capability.

We have an exceptionally diverse array of instruments
for employing the various elements of national power.
Exercised by the Executive Departments and Agencies,
these tools are most effective when integrated, tailored
to the specific situation, and guided by a common
strategy for their implementation. These instruments
include:

 

 

* Moral and political example. American spirit and
prosperity represent a critical challenge to the
ideology and the practical record of our adversaries:
free, pluralist societies work. Since the days of our
Founding Fathers, this power of example has
represented a potent leverage in international rela-
tions. But we should not leave its expression and
understanding to chance. It is in our interest to
spread this message in an organized and effective
way.

* Military strength. A strong military capability is
essential for a stable, secure environment in which
our adversaries are deterred and diplomacy can be
effective.

* Economic vitality. America’s economic strength sus-
tains our other elements of power and fortifies our
relations with the countries that share our interest
in a free and open international economy.

* Alliance relationships. The pursuit of American
security objectives depends on cooperation with
like-minded international partners. These relation-
ships enhance our strength and mitigate the under-
standable reluctance of the American people to
shoulder security burdens alone. The predictable
difficulties that arise from time to time in all
alliance relationships must be measured against the
enormous benefits that these ties bring us and our
friends.

¢ Public diplomacy. This is a key instrument—one
with an impact both strong and subtle on interna-
tional political events and how people perceive
them. Through our public diplomacy activities, we
seek to explain to foreign audiences our policies
and actions in ways that are clear, credible, and
likely to elicit support for our interests and
objectives.

 

Security assistance. By helping friends and allies ac-
quire the means to defend themselves, we comple-
ment the rebuilding of our own military strength
and increase the human and material resources
available for the defense of free world interests. In
the process, we reduce the likelihood of direct
American involvement in potential conflicts. Secu-
rity assistance is a key instrument in our national
security strategies, a productive and highly lever-
aged investment that promotes our security interests
at bargain prices.

Development assistance. It is in our national interest
to support efforts of friendly developing countries to
provide for the basic needs of their people.
Development assistance plays a vital role in encour-
aging market-oriented approaches with the potential
to increase income levels in recipient countries. A
well structured and financed development
assistance program enhances our world leadership
and influence.

Science and technology cooperation. For many
countries, access to advanced scientific and techno-
logical resources is critical to prosperity and long-
term economic growth. U.S. world leadership and
our vast resources in science and technology are
important strategic assets to strengthen existing ties
with friends and allies, and promote positive rela-
tionships with key developing nations.

International organizations. Multilateral diplomacy
and participation in international organizations such
as the United Nations and the International Mone-
tary Fund provide opportunities to address common
global problems and share the task of solving them.
Skillful diplomacy within these and other multi-
lateral organizations can serve to enhance our
overall goals on issues such as peacekeeping, pro-
motion of human rights, and encouraging the de-
velopment of free economic and political systems.

Diplomatic mediation. In regions where conflict
threatens our interests or those of our friends,
political efforts can play a major role in ending
violence, promoting freedom and national self-
determination, and laying the foundations for future
stability. The initiatives of American diplomacy take
their strength from effective and integrated use of
the tools already discussed, and from the ability of
U.S. representatives to act credibly as mediators of
disputes. Making clear the firmness of our com-
mitments to friends and allies increases the incen-
tives to negotiate seriously.

 

A PERIOD OF TRANSITION

We are living in times that historians will characterize
as a period of transition in international security
affairs. As noted in my first National Security Strategy
Report, this transition really began in the late 1970s
when our policies to rebuild our allies’ economies
had long since succeeded, and America no longer
held an overwhelmingly predominant economic posi-
tion vis-a-vis Western Europe and East Asia. This
realignment of economic strength is likely to continue
into the next decade with the further evolution of East
Asia's industrial economies, particularly that of China.

This transition period has also been marked by the So-
viet Union's massive military buildup—consuming as
much as 15-17 percent of annual GNP. This large, un-
matched investment provided the Soviets by the 1980s
a position of strategic nuclear parity, quantitative con-
ventional force superiority around the Eurasian
rimland, and a modern, globally deployed navy. The
buildup has also supported the projection of Soviet in-
fluence into many areas of the world—particularly the
unstable Third World regions of Southeast and
Southwest Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The
buildup’s consequences will continue to present a ma-
jor threat to our security and that of our allies for
years to come.

Two other major trends characterize this period of
transition in international security affairs. The first is
the revolution in military technology that is already
well underway. New surveillance and targeting sys-
tems, new means of destruction, and low observable
(stealth) technology will soon provide military
capabilities previously thought wholly infeasible.
Similarly, rapid advances in microelectronics will
allow the command, control and communications, in-
tegrated with intelligence sources, to provide the
necessary strategic and tactical direction of such
advanced military operations.

Our military leaders, as well as those of our adver-
saries, are now rethinking military doctrines and force
structures as a result of these and other applications of
advanced technology to military power. As this trend
continues, military competition is likely to focus in-
creasingly on non-nuclear weapons, where the

combinations of stealth and extreme accuracy at long
ranges will reopen the possibility of non-nuclear stra-
tegic attack, Space will also become a more promi-
nent area of activity, not the least because of its grow-
ing importance for air, ground, and naval warfare. We
expect that this revolution in military technology will
continue well into the next decade and necessitate the
adaptation both of military doctrines and of national
security strategies. In this regard, the recent report of
the bipartisan Commission on Integrated Long-Term
Strategy helps bring into focus the essentiality of
maintaining our technological superiority through
coherent military research and development programs
aimed at exploiting emerging strategic opportunities.

The last major trend of this transition period is the dif-
fusion of economic power and advanced technology
to the Third World. This combination of economic
growth and technological maturation has already pro-
vided several countries with an independent capability
to produce large numbers of advanced weapons
systems, both for their own use and for export. Thus,
countries dependent on neither the United States nor
the Soviet Union could in the not too distant future
possess the capability to conduct a major war, either
against each other or against a world power. The
arsenals at the disposal of these sovereign countries
are likely to include chemical weapons, and may
eventually include nuclear weapons and space systems
for target location. As this trend continues, the poten-
tial for mid- and high-intensity conflict increases in
many regions of the world, some of which are already
suffering from various types of low intensity conflict.

In responding to these emerging features of the strate-
gic landscape, we have formulated our strategies to
play to our strengths and to exploit our adversaries’
weaknesses. For example, our defense policies stress
that the United States and its allies must continue to
enjoy technological superiority over the Soviet Union.
The West's spirit of inquiry and the free flow of infor-
mation permit technology and innovation to flourish
to a far greater degree than in a closed society. Our
advantages in areas such as precision guided muni-
tions, stealth technology, submarine quieting, and
super-computer technology are important strategic
assets and we intend to exploit them, and to protect
them from Soviet attempts to acquire them—either by
purchase or theft.

 

In a similar manner, our diplomatic policies are
designed to play to the strength of our alliance rela-
tionships. In Europe, we and our NATO allies are part-
ners in a voluntary coalition of sovereign, equal
nations—in stark contrast to the Warsaw Pact and the
Eastern European countries still dominated by Soviet
military power. In this period of transition we have
new opportunities as our allies display an increasing
willingness to seek a larger role in providing for West-
ern European defense. We welcome this trend, know-
ing we are working from the strength of an abiding
alliance partnership, and that increasing allied con-
tributions are important to assuring the Alliance's long-
term effectiveness and viability.

But the period of transition is not over; and ad-
ministrations after mine will continue to adapt strate-
gic concepts and policies to the realities of an evolv-
ing world—one in which America must always play a
leading role, to help shape a positive future for
ourselves and our allies.

The remainder of this section discusses the fundamen-
tal policies—diplomatic, economic and defense—that
guide our use of the elements of national power as we
formulate strategy, These policy guidelines provide
coherence and consistency among the set of inte-
grated strategies which are discussed in the chapter
that follows.

U.S. DIPLOMATIC POLICY

Policies to Move America
Forward

As | have stated on many occasions, our diplomacy
has aimed at ensuring, in the nuclear age, both peace
and freedom. Working with our allies and friends, we
have sought to push beyond the stalemates of the
postwar era and directly confront two transcendent
issues affecting our national security—the danger of
nuclear warfare and the continuing expansion of totali-
tarian rule.

In dealing with the nuclear threat, we have gone
beyond traditional arms control and, together with our
NATO allies, have sought verifiable reductions in

9

 

 

nuclear arsenals. At the same time, we have launched
a new program of research into ways to defend our-
selves against ballistic missile attack. In doing so, we
seek to maintain deterrence while moving away from
reliance on retaliation, and toward a situation in
which ballistic missiles will ultimately be rendered
obsolete.

While we have sought arms reductions and greater
reliance on defensive measures, we have never lost
sight of the fact that nations do not disagree because
they are armed; they are armed because they disagree
on very important matters of human life and liberty.
The fundamental differences between totalitarian and
democratic rule remain. We cannot gloss them over,
nor can we be content with accepted spheres of in-
fluence, a world only half free. Thus, we have sought
to advance the cause of freedom where opportunities
exist to do so. Sometimes this means support for
liberalization; sometimes support for liberation.

In regional conflicts, for example, we have elaborated
a policy of helping anti-Communist insurgents in their
battle to bring self-determination, independence, and
human rights to their own countries. This doctrine was
first reflected in our decision to assist the people of
Afghanistan in their fight against Soviet invasion and
occupation. It was an important part of our decision
to assist the people of Nicaragua in their battle to
restore the integrity of their 1979 revolution and make
the Sandinista government keep its promise of
democratic rule. Our current efforts in Angola in sup-
port of freedom fighters constitute the most recent ex-
tension of this policy.

Undergirding all of this is our continuing commitment
to public candor about the nature of totalitarian rule
and the ultimate objectives of U.S. foreign policy:
peace, yes, but world freedom as well. We refuse to
believe that it is somehow an act of hostility to pro-
claim publicly the crucial moral distinctions between
democracy and totalitarianism.

Informational Support to
Diplomatic Power

We are faced with a profound challenge to our na-
tional security in the political field. This challenge is
to fight the war of ideas and to help support the

10

 

 

political infrastructure of world democracies. To ac-
complish this we must be as committed to the use of
the informational aspects of our diplomatic power as
to the other elements which comprise it.

Here in the United States, public opinion polls con-
sistently find that, depending on the issue, up to
two-thirds of the American electorate normally take no
interest in foreign policy. Moreover, only a slight ma-
jority of Americans today believe that this country
needs to play an active part in world affairs. There is
no natural domestic constituency for America’s foreign
policy—we must build one.

The agencies which we use to implement such an ap-
proach include the Departments of State and Defense,
Agency for International Development (AID), and U.S.
Information Agency (USIA), as well as several less
traditional participants, including the Departments of
Commerce and Treasury, and the U.S. Trade Repre-
sentative (USTR). All contribute to our Public
Diplomacy and related informational programs.

Another important way of achieving this is through the
private sector. During the past seven years, we have
encouraged the American private sector to become a
key element in the projection of U.S. foreign policy
goals. Leading private citizens and groups have taken
steps to identify and organize the many local forces
throughout America that have a direct stake in our na-
tion’s relations with the rest of the world. These
private voluntary organizations are doing an indispen-
sable job of public education. They have our strongest
encouragement and support.

While we focus on the needs of an effective
diplomatic and informational policy, we must keep in
mind that the Soviet Union is pursuing a very ag-
gressive public deception and propaganda program,
using a wide range of techniques aimed not only at
the Third World, but also at us and our alliance part-
ners. The challenge is to counter Soviet propaganda
and so-called “active measures” using the full range of
our informational programs to tell the truth about
American values, interests, and policies.

Our political and informational power must also reach
to the peoples of denied areas, particularly the USSR
and Eastern Europe—to encourage hope for change
and to educate publics on the benefits of free institu-
tions. We undertake this through the electronic media,
written materials, increased contacts and the exchange
of ideas that come from such contacts. Any process of
change must find its roots within a closed

society, but knowledge of the world at large may be a
stimulant; and the free flow of ideas and information
is, in itself, one of the goals of those who seek
democratic change. For our part, we proceed from our
fundamental belief that a world composed of free,
sovereign democracies will be a safer, more stable
world—one where respect for the dignity of all people
has a better chance to be realized.

U.S. ECONOMIC POLICY

International Economic Policy

U.S. national power rests on the strength of our
domestic economy. A growing, resilient and techno-
logically vigorous economy is vital to our national
security. In peacetime it is the fundamental underpin-
ning of our national defense capabilities. In a crisis or
during wartime it provides the ability to respond
rapidly with skilled personnel, expanded production
capacity, and supplies of critical materials. World Wars
| and || demonstrated the vital importance of a strong
domestic economy able to produce quickly and
efficiently the goods needed to defend ourselves and
our allies.

Our economic strength has domestic and international
dimensions, although the distinctions are neither easy
nor rigid. Domestically, it is in our national security
interest to maintain a dynamic research and develop-
ment capability which enables us to be in the fore-
front of technological advance. Our manufacturing
sector must remain competitive with those in other
leading industrial countries. Our financial and service
industries must provide up-to-date tools for the con-
tinued growth of our economy. Other sectors of the
economy, such as energy and transport, need to be of
sufficient size and diversity to provide a critical nu-
cleus should we need to respond to an emergency.
Finally, our labor force is—and will remain—a key ele-
ment of our economic strength. An innovative, adap-
tive and educated labor force remains essential to the
development of new technologies, the continued
growth of our economy and the production of com-
petitive goods.

While mindful of the need for a strong domestic
economy, we do not—and should not—strive for
domestic economic self-sufficiency or’ for dominance

 

 

in all economic sectors. Market economies are in-
terdependent. Since 1945, we have pursued a vigorous
policy, first, of helping rebuild the European and
Pacific economies devastated by war; and second, of
supporting economic cooperation and development
among all Free World economies. We strongly be-
lieved then—as we do now—that national economic
strength is a shared strength. For example, we support
European efforts at economic integration through the
European Community because we believe that a
strong European economy will be better able to con-
tribute the resources necessary for a strong Alliance
defense. Likewise, the Free Trade Area Agreement
recently negotiated with our largest trading partner,
Canada, directly and positively contributes to our col-
lective security in North America. Just as our defense
depends on the cooperation and participation of our
allies, so does our economic prosperity. Thus our
economic objectives in support of our security
policies are necessarily global. However, one central
consequence of our interdependence is that we can-
not dictate economic policy but must consult and
negotiate, recognizing the realities of mutual
dependence.

As the world’s leading economic power, we have a
responsibility by our actions at home to help sustain
and extend the global economic recovery. The un-
precedented peacetime expansion of the American
economy since 1982 provides a vivid demonstration of
the power and creativity that free enterprise can
unleash. However, the United States has not ac-
complished this alone. International flows of people,
capital and goods have enabled us to improve our
standard of living far beyond that which would have
resulted from a closed economy. In return, American
technology, capital and goods have enabled other
countries to improve their economies. Our success
also provides constructive examples of the benefits of
open societies and economies. At home we must im-
plement economic policies that continue to promote
growth, while holding down inflation and reducing
the federal deficit by controlled government spending.
The budget compromise which we reached late last
year with the leaders of the Congress is an important
step toward those ends. Limiting the cost of central
government will allow resources to be more produc-
tively used by the private sector. By reducing the
federal deficit and promoting private saving, we can
reduce undue dependence on inflows of foreign capi-
tal and play a stronger role in providing capital to
support growth in the global economy.

11

A natural consequence of societies’ striving to grow
and be competitive in the world economy is periodic
tension manifested in trade disputes and other bi-
lateral economic difficulties. The United States, as the
leading proponent of an open international trading
system, has led in the construction of the present
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
system, which has promoted over the years a vigorous
expansion of trade to the benefit of all. We are now
seeking to strengthen that system and bring it up to
date. We strongly support the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade negotiations which aims further to
reduce barriers to global trade. For the first time,
agriculture, intellectual property rights, trade in ser-
vice (such as banking, insurance and transportation),
and investment will be the focus of serious
negotiation.

History has shown that free, open economies with
unrestricted trade are strong economies, which grow
faster and have the resources with which to defend
themselves. Open trade and cooperation among na-
tions also help to cement alliances which in turn
bolsters our coalition defense efforts. The challenge to
the United States now is to avoid letting tensions and
disputes over trade issues undermine domestic sup-
port for free trade, or become a catalyst for policies
which only serve to reduce overall economic growth,
and thus work in opposition to our security objectives.
In this regard, we must actively resist the temptation
to impose protectionist measures in order to cope
with trade imbalances, while responding to the
legitimate concerns of U.S. industry about the unfair
trade practices of other countries. Protectionist trade
legislation would be a major threat to our economic
health, to economic and political relations with our
allies, and to our collective economic and military
strength.

There are times, however, when we must restrict
economic relations between the United States and
other countries not only for reasons of national securi-
ty, but to protest odious national behavior. By restric-
ting economic relations, we seek vigorously to
persuade the target country that its behavior is unac-
ceptable. For example, U.S. economic leverage is
employed against nations that threaten regional stabili-
ty or support international terrorism, such as Cuba,
Libya and Nicaragua. However, economic sanctions

12

 

 

are never imposed without careful consideration, as
they inevitably impose costs on American business as
well as foreign clients. For that reason our policy will
continue to be to use them sparingly, and only con-
tinue them when their need and effectiveness can be
clearly demonstrated.

Energy is an important underpinning to our economic,
industrial and military strength, and thus to our na-
tional security. Over the long term, our national
energy policy is aimed at ensuring adequate supplies
of energy at reasonable prices by strengthening
domestic energy industries, diversifying energy
sources, and improving energy efficiency. We are
working through the International Energy Agency to
assist our allies to develop complementary strategies.
More immediate objectives are to reduce the nation’s
vulnerability to disruptions in foreign energy supplies
and to lessen the impact on the civil economy if
disruptions should occur. This includes plans for in-
creasing the size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,
promoting international cooperation with allies and
partners in the International Energy Agency, and en-
couraging research into economically viable tech-
nologies that increase energy efficiency or that make
use of alternative sources of power.

Internationally, we have led in the coordination of
economic policy among the major industrialized
countries. in addition, we will continue to assist
developing countries to realize sustained, non-
inflationary growth, since we understand that this is in
our mutual economic and security interest. We will
encourage an effective adjustment process for debtor
nations, supported by adequate private and public
financing. To help debtor countries, we have expressed
our willingness to negotiate additional resources for
the World Bank. The United States has welcomed a
proposed enlargement of the IMF's Structural Adjust-
ment Facility. We also have proposed a broadened
IMF facility to provide a financial cushion for
vulnerable developing countries dealing with the
vicissitudes of external economic forces.

As noted earlier, our nation’s defense edge is based on
technological, rather than numerical superiority. If we
lose this edge, we also lose an essential element

of our military deterrent. There is concern that the

loss of advanced production capabilities in critical in-
dustries could place our defense manufacturing base
in jeopardy. We must avoid situations where increased
reliance on other countries for advances in critical
technologies could, over the long term, turn into
vulnerabilities.

Furthermore, the fruits of the free-market economy
must not strengthen the military capability of our
adversaries. We, as well as our allies, must continue to
ensure that economic relationships with the Soviet
bloc do not weaken our national security. For exam-
ple, we have reached agreement on eliminating pref-
erential credit terms to the Soviet Union. Working
through the International Energy Agency, we and our
allies have reduced the substantial risk of Western
European dependence on Soviet energy. Acting with
our allies through the Coordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), we are making
progress toward ensuring that militarily-sensitive
technology does not flow to the Soviet Union and that
competitor firms in COCOM member nations bear the
same export restrictions as U.S. firms. We will con-
tinue to improve the COCOM review process, to har-
monize and tighten national licensing and
enforcement procedures, and to encourage greater
cooperation with allies and friends. The dual objec-
tives of protecting and sharing militarily significant
technologies pose a challenge, one made more dif-
ficult by rapid technological changes. But it is a
challenge we must meet.

We willingly offer our philosophy of free-market econ-
omies to centrally planned regimes. Indeed, it is only
by adopting market mechanisms that these regimes
can satisfy the economic needs and desires of their
peoples. However, market economies only flourish
where freedom and individual rights are encouraged.
The IMF, GATT and other international economic in-
stitutions are mainly concerned with improving rela-
tions among free individuals, businesses and financial
institutions. While we note recent Soviet policy
statements regarding “reconstruction” and economic
reform, the Soviet economic system remains at this
point fundamentally incompatible with participation in
free-world institutions. Policy statements must be
translated into positive actions before such participa-
tion can be considered.

 

 

U.S. DEFENSE POLICY

A Policy of Deterrence

The third element of U.S. national power is military. In
some cases, the integrated use of the other elements
of national power will be insufficient to meet the
threats to our security interests. We therefore must
be—and are—ready to employ military power in coor-
dination with the other elements. However, the ulti-
mate goal when applying military force, or projecting
military power, is to encourage politica! solutions.
War is the least desirable alternative, but only by
being prepared to wage war successfully can we deter
it.

America’s defense policy throughout the postwar
period has been aimed at deterring aggression against
the United States and its allies. Deterrence works by
persuading potential adversaries that the costs of their
aggression will exceed any probable gains. Deterrence
is the basis of our military strategy against conven-
tional as well as nuclear aggression. Because any con-
flict carries the risk of escalation, our goal is to
dissuade aggression of any kind.

We seek also to prevent coercion of the United States,
its allies, and friends. Successful coercion could give a
hostile power the benefits of victory without the cost
of war. As discussed earlier, the Soviet threat manifests
itself not only in the danger of an actual attack, but in
the form of propaganda, intimidation and coercion as
well. The Soviets still seek to dominate Western
Europe and Japan without having to fire a shot—a
coercive threat which must and will be deterred by
our political determination, our defense capabilities,
and our alliance relationships.

To deter the Soviet Union, we must make clear to its
leaders that we have the means and the will to res-
pond effectively to coercion or aggression against our
security interests. While emphasizing our resolve to
respond, our policy is to avoid specifying exactly what
our response will be. This is the essense of our
strategic doctrine of “flexible response,’ which has
been United States policy since 1961 and NATO
strategy since 1967. Specifically, our forces deter a
potential aggressor by confronting him with three
types of possible responses from which we would
choose at the appropriate time:

13

® Direct Defense: To confront an adversary with the
possibility that his aggression will be stopped with-
out our resorting to actions which escalate the con-
flict. This is sometimes referred to as “deterrence
through denial’ Defeating a nonnuclear attack with
conventional forces only would be an example of
direct defense.

© The Threat of Escalation: To warn an adversary that
his aggression could start hostilities that might not
be confined in the manner he hopes or envisions
and that escalation could exact far greater costs
than he anticipates, or could bear. In this regard,
NATO's deterrence of a Soviet conventional attack is
enhanced by our ability and resolve to use nuclear
weapons, if necessary, to halt aggression.

¢ The Threat of Retaliation: To raise the prospect that
an attack will trigger a retaliatory attack on the ag-
gressors homeland, causing his losses far to exceed
any possible gains, Our deterrence of a Soviet nu-
clear attack on the United States is based on our
resolve to retaliate directly against the Soviet
Union.

Maintaining Strategic
Deterrence

While deterrence requires capabilities across the entire
spectrum of conflict, its essential foundation is pro-
vided by our strategic nuclear forces and the doctrine
which supports them. Nuclear deterrence, like any
form of deterrence, requires us to consider not what
would deter us, but what would deter a potential at-
tacker, particularly one whose perceptions of the
world and value system are substantially different from
our own. Since we can never be entirely certain of
Soviet perceptions, we must ensure that both the
effectiveness of our strategic forces and our will to use
them, if necessary, are never in doubt.

In the interest of ensuring deterrence, the United
States maintains diversified strategic retaliatory forces
to hedge against a disarming first strike, to complicate
Soviet attack plans, and to guard against technological
surprise. To this end we maintain a variety of basing
modes, launch platforms, and attack vehicles, achiev-
ing diversity through a triad of submarine launched
ballistic missiles (SLBMs), intercontinental ballistic
missiles (ICBMs) and bombers. Adequate and sur-
vivable command, control and communications are

14

 

essential to our strategic force structure and critical to
the credibility of our strategic deterrent.

Our strategic forces and the associated targeting policy
must, by any calculation, be perceived as making nu-
clear warfare a totally unacceptable and unrewarding
proposition for the Soviet leadership. Accordingly, our
targeting policy:

¢ Denies the Soviets the ability to achieve essential
military objectives by holding at risk Soviet war-
making capabilities, including both the full range of
Soviet military forces and the war-supporting in-
dustry which provides the foundation for Soviet
military power and supports its capability to con-
duct a protracted conflict; and

* Places at risk those political entities the Soviet
leadership values most: the mechanisms for ensur-
ing survival of the Communist Party and its leader-
ship cadres, and for retention of the Party's control
over the Soviet and Soviet-bloc peoples.

This basic policy of targeting those assets which are
essential to Soviet warmaking capability and political
control has been an integral part of U.S. strategy for
many years. In implementing this policy, the United
States does not target population as an objective in
itself and seeks to minimize collateral damage through
more accurate, lower yield weapons.

Holding at risk the full range of Soviet assets is
necessary for an effective deterrent, but is not suffi-
cient. As President, | cannot be limited to the options
of capitulation or massive mutual destruction in re-
sponse to aggression. We must have flexibility in the
employment of our strategic forces. For our deterrent
to be credible, it must be clear to the Soviets that the
United States has military options appropriate to a
broad range of plausible situations.

Finally, the United States requires sufficient residual
capability to provide leverage for early war termina-
tion, and to avoid coercion in a post-conflict world.
For this reason, we maintain a nuclear reserve force as
an integral part of our strategic forces. In addition, we
maintain Continuity of Government programs to en-
sure the Soviets cannot escape retaliation by initiating
a quick, “decapitating” attack aimed at incapacitating
our political and military leadership. Our civil defense
program also contributes to the Nation’s preparedness
in the event of an attack.

These capabilities do not imply that we seek the
ability to fight a nuclear war. | have repeatedly em-
phasized that a nuclear war cannot be won and must
never be fought. But we must deter an adversary who
has a very different strategic outlook from our own—
an outlook which continues to place great stress on
nuclear warfighting capability. It is essential the
Soviets understand that they cannot gain their objec-
tives through nuclear warfare, or nuclear coercion,
under any conceivable circumstances.

Our policy of flexible response and deterrence
through the threat of offensive retaliation has
preserved the security of the United States and its
allies for decades. Looking to the future, the Strategic
Defense Initiative offers an opportunity to shift deter-
rence to a safer and more stable basis through greater
reliance on strategic defenses. Such defenses, which
threaten no one, would enhance deterrence by inject-
ing greater uncertainties into Soviet estimates of their
ability to achieve their military objectives should they
attempt a first strike. Even less than perfect defense
could increase stability by denying the Soviets con-
fidence that they could achieve meaningful military
goals, thereby eliminating incentives for a Soviet first
strike. In judging the suitability of systems for possible
deployment, we will continue to be guided by the cri-
teria of military effectiveness, survivability, and cost-
effectiveness at the margin.

By reducing the military value of ballistic missiles,
strategic defenses would facilitate Soviet acceptance of
significant arms reduction agreements. In a world with
fewer ballistic missiles, however, Soviet incentives to
not abide by such agreements would be greater.
Strategic defense can effectively negate such incentives
by eliminating the utility of covertly stockpiled
missiles. Thus enhanced strategic defenses offer the
prospect of a safer, more stable world in which deep
reductions in strategic offensive arms are both
negotiable and enforceable. We will continue to try to
persuade the Soviets to join with us in working out a
stable transition to this desirable goal.

Continuing the modernization of our strategic forces is
essential to assure reliable deterrence, enhance stabili-
ty, and provide motivation for the Soviets to negotiate
broad, deep, equitable and verifiable reductions in
strategic offensive arms. While we are firmly commit-
ted to using arms reductions as one component of our
policy for enhancing U.S. and allied security, success
in arms negotiations does not alter the need for

modern, effective, survivable nuclear forces to provide
deterrence, promote stability, and hedge against Soviet
cheating or abrogation. Nor does it eliminate the need
for a nuclear weapons production complex capable of
supporting such weapons in the future. Neglecting
modernization in expectation of arms reduction
agreements would actually decrease the likelihood of
such agreements by reducing Soviet incentives to
negotiate.

For their part, the Soviets continue to invest heavily in
accurate, fast-flying ballistic missiles which can destroy
hard targets. Their goal has been, and remains, an ef-
fective disarming first-strike capability. Moreover, they
are continuing to enhance their ICBM survivability
through silo hardening and mobility, including deploy-
ment of the road-mobile SS-25 and the rail-based
SS-24. At the same time, they invest roughly the same
amount in their strategic defense programs as in their
offensive force modernization. They are expanding
and improving the world’s only deployed anti-ballistic
missile (ABM) system, violating the ABM Treaty with
construction of their radar at Krasnoyarsk and other
radar deployments, and increasing their capability to
deploy a territorial ABM defense. Their vast growing
network of deep underground leadership shelters is
aimed at ensuring the survival of Communist Party
control over the Soviet nation, economy, and military
forces in war. Their strategic communications are
highly redundant, survivable, and hardened against
nuclear effects.

In response to the buildup of Soviet capabilities, the
United States is continuing the Strategic Moderniza-
tion Program in order to maintain the essential sur-
vivability and mission-effectiveness of our own forces.
The Soviets’ active and passive defenses, their buildup
of offensive forces, and their published doctrine all
continue to provide evidence of Soviet nuclear war-
fighting mentality, and underline the essentiality of
maintaining an effective U.S. deterrent through support
for this highest priority defense program.

Arms Reductions

Arms contro! is not an end in itself, but only one of
several tools to enhance our national security. Our
arms reductions objectives are fully integrated with
our national security policies to enhance deterrence,
reduce risk, support alliance relationships, and ensure
the Soviets do not gain significant unilateral
advantage.

15

 

Based on this view of arms contro] as a complement
to a strong national defense posture, we have been
guided since the beginning of this Administration by
several fundamental principles:

* The United States seeks only those agreements
which contribute to our security and that of our
allies.

© The United States seeks agreements which reduce
arms, not simply limit their increase.

* Achieving verifiable agreements on broad, deep
and equitable reductions in offensive nuclear arms
is the highest arms control priority of the United
States.

¢ Within the category of offensive nuclear arms, the
United States gives priority to reducing the most
destabilizing weapons: fast-flying, non-recallable
ballistic missiles.

© The United States also seeks equitable arms control
measures in the area of nuclear testing, chemical
weapons and conventional forces.

¢ The United States insists on agreements that can be
effectively verified and fully complied with. Arms
control agreements without effective verification
measures are worse than no agreements at all, as
they create the possibility of Soviet unilateral ad-
vantage, and can affect U.S. and allied planning
with a false sense of confidence.

Our perseverance in adhering to these principles paid
off on December 8, 1987, when Soviet General
Secretary Gorbachev and | signed a treaty on
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) eliminating
all U.S. and Soviet ground-launched ballistic and
cruise missiles and their launchers, with ranges
between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. The INF agree-
ment is an important tribute to NATO solidarity, per-
sistence, and political courage.

The Soviet Union, because of its massive buildup, is
required by the treaty to eliminate an INF missile
force capable of carrying four times as many warheads
as the United States. Thus, the treaty establishes the
important principle of asymmetry in arms reduction
agreements, to compensate for large Soviet quan-
titative advantages. It is noteworthy that the systems
the Soviets must eliminate are primarily based within
the Soviet Union, where they are not particularly
vulnerable to conventional attack in a possible NATO-
Warsaw Pact conflict. In contrast, the U.S. systems to

16

 

be eliminated are high priority targets for Soviet con-
ventional attack. Finally, the Soviet systems eliminated,
particularly the shorter-range INF missiles, have
chemical and conventional as well as nuclear
capabilities, and could be employed against NATO
bases and forces during non-nuclear phases of a
NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict.

The military benefits of the INF Treaty will be even
greater if we succeed in negotiating a treaty on strate-
gic arms reductions. An agreement which significantly
reduces strategic systems will lessen Soviet capability
for a first strike, inhibit their ability to use intercon-
tinental weapons against theater targets, and substan-
tially increase the Soviets’ uncertainty of
accomplishing their political ends through military
means.

While reducing the Soviet threat, the INF treaty does
not alter NATO's basic approach to deterrence. NATO's
strategy of flexible response continues to demand a
strong allied nuclear capability. Fears that an INF
agreement will somehow decouple the defense of
Europe from the U.S. nuclear arsenal are based on
fundamental misunderstandings of the U.S. commit-
ment and capability to participate in the defense of
Europe. The United States retains substantial nuclear
capabilities in Europe to counter Warsaw Pact conven-
tional superiority, and to serve as a link to U.S.
strategic nuclear forces. NATO aircraft will continue to
have the capability to hold at risk a broad range of
targets, including those within the Soviet homeland. In
addition, U.S. sea-based forces assigned to NATO will
continue to provide Alliance authorities with a com-
parable targeting capability. Thus, the Soviets can be
under no illusion that they could attack NATO without
placing their own territory at risk.

Eliminating an entire class of ground-launched
missiles, while an achievement of historical propor-
tions, does not remove the large Soviet conventional
and chemical threat to Europe. The next NATO prior-
ity for arms control, therefore, is to redress existing
imbalances in conventional and chemical warfare
capabilities which favor the Soviet Union. Recogniz-
ing this, the Alliance Foreign Ministers meeting in
Reykjavik, Iceland in June 1987 called for a coherent
and comprehensive concept of arms control which
reduces remaining European-based nuclear forces only
in conjunction with the establishment of a conven-
tional balance, and the global elimination of chemical
weapons. | fully support this approach.

The most important unfinished arms control task is to
achieve deep reductions in strategic offensive arms.
Both we and the Soviets have introduced draft texts for
strategic arms reduction treaties (START). Our ap-
proach provides for specific restrictions on the most
destabilizing systems—fast-flying ballistic missiles,
especially heavy Soviet ICBMs. We are pursuing a
goal first agreed to in October 1986 and reaffirmed
during the December 1987 Summit: a 50 percent
reduction in strategic offensive forces to a total of
6,000 warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles. We are
negotiating seriously; if the Soviets are willing to
match our seriousness, agreement is possible. At the
same time, a bad agreement is worse than no agree-
ment, and we will not accept any agreement which
does not enhance our security.

We are also engaged in a wide variety of arms
negotiations and discussions on other subjects. The
U.S. approach to all of these areas is consistent; we
seek only those agreements which are equitable,
verifiable, and will enhance our security and that of
our allies.

Specifically:

© Consistent with our belief that strategic defenses
may offer a safer, more stable basis for deterrence,
we seek Soviet agreement for an orderly transition
to a more defense-reliant world.

© We seek an effective and verifiable global ban on
chemical weapons.

© We seek alliance-to-alliance negotiations to
establish a more secure and stable balance in con-
ventional forces at lower levels from the Atlantic to
the Urals. Any steps ultimately taken in this area
must be effectively verifiable and must recognize
the geographic and force asymmetries between the
two sides. Alliance policy in this regard, which we
fully support, is quite clear—increased security and
stability, not reductions per se, are the objectives of
Western conventional arms control efforts. Given
the Warsaw Pacts conventional superiority in cer-
tain key areas—particularly those important for of-
fensive operations—even modest reductions in
NATO forces, in the ‘absence of larger reductions
from the Warsaw Pact, would reduce NATO's
security and would not promote stability. The
challenge is to synchronize NATO's force improve-
ment plans and conventional! arms control efforts

 

toward the long-term goals of increased security and
stability.

© In the area of nuclear testing, on November 9, 1987,
we began formal negotiations with the Soviets on
essential verification improvements to permit
ratification of existing treaties: the Threshold Test
Ban Treaty, and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosion
Treaty. Once our verification concerns have been
satisfied and the treaties ratified, we would be
prepared immediately to engage in negotiations
with the Soviets on ways to implement a step-by-
step program to limit and ultimately end nuclear
testing, in association with a program to reduce and
ultimately eliminate all nuclear weapons. Until that
ultimate stage has been reached, however, the
United States must continue testing to maintain a
safe and reliable deterrent.

© Finally, we seek to enhance stability through im-
proved measures which could prevent misunder-
standing. To this end, we signed an agreement with
the Soviets on September 15, 1987, to establish
Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers in each national
capital as a mechanism to avoid incidents resulting
from accident or miscalculation during periods of
tension.

In all of these areas we consider effective verification
provisions to be as important as specific negotiated
limits; they must be negotiated concurrently. We can-
not accept obligations that limit our military programs
unless we can effectively verify Soviet compliance
with those same obligations. This is particularly im-
portant in light of the continuing pattern of Soviet
violations documented in the several reports which |
have submitted to the Congress on Soviet non-
compliance.

We have made solid progress in the area of arms
reductions. Sound agreements—those that enhance our
security and that of our Allies—require patience, firm-
ness and strength. If we continue to display these
qualities, and if the Soviets are willing to build on the
progress we have made, arms reductions can help
keep us on the path toward greater stability and a
safer world. In moving to that world, | will maintain
my commitment to broad, deep, equitable, and
verifiable arms reductions, focused especially on
ballistic missiles, and my equally strong commitment
to the Strategic Defense Initiative.

17

Maintaining Conventional
Deterrence

Modern strategic nuclear capabilities are essential for
deterrence, but they alone are obviously not enough.
The United States and its allies require robust
conventional forces, backed by adequate theater nu-
clear capabilities, as an integral part of our overall
deterrent. As noted earlier, U.S. National Security
Strategy has historically been based on the concepts
of forward defense and alliance solidarity. Consistent
with that strategy, we maintain large, forward
deployed forces at sea and on the territory of our
NATO and Asian allies in time of peace. The overall
size, capabilities, and characteristics of U.S. Armed
Forces are strongly influenced by the need to
maintain such presence, which is essential to deter
aggression.

The most demanding threat with which those forces
must deal is, of course, the Soviet Union. Soviet forces
will always outnumber our own in any presently
foreseeable conflict—particularly when viewed in
terms of active forces and major items of combat
equipment. For this reason we must continue to give
the most careful attention to ensuring our forces’
technological superiority and high readiness to
accomplish their deterrent and warfighting missions.

An additional premise of American defense policy is
that the United States does not seek to deal with the
threat from the Soviet Union unaided. A system of vig-
orous alliances is essential to deterrence; and the
most important of these is NATO. The United States
contributes to the NATO deterrent in several ways.
Most visible is the peacetime stationing of over
300,000 military personnel in the Alliance area. This
significant presence of U.S. forces makes it clear that it
is not possible to attack a NATO ally without
simultaneously engaging the full military might of the
United States. The proximity of major Warsaw Pact
ground, air and naval forces to Alliance territory, the
speed with which modern conflict can unfold, the
Pact's significant numerical advantages, and the
Soviets’ strong doctrinal emphasis on surprise, all
argue for the continuation of substantial, qualitatively
advanced U.S. and allied conventional forces in
Europe.

In addition to the direct provision of forces, the
United States provides security assistance to those
NATO allies whose economies do not permit them to

18

 

make as great a contribution to the common defense

as we and they would wish; and we encourage the

more affluent Alliance members to do so as well.

Such assistance serves as an important force
multiplier—increasing both the political solidarity and f
the military effectiveness of NATO.

Under NATO military strategy, the land-based forces of |
the Alliance nations, including the United States,
would have primary responsibility for blunting a
Warsaw Pact attack and defending Allied territory,
while simultaneously disrupting and destroying the
follow-on forces which Soviet strategy relies upon to
exploit any initial successes. Allied ground forces,
supported by tactical air power, require the capability
to halt a Pact attack and restore the integrity of
Alliance territory if NATO political and military
objectives are to be achieved. Absent such capability,
Alliance strategy becomes heavily dependent on the
threat of resorting to nuclear weapons to achieve
essential deterrence and warfighting objectives.

The capability needed to halt such a Warsaw Pact
attack, without risking an early transition to nuclear
war, is the principal determinant of the size and
composition of the more than 300,000 military
personnel we currently have forward deployed in
Europe. In collaboration with our allies, U.S. military
planners consider the Pact’s capabilities, the battle
terrain, allied capabilities, and NATO strategy when
determining the size, composition, and location of our
contribution of forward deployed forces along the 720
kilometer Central front, and on the flanks and
adjoining seas.

In addition, certain U.S. forces perform functions for
the theater that are not within the capability of our
allies, such as certain types of reconnaissance and
intelligence missions; or they provide the capability to
receive and rapidly deploy reinforcements and
resupply received from the United States. While
marginal changes may be feasible in the future, with

adjustments in the U.S-allied division of labor, the (

basic U.S. contribution has been carefully planned to

assure that the strategy for the defense of Western {
Uy

Europe, and the U.S. contribution to it, are militarily
effective, and are seen by our adversaries to be so.

In addition to the right numbers and mix of units, U.S.
and allied forces require constant upgrading and
modernization to retain a qualitative edge in the face
of the Pacts superior numbers and rapidly improving

technologies. Our policies relating to force moder-
nization and retention of our technological edge em-
phasize cooperation among the Allies on research,
development, and production. This approach reduces
duplication of R&D resources, shares the best
available allied technology, promotes interoperable
equipment, and provides incentives for our Allies to
increase their contribution to Alliance capabilities.
Congressional initiatives aimed at stimulating
cooperative R&D have aided materially in advancing
these programs.

NATO's strategy of flexible response requires a
capability for Alliance reaction appropriate to the
nature of Soviet provocation. In addition to conven-
tional forces, this strategy must be supported by effec-
tive and substantial theater nuclear forces. In contrast
to the policy of the Soviet Union, it is NATO's policy
to maintain theater nuclear forces at the lowest level
capable of deterring the threat. In pursuit of this
policy, the Alliance decided in October 1983 to
reduce the number of warheads in Europe. These
reductions, taken independently of any arms reduction
agreement, decreased NATO's nuclear stockpile in
Europe to the lowest level in over 20 years. This
makes it essential that the remaining stockpile be
modern, survivable, and effective.

With the prospective removal of our INF forces in
Europe, it will be particularly important that our re-
maining theater nuclear forces be fully capable of
supporting the Alliance's flexible response strategy. We
have examined the military implications of the treaty
from that standpoint and are confident that the
resulting force structure will provide the necessary
military capability, provided that necessary force
modernization continues and that we effectively
capitalize on available nuclear weapons delivery
platforms.

While neither NATO nor the United States seeks to
match the Soviets weapon for weapon, deterrence
would be dangerously weakened if the Soviets were
allowed to field a major capability which was com-
pletely unmatched by a countervailing NATO
capability. This premise underlies our determination
to modernize U.S. chemical weapons capability
through development of modern, safe, binary muni-
tions. This modernization will provide us the capabili-
ty needed to deter Soviet first use of chemical
weapons. Absent such capability, we will remain

 

dependent on a stockpile of obsolescent chemical
weapons ill-suited to modern delivery systems. This
places undue reliance on Alliance nuclear capabilities
to deter Soviet first use of chemical weapons—an ob-
viously undesirable and risky situation.

USS. strategy recognizes that the Soviet Union is
capable of simultaneous aggression in more than one
region. Should aggression occur in several areas
simultaneously, U.S. responses would be governed by
existing commitments, general strategic priorities, the
specific circumstances at hand, and the availability of
forces, Our strategy is not to try to fight “everywhere
at once” We would do what is strategically sensible
and operationally achievable under the circumstances.
Our capability to respond would be enhanced by the
flexibility we have built into our force structure, in-
cluding capabilities for global strategic mobility and
power projection. This visible capability to respond ef-
fectively in distant theaters reduces the risk that we
will ever have to meet such attacks.

NATO is not our only alliance. The United States has
bilateral or multilateral security commitments with
some 43 nations around the globe, including impor-
tant treaties with Japan, the Republic of Korea, and
Australia.

In support of those commitments, and to deter adven-
turisrn by the Soviets and their client states, we main-
tain forward deployed forces in other regions of
strategic importance. Our naval forces deployed in the
Pacific and Indian Oceans assist in protecting our
growing strategic and economic interests, and suppor-
ting allies and friends, in Asia and the Pacific.
Substantial ground and air forces are deployed in
Korea to complement forces of the Republic of Korea
in deterring aggression from the North. Naval and
tactical air forces deployed throughout the Pacific
assist in meeting our security commitments to such
nations as Japan and the Philippines.

These global forward deployed forces serve several
functions. They are essential to the creation of
regional power balances which deter Soviet aggres-
sion and promote overall regional stability. They sup-
port the political independence of nations on the
Soviet periphery, hence are key to the fundamental
U.S. security objective of avoiding Soviet domination
of the Eurasian landmass. Finally, they provide an
immediately available capability to deal with lesser

19

military contingencies. However, for military con-
tingencies not involving the Soviet Union, we look
primarily to the nations involved to provide for their
own defense.

In the past seven years we have made substantial pro-
gress in improving the capability of our forward
deployed forces to protect U.S. interests, execute our
military strategy, and support alliance commitments.
We remain firmly committed to continued improve-
ment in our deployed capabilities in support of our
forward-defense, alliance-based strategy. The following
paragraphs will discuss selected capabilities which
provide essential foundations for that strategy.

* Maintenance of Global Support and Mobility
Capabilities.

The ability to reinforce and resupply forward deployed
forces is essential to the execution of U.S. military
strategy. A credible U.S. capability to reinforce NATO
rapidly during times of tension, for example, is critical
to effective deterrence.

The Soviets have a natural geographic advantage in
military operations on the Eurasian rim, and growing
capabilities to launch simultaneous offensives in
Europe, Southwest Asia and the Far East. Capitalizing
on interior lines of communication, they can redeploy
and resupply forces over a broad geographic range.
Recent Soviet efforts have significantly improved
military access by rail and road to strategically
important areas along the USSR’s southern frontiers,

Our global support and mobility capabilities, in-
cluding airlift, sealift, and prepositioning, are therefore
essential to allow us to meet military challenges
around the periphery of the Eurasian continent, which
remains the primary locus of Soviet expansionist in-
terests. Prepositioning ashore or at sea can sharply
reduce our response times. Airlift, the quickest and
most flexible of our mobility assets, would deliver in-
itial reinforcements in most contingencies, but sealift
will inevitably carry the bulk of our reinforcement and
resupply, as it has in past crises. Mobility capabilities
are especially critical to our strategy for dealing with
contingencies in Southwest Asia, where we have no
military bases or permanently stationed military
forces,

20

 

 

® Maintenance of an Adequate tugistics Base.

To maintain a strong conventional deterrent, it is vital
that we provide adequate logistic support for U.S.
forces. A robust logistics infrastructure strengthens
deterrence by demonstrating our preparations for
hostilities at any level of intensity, and for the length
of time necessary to defend U.S. interests. Adequate,
sustained support helps raise the nuclear threshold
and improves prospects for early success in conflict.
Adversaries must not conclude that U.S. and allied
capabilities would be exhausted if confronted with a
complex or prolonged military campaign. With the
support of Congress we will seek continued improve-
ment in this unglamorous but essential component of
military power. Concurrently, we will continue to
emphasize to our allies that the sustainment of their
forces in combat must parallel that of our own.

* Maintenance of Adequate Active Forces.

Support of our conventional deterrent requires that we
maintain balanced and effective active duty forces
sufficient in quality and quantity to make our national
military strategy credible. In the context of our
alliance relationships, deterring and, if necessary
defeating, the Soviet threat requires a carefully
structured mix of U.S. and allied land and sea-based
forces capable of executing the agreed strategy until
reinforced from the respective national mobilization
bases.

While NATO requirements are the primary focus of
our ground forces’ concern, the global nature of
potential threats to U.S. interests requires maintenance
of flexible and diverse ground forces capable of rapid
deployment to, and sustained operations in, other
areas of strategic importance as well. This has led the
Army to establish rapidly deployable light divisions,
while continuing efforts have gone into the enhance-
ment of Marine Corps capabilities and amphibious lift.

U.S. tactical airpower supports the achievement of
theater campaign goals by maintaining battlefield air
superiority, providing responsive and effective
firepower for ground combat units, and conducting
deep interdiction of enemy forces, command and con-
trol facilities, and sources of logistics support. In addi-
tion, in the European theater, it plays a critical role in
assuring the essential reinforcement and resupply of
U.S. forward deployed forces by protecting port

facilities, aerial ports of debarkation, prepositioned
equipment and munitions, and lines of communica-
tion. The capability of air forces to deploy rapidly in
crises adds to our ability to bring effective military
power to bear in distant regions in contingencies.

Maritime forces also play a unique role in supporting
our national military strategy. Given the realities of our
geostrategic position, fronting on two oceans,
maritime superiority over any potential adversary is
essential to support our alliance relationships and for-
ward deployed forces. The capability of Navy and
Marine Corps forces to project and sustain military
power in areas distant from our shores is of particular
importance, given the central position of the Soviet
Union on the Eurasian land mass and the fact that
many of the United States’ most important allies are
located on the Eurasian periphery, accessible from the
sea.

Our naval power projection forces would also play a
major role in any Southwest Asia contingency. Their
current presence in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea,
together with Army and Air Force units, is providing
essential support for several important national securi-
ty objectives.

Maintaining a National
Mobilization Base

The effective mobilization of manpower and industrial
resources in the event of a conflict would provide
essential support for our military capabilities. Realistic
mobilization plans also provide a clear means for the
United States to communicate its resolve to our
potential adversaries in periods of tension or crisis.

On the industrial side, the maintenance of a broad,
technologically superior mobilization base is a
fundamental element of U.S. defense policy. As |
noted when discussing the economic elements of
power, we rely on the size and strength of the U.S.
economy as our ultimate line of defense. And, as
nuclear weapons reductions are negotiated, the
capability of the U.S. and allied mobilization bases
rapidly to generate additional conventional military
forces and the supplies and equipment to sustain
them, becomes increasingly important. Maintenance

 

of this capability supports deterrence and provides the
ability for a timely and flexible response to the full
range of plausible threats.

Defense industrial mobilization policies focus on steps
that industry and government can take during
peacetime and in the early stages of a crisis to acquire
long-lead time items and to prepare for surge
production. Examples of current mobilization plans
include those providing for surge production of
precision-guided munitions; for the adaptation of new
production technologies such as flexible
manufacturing systems; and for the expanded
production of machine tools.

To ensure that our industrial base can respond in an
adequate and timely fashion to a broad range of
potential emergencies, we are testing a new concept
of industrial mobilization responses linked to early
warning indicators. Under this concept, the readiness
of our industrial base would be progressively
increased as intelligence suggested an increasing
probability of hostile actions directed against U.S.
interests. To support this concept, in peacetime
planners will identify and catalog relevant industrial
base capabilities, prepare specific response options,
and create a series of graduated responses to be
implemented within existing capabilities at a time of
crisis.

Such mobilization planning cannot be done on a
purely unilateral basis. In the NATO context,
international collaboration to improve national
mobilization capabilities is important to increase
Alliance-wide efficiency and the capability to support
war plans. For example, the United States through its
representation on the NATO Industrial Planning
Committee, works closely with its allies to ensure that
member nations are prepared to support the Alliance
strategy with a coordinated and effective industrial
mobilization response.

With regard to manpower, our mobilization plans
emphasize achievable increases in defense manpower
at a pace consistent with military needs. Under
existing plans, active forces—depending on their
location—would either maintain their forward
deployment or rapidly reinforce such deployments
from the United States. Reserve forces would
mobilize, some military retirees would be recalled,
and civilian manpower would be expanded to support

21

 

such necessary defense functions as logistics, com-
munications, and health services.

Our plans for military manpower mobilization are bas-
ed upon the Total Force policy, established in the ear-
ly 1970s, which places increased responsibilities on
the reserve component of U.S. forces. With fully 50
percent of the combat units for land warfare in the
reserve components, their importance to our conven-
tional deterrent cannot be overstated. Their priority for
manning, training and equipment mobilization is
based on time-phasing of their use in operational
plans. In many cases, the sequence of deployment
would place reserve component units side by side
with, and sometimes even ahead of, the active duty
forces. While there are specific mission areas in which
the role for reserve components can be expanded, we
need to exercise care to avoid fundamentally altering
the nature of service in the reserves, or imbalance the
reserve/active force mix. While not reserves in the
conventional sense of the term, in time of war Coast
Guard forces would provide an important augmenta-
tion to our worldwide naval capabilities.

SUPPORTING POLICIES
U.S. National Space Policy

| recently approved a new national space policy
which updates and expands guidelines for the con-
duct of U.S. national security, civil, and commercial
efforts in space. The policy recognizes that a fun-
damental objective guiding U.S. activities continues to
be space leadership, which requires preeminence in
key areas critical to achieving our broad goals. These
goals include:

* Strengthening the security of the United States.

* Obtaining economic, technological and scientific
benefits that improve the quality of life on earth,
through space-related activities.

* Encouraging U.S. private sector investment in space
and space-related activities.

© Promoting international cooperative activities, taking
into account U.S. national security, foreign policy,
scientific, and economic interests.

* Cooperating with other nations in maintaining
freedom of space for activities that enhance the
security and welfare of mankind.

22

 

¢ Expanding human presence and activity beyond
Earth orbit into the solar system.

The use of space systems to satisfy many critical na-
tional security requirements is an expanding and vital
element of U.S. national power. Functions important to
our national security strategy such as communications,
navigation, environmental monitoring, early warning,
surveillance, and treaty verification are increasingly
performed by space systems. In many cases, the
worldwide access provided by the space systems
makes them the only available means for ac-
complishing these important functions. Absent the
assured use of space, our nation’s security would be
seriously jeopardized.

Our military policy for space encompasses five
elements.

First, we recognize that deterrence—at all levels of
potential conflict—cannot be accomplished without
space-based assets, so we seek to ensure that critical
space systems will be available to commanders, com-
mensurate with their need.

Second, we seek to ensure free access to space for all
nations, in a manner analogous to the way that free
access to the earth's oceans is maintained.

Third, we encourage interaction among national
security, civil government and, where appropriate,
commercial space programs to share critical
technologies and avoid unnecessary duplication of ac-
tivities.

Fourth, our policies provide for improved defensive
capabilities in the future, deterring or, if necessary,
defending against enemy attacks on our space systems.

Finally, we will continue to improve those space
systems that directly support our military forces by
enhancing their effectiveness.

Our civil space activities contribute to the nation’s
scientific, technological, and economic well-being in
addition to making a major contribution to America’s
prestige and leadership in the world. Our civil space
goals are:

© To advance scientific knowledge of the planet Earth,
the solar system, and the universe beyond.

* To preserve our preeminence in critical aspects of
space science, space applications, space technology,
and manned spaceflight.

* To open new opportunities for use of the space en-
vironment.

© To develop selected civil applications of space
technology.

© To engage in international cooperative efforts that
further U.S. space goals.

¢ To establish a permanently manned presence in
space.

U.S. leadership in civilian space programs has been
taken for granted since the late 1960s. That leadership,
however, is being increasingly challenged both by our
friends and allies abroad, and by the Soviet Union.
The ambitious program of space exploration and
research that the Soviets are pursuing, centered upon
a high level of launch capacity and the Mir Space
Station, have eroded traditional areas of U.S. space
leadership. Initiatives—such as efforts to improve our
space transportation systems, develop and deploy the
Space Station, and develop the technologies to
support a range of future solar system exploration
options—are intended to ensure U.S. preeminence in
areas critical to our national interests.

The United States is first among nations in its efforts
to foster a purely commercial, market-driven space in-
dustry without direct government subsidies. We
believe that private sector space initiatives will have
positive effects on the U.S. balance of trade, work
force skills, and the development of unique manufac-
turing methods and products. These initiatives also
promise lower costs to the taxpayer and enhanced
security to our nation. We are confident that tradi-
tional American ingenuity will yield innovative space
technology applications comparable to, or exceeding,
those achieved in aviation earlier this century.

U.S. Intelligence Policy

Development and execution of sound national security
policies, and the strategies applicable to specific situa-
tions, requires timely, accurate, and thorough informa-
tion regarding actual or potential threats to our
national security. Early warning of developments
which could place at risk U.S. interests is vital if we

 

are to employ the relevant elements of national power
in a timely way and deal with threats before they
become unmanageable, or entail the risk of conflict.
The primary goal of U.S. intelligence activities is to
provide appropriate agencies of government with the
best available information on which to base decisions
concerning the development and conduct of foreign,
economic and defense policy.

It is axiomatic that our National Security Strategy must
be strongly supported by reliable intelligence
concerning potential adversaries’ national capabilities
and probable courses of action. Intelligence also
provides essential insights into how we are viewed by
those adversaries. Their perceptions of our capabilities,
political will, national interests, and likely reaction to
hostile provocation, provide an important measure of
the effectiveness of our strategy. The collection of such
information is a priority objective of our intelligence
activities. It must be pursued in a vigorous, innovative,
and responsible manner that is consistent with
applicable law and respectful of the principles upon
which this nation was founded.

The capability to deal with the hostile intelligence
threat to the United States is equally important. The
large and active intelligence services of the Soviet
Union, its clients and surrogates, conduct
sophisticated collection and analysis operations
targeted against us, our allies, and friends. The Soviets
rely heavily on espionage and an elaborate apparatus
for illegal acquisition of Western military technology
to further their strategic aims. The apprehension over
the past few years of spies conducting highly damag-
ing espionage operations against the United States has
dramatically underlined the severity of the threat. |
have directed that the U.S. intelligence community
give special emphasis to detecting and countering es-
pionage and other threats from foreign intelligence
services.

International terrorism and narcotics trafficking, par-
ticularly when state-supported, can threaten the
security of the U.S. and our citizens. Intelligence
plays a critical role in our efforts to control and
reduce these threats. Intelligence collection and
special operations by agencies of the U.S. government
to protect against international terrorism and interna-
tional narcotics activities will remain a high priority.

23

 

The ability to conduct covert action operations is an
essential element of our national security capability.
In selected circumstances such operations provide a
means to deal with developing threats to our security
before the employment of U.S. military power or
other actions entailing higher costs and risks are re-
quired. Over the past year, we have reviewed all ex-
isting covert action programs to ensure that they are
in accordance with applicable law and consistent with
U.S. policy. We have also put into place procedures
for approval, review and congressional notification of

24

new covert action operations to ensure that such
operations receive appropriate interagency review, and
are consistent with applicable law. Additionally, we
have instituted stricter accountability of access to
protect confidentiality, and have established “sunset
provisions” that require annual review of all covert
action programs, and their continuation only by
Presidential approval. We will continue to employ
such covert action operations in support of national
security objectives, and ensure that they are con-
sistently supportive of national policy.

 

IV. Integrating Elements of Power
into National Security Strategy

STRATEGY FOR THE
WESTERN HEMISPHERE

Our own territorial security is inextricably linked with
the security of our hemispheric neighbors, north and
south; the defense of North America is the nation’s
most fundamental security concern. We sometimes fail
fully to appreciate the great strategic importance of
the Latin American and Caribbean regions, in spite of
their proximity to our borders and importance to our
national security. The significance of these regions has
not been lost to Soviet planners, however, who refer to
Latin America and the Caribbean as our “strategic
rear’ The USSR has, since the early 1960s,
increasingly sought to expand its influence in these
areas to the detriment of our own security. Our
national interests, as well as our political principles,
have led us to promote democracy and economic
progress throughout the hemisphere. In the past, we
have relied on a hemispheric security system
composed of a strong U.S. deterrent, broadly-based
cooperation with Canada, and collective security
arrangements with Latin America. More recently we
have built on this foundation a policy aimed at
strengthening the ability of our Central American and
Caribbean neighbors to resist outside aggression and
subversion, and facilitating the transition to democracy
in the region. Today 28 of 33 countries in Latin
America and the Caribbean, with over 90 percent of
the population, are democratic. As we work for further
consolidation of democracy, we continue to promote
economic cooperation with our Hemispheric
neighbors.

We remain deeply committed to the interdependent,
regional objectives of democracy and freedom, peace,

 

 

and economic progress. To achieve these, we must
counter the threat of Soviet expansionist policies not
only from Cuba, but now from Nicaragua. Critical
national security interests in Latin America are based
on long-standing U.S. policy that there be no Soviet,
Cuban, or other Communist bloc beachhead on the
mainland of the Western Hemisphere, or any country
that upsets the regional balance and poses a serious
military threat to its neighbors. Representative
democracy in Nicaragua is a key goal in our strategy
to achieve lasting peace and our other interdependent
security objectives for the hemisphere.

We support the Guatemala Peace Accords and
welcome the initial steps taken by the Sandinistas in
the direction of a freer, more democratic and
pluralistic Nicaragua, as agreed to in the Accords. Yet
we have reason to remain skeptical. It is too soon to
tell if the Sandinista leaders will comply with the
pledges they have made. The Sandinistas have made
similar promises in the past—including in 1979 to the
Organization of American States—which were broken.
It is important to keep in mind, however, that even if
the Nicaraguan government should live up to its
obligations under the Guatemala Peace Accords in full
and credible fashion, security concerns affecting
important U.S. interests would remain. They include
the Soviet and Cuban military presence in Nicaragua,
and the rapid growth of the Nicaraguan military
capability which threatens the military balance of the
region as well as Nicaragua's democratic neighbors.

To encourage the Sandinistas to implement the agreed
reforms in good faith, and to advance U.S. security
interests in Central America, we have engaged in
extensive and close consultation with the Central
America democracies and the Nicaraguan Resistance.
One key element of our diplomatic strategy is the

25

pressure exerted on the Sandinista regime by the Nic-
araguan Resistance. We will continue funding the Re-
sistance until we see evidence that democratization in
Nicaragua is real and irreversible. Accordingly, the
Administration will request renewed assistance for the
Freedom Fighters early this year. Economic and trade
sanctions are other key elements of our coordinated
strategy.

Currently we are deeply involved in the struggle
throughout Latin America against the menace of drug
production and trafficking, which pose threats not
only to the integrity and stability of governments to
our South, but to the social fabric of the United States
itself. Working bilaterally, and wherever possible on a
regional basis, we are supplying resources and
expertise to the governments wishing to engage with
us in this priority effort.

Increased trade among the Western Hemisphere
countries is also an important element of our national
security strategy. Such trade will aid debtor countries
in the region in managing their obligations in a
responsible manner while contributing to their
economic growth. In addition, the United States
supports providing additional resources for the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to
assist these countries in adjusting to the consequences
of external economic forces, such as the decline of
world oil and other commodity prices.

Our close relationship with Canada derives from our
long historical and cultural association, as well as
geopolitical and economic factors—our physical
proximity, the openness of our more than 3,000 mile
border, and our important military cooperation, both
bilaterally and under the NATO aegis. Economically,
Canada is by far our largest trading partner. Our
primary objective with respect to Canada, a close
friend and ally, is to protect and strengthen the
already excellent relations we enjoy. In the near-term,
our goal can be best achieved by securing approval by
the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament of the
recently negotiated United States-Canada Free Trade
Area agreement. This agreement will benefit both
countries by removing tariff and non-tariff barriers to
trade in goods and services and by facilitating cross-
border investment by the private sectors of both
countries.

STRATEGY FOR THE SOVIET
UNION AND EASTERN
EUROPE

As mentioned earlier, the most significant threat to
U.S. national interests remains that posed by the So-
viet Union. Despite some improvement in U.S.-Soviet
relations over the past year, the long-term threat has
not perceptibly diminished.

The differences between the United States and the
Soviet Union are fundamental in nature, given the
great disparities in our political, economic and social
systems, and our divergent geostrategic interests.
While the much-publicized reforms of the new Soviet
leadership have raised expectations of more benign
Soviet policies, there is as yet no evidence that the
Soviets have abandoned their long-term objectives.
This means that U.S. strategy to counter these
objectives must also remain consistent and aimed at
the long-term. We must remain sufficiently flexible to
seize the initiative and explore positive shifts in Soviet
policy which may strengthen U.S. security; but we
must not delude ourselves into believing that the
Soviet threat has yet been fundamentally altered, or
that our vigilance can be reduced.

Consistent with this approach, our overall strategy to-
ward the Soviet Union remains to contain Soviet
expansionism, and to encourage political democracy
and basic human rights within the Soviet Union and
the countries under its hegemony. These have been
the national security objectives of successive U.S.
administrations, though the manner of their
implementation has varied. Continued emphasis on
the principles of strength, dialogue and realism in our
strategy may eventually alter Soviet behavior in
fundamental ways to create a more stable and
peaceful world.

The maintenance of adequate strength to deter Soviet
aggression anywhere in the world that our strategic
interests require is central to our strategy. Such
strength must encompass not only military power, but
also the political determination, vitality of alliances
and the economic health essential to meet our global
responsibilities. In areas where the Soviets are
currently engaged in military expansionism, such as
Afghanistan, the United States is demonstrating its

willingness to support local resistance forces to the
degree necessary to frustrate Soviet ambitions. In
general, our goals are to convince the Soviet Union
that the use of military force does not pay, and that
the build-up of military forces beyond levels necessary
for legitimate national defense will not provide
unilateral advantage.

National strength must be complemented by
constructive dialogue. We have established a four part
agenda for discussion with the Soviet Union: arms
reduction, human rights, resolution of regional
conflicts, and bilateral exchanges. We have made clear
that substantial progress in all areas is necessary to
allow a truly qualitative improvement of U.S.Soviet
relations. Our emphasis on human rights is directly
relevant to our security strategy because we believe
that the manner in which a government treats its own
people reflects upon its behavior in the international
community of nations.

Although progress in U.S-Soviet relations has
historically been difficult to predict, present
indications are that the Soviet leadership recognizes
that some of the country’s past policies must be
altered to prevent further domestic economic and
technological obsolescence. In this regard, the policies
of the current leadership have a marked strategic cast
to them, to the extent that they aim at placing the
Soviets in a more competitive position vis-a-vis the
United States over the long term. At the same time,
should the Soviets demonstrate that they genuinely
wish to improve the U.S-Soviet relationship by
reducing military expenditures and force structure, by
terminating Third World subversion and expansion,
and by focusing on their internal problems, they will
find the United States welcoming their more
responsible behavior on the international scene.

While acknowledging that most of the countries of
Eastern Europe are members of the Warsaw Pact, we
have never recognized Soviet hegemony in the region
as legitimate or healthy because it is based on
military power and dictatorship, not democratic
consent. We wish to develop our relations with each
country of the region on an individual basis. Many
East European countries at present face severe
economic difficulties as a result of forced emulation of
Soviet economic models. The populations of these
countries are significantly pro-Western in outlook and
would like to strengthen ties with the Western

 

 

 

community of nations. At the same time, the
economic utility of Eastern Europe to the Soviet Union
is declining.

These factors combine to give the United States an
opportunity to improve its relations with Eastern
European countries, Our objectives in the region are
to encourage liberalization and more autonomous
foreign policies, and to foster genuine, long-term
human rights improvements. Our strategy is to
differentiate our policies toward these countries
according to their conduct, and to develop relations
with each based on individual merit.

The United States and its NATO Allies also are
working jointly to overcome the artificial division of
Europe which occurred after World War II and to
promote closer ties between Eastern and Western
Europe. This takes place primarily through the
35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which serves to maintain pressure on the So-
viet Union and Eastern European governments to
improve human rights performance and increases
contact and communication between East and West.

STRATEGY FOR WESTERN
EUROPE AND NATO

The security of Western Europe is a vital component
of U.S. National Security Strategy. We share a
common heritage and democratic values with Western
European countries, have a compelling mutual interest
in containing Soviet expansion, and benefit from
interdependent economic relations.

Overall, our objectives in Western Europe are to help
maintain the region's security and independence from
Soviet intimidation, to promote its political and
economic health, to consult with European
governments on effective policies toward the Soviet
Union and the Warsaw Pact, and to work with West-
ern Europeans toward overcoming the East-West
division of the European continent.

The North Atlantic Alliance embodies the U.S.
commitment to Western Europe as well as the
members’ commitment to defend each other. NATO
has preserved peace in Europe for almost 40 years, by

27

 

far the longest period of peace on the continent in
this century. Through the Alliance, NATO members
engage in collective defense to deter Soviet aggression
and enhance security. NATO is, however, both a
political and military entity. Through NATO, the
United States also consults with its Western European
Allies on a wide range of issues.

The cohesion and unity of NATO are essential to a
successful security strategy relative to the Soviet
Union. The repeated and unsuccessful Soviet efforts to
drive wedges between the United States and Western
Europe testify to the strength of Alliance unity. These
Soviet efforts have been thwarted through close and
frequent high-level consultations among allies, to
maintain our solidarity and our common strategy on
crucial issues. The most recent success story of the
Alliance has been the conclusion of an Intermediate-
Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty between the United
States and the Soviet Union. This agreement
vindicates NATO's 1979 dual-track decision which,
through commitment both to negotiate and to deploy
intermediate-range nuclear forces, gave the Soviet
Union incentive eventually to agree to the total
elimination of this category of weapons. The cohesion
of the Alliance and the courage of Allied governments
which deployed INF missiles despite sometimes
significant domestic resistance has paid off, and
resulted in the first agreement in history which will
actually reduce nuclear arsenals.

The United States, working closely with NATO allies,
hopes to reach other successful arms agreements with
the Soviet Union; but we have made clear that the
strategy of flexible response will require the
continuing presence of U.S. nuclear weapons, and
strong conventional forces, in Europe. This is
particularly true in view of the great disparity in
conventional forces on the continent which directly
threatens Western Europe. The pronounced
conventional force imbalance has been a matter of
concern for many years. In 1985, the Alliance adopted
an ambitious plan of action designed to remedy
NATO's most critical conventional deficiencies.
Progress in some areas—such as the provision of
aircraft shelters and the filling of critical munition
shortfalls—has been encouraging, but much more
remains to be accomplished. Within the context of
these ongoing efforts, the United States will work in
close consultation with our allies toward:

28

 

* Maintenance of the credibility of NATO's nuclear
deterrent. We will work toward full implementation
of the Montebello agreement, including the
provisions on nuclear modernization, as well as
some restructuring of NATO’s nuclear forces.

* Maintenance of a credible conventional deterrent
with emphasis on further execution of Alliance
approved conventional defense improvements,
including provisions for air defense and increased
sustainability stocks.

* More effective use of resources available for
deterrent capabilities through national defense
budgets. We are just beginning to realize a return
on initial efforts in armaments cooperation, and will
work closely with our allies to bring to fruition
other programs recently initiated with
Congressionally reserved funds for cooperative re-
search and development. We will also continue to
search for new opportunities to enhance
conventional defense capabilities in resource-
effective ways, such as improved crisis management
procedures and rationalization of roles and missions
with our allies.

¢ Improvement of the military use of technology,
while strengthening NATO's industrial base,
particularly in some countries on NATO's southern
flank.

Narrowing the gap in conventional capabilities can
enhance deterrence, raise the nuclear threshold and
reduce the risk of Soviet miscalculation. It also offers
the best hope of inducing the Soviets to negotiate
seriously toward a stable conventional equilibrium at
lower force levels.

NATO also provides a forum for Western consultation
on such political processes as the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), where
our goal is to ensure full Soviet and Eastern European
implementation of the commitments undertaken in the
Helsinki Final Act and Madrid Concluding Document.
Of special interest are the CSCE provisions on human
rights and the freer flow of peoples and information
across the East-West divide. CSCE represents a crucial
means by which the United States and its Allies are
working to reduce the repression and the artificial
barriers which have existed since the Soviet Union
imposed its will on neighboring countries after World
War II.

Although the NATO Alliance remains strong and
vigorous, aspects of our relationship with Western
Europe transcend NATO concerns. These include
issues such as trade and protectionism, methods of
dealing with terrorism, and policy toward regions
outside of the NATO geographic area. We seek to
work closely with Western European governments on
these matters, though there are sometimes differing
viewpoints as is natural among sovereign, democratic
governments.

STRATEGY FOR THE MIDDLE
EAST AND SOUTH ASIA

Despite the multitude of changes in the Middle East
over the past several decades, U.S. objectives have
held remarkably constant. In harmony with the pre-
dominant aspiration of the peoples of the region, we
remain deeply committed to helping forge a just and
lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors. Our
regional goals also include limiting Soviet influence,
fostering the security and prosperity of Israel and our
Arab friends, and curbing state-sponsored terrorism. To
achieve these aims, we must hurdle some serious
obstacles including continuing, deep-seated Arab-
Israeli tensions, the emotionally-charged Palestinian
problem, radical anti-Western political and religious
movements, the use of terrorism as an instrument of
state policy, and Soviet policies which have supported
the forces of extremism rather than the forces of
moderation.

In working to overcome these obstacles we pursue a
strategy which integrates diplomatic, economic and
military instruments. With regard to the Arab-Israeli
peace process, the U.S. initiative of September 1, 1982
remains the cornerstone of our approach. While
working diplomatically to narrow the gap and make
direct negotiations possible, we also provide military
and economic assistance to our friends in the region
to bolster their security in the face of continuing
threats. Moderate regimes must be secure if they are
to run the risks of making peace. At the same time,
we remain willing to confront and build international
pressure against those states, such as Libya and Iran,
which sponsor terrorism and promote subversion
against friendly governments.

 

 

In the Persian Gulf region, we also pursue an
integrated approach to secure our four longstanding
objectives: maintaining freedom of navigation;
strengthening the moderate Arab states; reducing the
influence of anti-Western powers, such as the Soviet
Union and Iran; and assuring access to oil on
reasonable terms for ourselves and our allies. |ran’s
continuation and escalation of the Iran-Iraq War,
including its attempts to intimidate non-belligerent
Gulf Arab states, pose the most serious, immediate
threat to our interests, and provide the Soviet Union
the opportunity to advance its regional agenda.

In responding to these threats diplomatically we work
persistently to end the war, both unilaterally—as with
Operation Stanch, to cease the flow of war materiel to
lran—and through multilateral forums, such as the
United Nations Security Council. The current chal-
lenge is to get Iran to join Iraq in accepting a
comprehensive settlement.

Since 1949, our diplomatic commitment to regional
stability and undisrupted commerce has been
supported by our military policy of maintaining a
permanent naval presence in the Persian Gulf. That
presence is currently expanded to allow us to deter
lranian attempts to intimidate moderate states in the
region, and to play our traditional role of protecting _
U.S-flag shipping in the face of increased Iranian
aggressiveness. Five other NATO governments have
also made decisions to deploy naval vessels to the
Gulf where they assist in protecting freedom of
navigation. A prudent but responsive policy of arms
sales for the self-defense of our friends in the region is
also an integral part of our strategy, as those nations
assume greater responsibility for their own defense.

In South Asia, we aim to reduce regional tensions,
especially those between India and Pakistan; to restore
freedom in Afghanistan; to promote democratic
political institutions and economic development; to
end narcotics production and trafficking; and to
discourage nuclear proliferation. These objectives are
threatened primarily by the Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan, the continuing antagonism between India
and Pakistan, and the refusal of those two states to re-
strain sensitive aspects of their nuclear programs.

In dealing with the problem of nuclear proliferation in
South Asia, we have followed a two-track approach.

29

= SES. Se

First, we have made clear to the government of Paki-
stan that our provision of security assistance requires
Pakistani nuclear restraint. At the same time, provision
of U.S. military and economic assistance helps Paki-
stan meet legitimate security needs without resorting
to the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Secondly,
recognizing that there is a regional context for the
Pakistani nuclear program, we have encouraged India
and Pakistan toward an agreement on confidence
building measures. We are encouraged that the
leadership in both countries is actively looking for
ways to improve their relations with each other.

We remain unequivocally opposed to the Soviet
military presence in Afghanistan. In the absence of a
political settlement which provides for a prompt and
complete withdrawal of Soviet troops, restoration of
Afghanistan to its independent non-aligned status, and
self-determination for the Afghan people, we will
continue our firm support for the Afghan cause. We
also work to bolster the security of Pakistan, the
frontline state hosting nearly three million Afghan
refugees, with a second six-year assistance plan. By
expanding our ties with India as well as Pakistan, we
hope to foster stability in South Asia. Recent advances
in technological and scientific cooperation between
the United States and India, in both civilian and
military areas, with prospects for further growth, have
been important in improving relations between our
two countries. We also provide development assistance
throughout the region and support the work of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation to
promote stability by fostering regional economic
growth.

The sharp reduction in U:S. economic and military
assistance funding, plus Congressional opposition to
the sale of modern defense weapons to a number of
states, has had a negative impact on U.S. security
interests in both the Middle East and South Asia.
These cutbacks in security assistance have been all the
more damaging because threats to friendly states have
increased their need for security assistance and
weapons. At the same time, the Soviet Union has
become more aggressive in offering weapons to
countries unable to obtain them from the United
States. The Soviets have also become more active in
using economic instruments such as debt rescheduling
to enhance their own political influence.

30

 

STRATEGY FOR EAST ASIA
AND THE PACIFIC

As a Pacific power the United States faces formidable
challenges in projecting its strength across that broad
region. Our security objectives, as elsewhere, are
aimed at helping our allies and friends in the region
to develop economically and politically as they defend
themselves from encroachment. We are meeting with
success in most areas. The free nations of East Asia
and the Pacific now lead the world in demonstrating
an economic and political dynamism that stands in
stark contrast with conditions in other nations in the
regions such as Vietnam and North Korea. Our Asian
allies and friends also stood together with us in the
years of effort required to achieve the INF Treaty,
which removes a threat from Asia, as well as from
Western Europe.

Soviet military power in Asia and the Pacific continues
its steady qualitative improvement, but the U.S.
response is not confined to technical issues of relative
military strength. Our basic aims are to strengthen the
natural political and economic ties that link us with
regional states, to evoke greater participation by our
allies and friends in their own defense, and to
proceed steadily with necessary modernization of our
military forces deployed to the area.

Cooperation with Japan remains basic to U.S.
relationships in the region. The United States-Japan
Treaty of Cooperation and Security formalizes our
defense ties, providing a security foundation for the
broad spectrum of economic and political associations
which uniquely join us.

During the past ten years, a consensus has emerged in
Japan that Japan should undertake the primary
responsibility to defend its homeland, territorial seas
and skies, and its sea lanes out to 1,000 nautical
miles. In 1985 the government of Japan incorporated
that concept into its current Five Year Defense Plan.
Japan's defense spending has increased more than five
percent per year in real terms for the past five years,
and we have encouraged Japan to continue
modernizing its forces in order to carry out its
legitimate defense responsibilities. In addition to
providing for its own defense forces, Japan contributes
over $2 billion per year to support U.S. forces
stationed in Japan.

The economic dimension of our relationship with
Japan, as well as with other key nations in the region,
is sO prominent that it must be considered an integral
part of our national security strategy. The massive
trade surplus of Japan with the United States is
unsustainable and a source of political tension, as are
the lesser surpluses of other regional nations. Such
economic imbalances must be reduced through a
combination of measures including support for U.S.
initiatives for multilateral trade liberalization in the
GATT.

In view of the globalization of financial markets,
cooperation with Japan on economic policy will be
key to maintaining confidence on world stock and
currency markets. A recent positive development is Ja-
pan’s significantly increased expenditures on foreign
assistance. Japan continues to target assistance on
countries of strategic importance, and is giving more
of its aid in “untied” form than in the past.

Our alliance with the Republic of Korea remains vital
to regional stability. North Korea maintains forces that
far exceed those of the South in quantity, are
continuously strengthened by additional Soviet
weapons, and are in the hands of a government
whose aggressive demeanor and tendency to act
unexpectedly are well known. Our military presence
in the Republic of Korea underpins regional stability
and builds confidence, which is essential to that
country’s remarkable economic development and
political evolution. Sound security, politics, and
economics are indivisible. In this process, the United
States has used its influence to encourage Koreans to-
ward democratic change. We have done so, however,
with respect for Korean traditions and political
realities; and we are mindful of the constant security
threat. The Republic of Korea is our seventh largest
trading partner; significant market and investment
opportunities for U.S. firms exist. Market access
barriers are coming down, but not fast enough, and
much more remains to be done.

Both the People’s Republic of China and the United
States have cultivated good relations based on realistic
calculations of each country's best interests. For our
part, we continue to believe that a strong, secure, and
modernizing China is in our interest. Although our
economic, social, and political systems differ, we share
a common perception of the requirement for stability
in the region and for resistance to expansionism. On

 

this basis, we have continued to increase our trade,
people-to-people contacts, and even limited, defensive
military cooperation. Differences persist over some
issues, but we have continued to develop a mature
relationship that clearly benefits both countries.

Through assiduous management of the United States-
China relationship, we expect to cooperate when our
interests and China's are parallel, such as in
Afghanistan, and in maintaining stability in East Asia.
We are confident a level-headed national consensus
on how to conduct relations with China will remain
the foundation for additional growth and interaction in
the relationship.

The Philippine government has made progress
restoring democracy and laying the foundation for
economic growth. The Aquino government, however,
continues to face major political, security and
economic challenges. Through all of the tools
available to us, we are determined to help this
important Pacific ally to overcome these problems so
it can sustain economic growth, counter the threat of
a virulent internal communist insurgency, and
strengthen democratic government.

Thailand, another Association of Southeast Nations
(ASEAN) member, and our treaty ally, borders
Cambodia, which is now occupied by the Vietnamese
and the site of an active Cambodian resistance effort
struggling to regain self-determination for the Khmer
people. In support of Thailand, which also shoulders
the major refugee burden in Southeast Asia, we will
continue our close security cooperation to deter any
potential aggression and maintain our support of
eligible refugees. We will also continue our
cooperative effort with Thailand to suppress narcotic
trafficking.

We view the continued occupation of Cambodia by
Vietnamese forces as an unacceptable violation of
international law that undermines regional efforts to-
wards development, peace and stability. We also
oppose the return of the Khmer Rouge to power in
Cambodia. We will continue our strong endorsement
of ASEAN’s quest for a political solution and support
for the non-Communist elements of the Cambodian
resistance coalition. Under our initiative on regional
problems at the United Nations, we are prepared to
play a constructive role in efforts to achieve a

31

 

Cambodian settlement. In the context of a settlement
involving the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops, we are prepared to enter into normalization
talks with Vietnam.

Despite our serious differences with Vietnam, through
bilateral discussions we have achieved progress in
accounting for our missing servicemen, and in release
of reeducation internees and Amerasians. We have
also seen a modest but welcome improvement in
relations between Laos and the United States. Our pri-
mary measure of Laotian sincerity in improving
relations with the U.S. is accelerated efforts to account
for our servicemen still missing.

As Australia enters its bicentennial year, close bilateral
bonds and security relationships continue to be the
keystone of our policy in the region. But regrettably,
New Zealand has now written into law the policies
that caused us to suspend our ANZUS Treaty
obligations to Wellington. This has dimmed the pros-
pect of New Zealand’s resuming its place in the
Alliance.

The South Pacific more broadly is passing through a
generational change and the stresses of economic and
demographic shifts. The island nations of the South
Pacific have joined the legion of commodity-exporting
countries whose efforts to develop a stable economic
base have been undermined by persistently low world
commodity prices. At the same time, the positive
effects of improved health care have produced rapid
increases in population. Memories of U.S. cooperation
with the islanders during World War II are *mming.
Resource constraints have prevented us from assisting
as much as we would wish, but we expect Congress
to approve expeditiously authorization for $10 million
annually over the 5-year life of the new fisheries treaty
with the region's islands states. This should help offset
some of the irritants that have troubled our traditional
good relations in the region and have invited Soviet
probes.

In Fiji this past year, we have sorrowfully witnessed a
prolonged struggle within that nation’s ethnic
communities over their future. We remain committed
to encouraging a broadly based resolution of Fiji’s
political troubles.

The decision of the people of Palau last year to
accede to the Compact of Free Association lays the

32

 

foundation for creation of a third freely associated
state and for closing our U.N. trusteeship in the
Pacific Islands. This act of self-determination promotes
our belief in stability through democracy; and the
Compact of Free Association helps accomplish our
goal of preventing these Pacific states from becoming
caught up in superpower rivalry.

Soviet interest in East Asia and the Pacific remains on
the upswing, however, as Moscow's increasingly
skillful propagandists seek to erode the concept of
deterrence and promote seemingly benign
disarmament schemes. The United States and the
people of the region naturally seek a reduction of
tensions. But this should begin at the real points of
tension—North Korea and Vietnamese-occupied
Cambodia, for example. We will not be lured into
proposals designed to weaken relations with our allies
or unilaterally impair our ability to protect U.S.
interests in East Asia and the Pacific region.

STRATEGY FOR AFRICA

The diversity of Africa embodies a broad range of
national security interests and presents numerous
challenges for the United States. We maintain military
access or U.S. facilities in several countries in support
of our strategic interests in the region and beyond
(such as in Southwest Asia and the Persian Gulf).
Africa is an important source of strategic minerals and
a potential growth market for U.S. exports. Its shores
adjoin some of the most important international sea
lanes. It represents a significant voting group in the
United Nations and other international organizations.

A number of domestic and external pressures pose
threats to our interests in African security. The Soviet
Union and its surrogates have made the Horn of
Africa an arena for EastWest competition. They have
sustained a costly civil war in Angola which has
shattered the country’s economy and seriously
degraded the quality of life for innocent civilians. The
Soviet Union has viewed southern Africa as an
opportune area for its expansionist policies. And it has
been the preeminent military supplier for Libya's
Muammar Qaddhafi, whose southward aggression
threatens Chad and other sub-Saharan African
countries. Apartheid will not only continue to breed

conflict within South Africa, but is a primary cause of
instability in all of southern Africa.

Perhaps as in no other region, economic concerns are
closely interrelated with political stability in Africa.
After more than two decades of misguided statist
policies which produced economic deterioration,
many African countries are now recognizing that
market-oriented economic reform is critical for
renewed growth and development. Public reaction to
the stringent reforms which are now needed will pose
another kind of threat to political stability, at least in
the near term. Moreover, Africa's heavy debt burden
has stymied the abilities of governments to move
beyond economic reform to economic growth.

An effective U.S. strategy toward Africa integrates
political, military, and economic elements. We must
continue to sustain relationships with our military
partners and support regimes threatened by Soviet and
Libyan aspirations. We will work for national
reconciliation and the peaceful resolution of conflicts
in Angola, Namibia, and elsewhere. We will continue
to promote peaceful progress toward non-racial
representative democracy in South Africa, and peace
between South Africa and its neighbors. We support
regional economic cooperation among the countries
of southern Africa and will assist collaborative efforts
to achieve economic development. We must
encourage governments to stay the politically risky
course of economic reform.

In a region as underdeveloped as Africa, which has
relatively little access to private sources of capital, our
ability to achieve our objectives depends in very
significant measure on effective economic and security
assistance programs. Too often security assistance is
portrayed as a tradeoff against support for
development. In Africa, this distinction is particularly
ill-founded. Our security assistance programs promote
a stable political and economic environment that
permits the exercise of individual choice and the
development of human talent. Without that
environment, sustained development is not possible.

U.S. military assistance programs in Africa have always
been modest, but recéntly funding has been almost
eliminated by Congress. It is in our national interest to
provide a reasonable level of support to moderate,
friendly countries such as Kenya and Zaire, to regimes
on the front lines of Soviet-supported aggression such

 

 

as Somalia, and to countries facilitating access in
support of our strategies in Southwest Asia and the
Persian Gulf.

U.S. military training programs are an invaluable
instrument for promoting professionalism and respect
for human rights. The exposure to Western values that
comes from such programs may foster a respect for
the United States and democratic institutions among
individuals who play a key role in determining the
level of freedom and stability in African countries.
Many of these programs also contribute to economic
security. The African Coastal Security Program, for
example, provides training to West African countries to
enable them to protect their coastal fish stocks from
unauthorized foreign fishing fleets.

The U.S. assistance program in South Africa for
victims of apartheid, enacted into law by Congress,
helps prepare disenfranchised citizens for participation
in constitutional democracy and a free enterprise
economy in post-apartheid South Africa. Our new
program for regional trade and transport development
in the southern African states furthers our mutual
political interests and enables these countries to
develop alternatives to total dependence on South
Africa.

As African countries struggle to liberalize and expand
their economies, market economics are on trial. Our
challenge is to be able to provide enough resources to
permit new economic policies to bear fruit and
enable African countries to become fully integrated
into the existing world trading and financial system. A
promising start has been made with the President's
Initiative to End Hunger in Africa, the African
Economic Policy Reform Program, the Baker Plan
providing assistance on debt, and the Food for
Progress program. We must ensure that our assistance
programs and those of other donor countries and
institutions give impetus to further progress.

As part of that effort, we will continue to work with
our Western and Japanese partners to find creative
solutions to the debt problem of countries
implementing reforms. Our budgetary restrictions limit
what we can do directly, but much is at stake. Al-
though the aggregate debt is small compared to that
of Latin America, it has prevented the growth benefits
of economic reform from being realized.

33

STRATEGY FOR LOW
INTENSITY CONFLICT

While high intensity conflict has been successfully
deterred in most regions of primary strategic interest
to the United States, low intensity conflicts continue
to pose a variety of threats to the achievement of
important U.S. objectives. As described in last year’s
report, low intensity conflict typically manifests itself
as political-military confrontation below the level of
conventional war, frequently involving protracted
struggles of competing principles and ideologies, and
ranging from subversion to the direct use of military
force. These conflicts, generally in the Third World,
can have both regional and global implications for our
national security interests. For example:

© Military basing, access and transit rights in the
Philippines, key to U.S. power projection
capabilities in the Western Pacific and Indian
Oceans, are presently threatened by the communist
insurgency being waged against the Philippine
Government.

© In mineral-rich southern Africa, insurgencies,
economic instability and apartheid, as well as
ethnic tribal conflicts, pose potential threats to the
extraction of essential raw materials and their export
to industries in the West and Japan. The conflicts
endemic to the region are exacerbated by the
activity of the Soviet Union and its surrogates.

© Soviet, Cuban and Nicaraguan support for
insurgencies in El Salvador and elsewhere in Latin
America threaten nascent democracies in the region
which are already struggling with chronic poverty,
economic underdevelopment, and the growing
influence of narcotics cartels.

¢ Libya has used the threat of restricting or denying
oil shipments to blunt West European response to
state-sponsored terrorism, while simultaneously
training terrorists on Libyan soil. Freedom of action
for some U.S. allies can be limited by economic
ties.

Our strategies for dealing with low intensity conflict
recognize that U.S. responses in such situations must
be realistic, often discreet, and founded on a clear
relationship between the conflicts outcome and

34

 

important U.S. national security interests. Many low
intensity conflicts have no direct relevance to those
interests, while others may affect them in the most
fundamental ways. When a U.S. response is called for,
we take care to ensure that it is developed in
accordance with the principles of international and
domestic law, which affirm the inherent right of states
to use force in individual or collective self-defense
against armed attack; and to assist one another in
maintaining internal order against insurgency,
terrorism, illicit narcotics traffic, and other
characteristic forms of low intensity conflict.

Consistent with our strategies for dealing with low
intensity conflict, when it is in U.S. interest to do so,
the United States will:

© Work to ameliorate the underlying causes of
conflict in the Third World by promoting economic
development and the growth of democratic political
institutions.

© Support selected resistance movements opposing
oppressive regimes working against U.S. interests.
Such support will be coordinated with friends and
allies.

* Take measures to strengthen friendly nations facing
internal or external threats to their independence
and stability by employing appropriate instruments
of U.S. power. Where possible, action will be taken
early—before instability leads to widespread
violence; and emphasis will be placed on those
measures which strengthen the threatened regime's
long-term capability to deal with threats to its
freedom and stability.

¢ Take steps to discourage Soviet and other state-
sponsored adventurism, and increase the costs to
those who use proxies or terrorist and subversive
forces to exploit instability.

¢ Assist other countries in the interdiction and
eradication of illicit narcotics production and traffic.
Measures which have proven particularly effective
include aid to expand and improve the affected
country’s law enforcement capabilities, to preserve
the independence and integrity of its judicial
system, and to provide for the sharing of
intelligence and investigative capabilities.

Our own military forces have demonstrated
capabilities to engage in low intensity conflict, and
these capabilities have improved substantially in the
last several years. But the most appropriate application
of U.S. military power is usually indirect through
security assistance—training, advisory help, logistics
support, and the supply of essential military
equipment. Recipients of such assistance bear the pri-
mary responsibility for promoting their own security
interests with the U.S. aid provided. Our program of
assistance to El Salvador illustrates a successful
indirect application of U.S. military power.

The balanced application of the various elements of
national power is necessary to protect U.S. interests in

 

low intensity conflicts. But in the final analysis, the
tools we have at our disposal are of little use without
the support of the American people, and their
willingness to stay the course in what can be
protracted struggles. We cannot prevail if there is a
sharp asymmetry of wills—if our adversaries’
determination is greater than our own. At the same
time we do hold important advantages. We represent a
model of political and economic development that
promises freedom from political oppression and
economic privation. If we can protect our own
security, and maintain an environment of reasonable
stability and open trade and communication
throughout the Third World, political, economic, and
social forces should eventually work to our advantage.

35

V. Executing the Strategy

The legislation requiring this annual report wisely
emphasized the importance of discussing not only
what our strategy is, but how well it is supported, and
whether any significant impediments to its execution
exist. In a sense, this portion of the report is the most
: important, for it brings into focus the fundamental
issue of whether our strategy and resources are in bal-
ance; and, if they are not, whether we should resolve
the imbalance by changing the strategy, by supporting
it more effectively, or by consciously accepting a
higher level of risk to our national security interests.

The following paragraphs will discuss U.S. capabilities
to execute the National Security Strategy presented in
preceding chapters, with particular attention to those
areas where resource shortfalls adversely affect our
ability to execute the strategy in efficient and effective
ways.

RESOURCE SUPPORT

The successful execution of any strategy depends
upon the availability of adequate resources. This
means that we must not adopt strategies that our
country cannot afford; and our diplomats and military
leaders must not base their plans on resources that are
beyond the nation’s capability to provide. It also
means that Congress, operating from a shared view of
U.S. national security interests and objectives, must
provide the Executive with the resources necessary to
implement a realistic, prudent, and effective National
Security Strategy. Recently, however, the Congressional
response has been inadequate.

For example, U.S. foreign assistance, including a
balanced mix of military and economic assistance,
promotes important national interests and helps

 

 

 

communicate our values and principles throughout
the world. These programs convert our regional
strategies into positive, visible actions which provide
assistance to people facing severe economic privation,
and promote the economic and political development
so important to help struggling societies evolve in
constructive ways. They also help governments seeking
to defend themselves from internal and external
threats. By helping our friends enhance their security,
we aid in creating the necessary preconditions for
economic and political development. In short, our
foreign assistance programs support the types of
positive change that will protect our national interests
over the long-term.

We currently spend less than two percent of our
annual federal budget on foreign assistance. This is
indisputably money well spent. The good we do, the
problems we help solve, and the threats we counter
through our assistance programs far outweigh the
costs. They represent a highly leveraged investment,
with large payoffs for relatively small outlays.
Nevertheless, our foreign assistance programs do not
receive the support they deserve from the Congress or
from the American people. In the last few years, the
Administration's foreign assistance budget requests
have been severely cut by the Congress. Although all
programs must bear the burden of reducing the
budget deficit, the cuts in foreign assistance have often
been grossly disproportionate. While the federal
budget has been growing overall, foreign assistance
was reduced by 29 percent in FY86, an additional 11
percent in FY87, and faces another reduction in FY88.
The security assistance account now falls significantly
below the level needed to maintain, with no
expansion, programs critical to our national security
interests.

37

The problem of inadequate funding for foreign
assistance is compounded by Congressionally
mandated earmarks and restrictions that take an ever
larger piece of a shrinking pie. In recent years,
Congressional action has earmarked as much as 90
percent of certain foreign assistance accounts to
specific countries. These and other restrictions force
us to conduct foreign policy with our hands tied. We
are losing the ability to allocate resources according
to our strategic priorities, and we have virtually no
leeway to respond to emergencies with reallocations
of funds. The effects of earmarking on the developing
countries is particularly damaging. These smaller
programs bear a disproportionate share of the burden
when funds earmarked for large programs are
maintained at a constant level while the overall
assistance program is cut.

The adverse effects of funding cuts are not limited to
our foreign development and security assistance
programs. To properly coordinate these instruments
and to carry out our policies, we rely on our
diplomatic missions abroad. No foreign policy, no
matter how conceptually brilliant, can succeed unless
it is based on accurate information about, and correct
interpretation of, the developments in countries we are
attempting to influence. We need to be able to
persuade others that our goals are worth supporting
and that our means are appropriate. The essential
tasks of information, analysis and communication are
the primary responsibility of our embassies and
consulates.

Funds available for operating the Department of State
and our embassies and consulates overseas have been
cut to an unprecedented point. What that means in
real terms is fewer people to work on formulating and
implementing the nation’s foreign policy at all levels. It
means fewer diplomatic and consular posts— posts
which are the eyes and ears of the U.S. Government
abroad. It means not providing the country with the
level of services, reporting, analysis, or the
representation and protection of global U.S. interests
that we have come to expect.

It cannot be stressed too strongly that our diplomatic
establishment and our foreign assistance programs are
an essential part of our political and economic
elements of power. We cannot support our National
Security Strategy without them. They work to resolve
tensions and ameliorate conflicts that, if ignored,

38

 

 

could degenerate into crises adversely affecting U.S.
interests. Unless we are willing to be an active
participant in promoting the type of world order we
desire, we may find ourselves compelled to defend
our interests with more direct, costly, and painful
means. Congressional action to shore up support for
this weakened link in our capability for strategy
execution should receive high priority attention.

Adequate and sustained resource support is also
needed for our defense programs. Providing for the
common defense is the most important responsibility
of the federal government—shared equally by the
Executive and Legislative branches. Partnership is the
key to its successful execution. In that spirit, in the
early 1980s—for the third time since World War |i—
Congress and the Executive joined in a concerted
effort to rebuild and strengthen our military
capabilities. It was clear at that time that only an
increase in defense investment would produce the
necessary sustained impact on the military balance,
and redress the serious disparities between U.S. and
Soviet capabilities which had emerged during the
1970s—a period of unprecedented military investment
by the Soviets aimed at shifting the global “correlation
of forces” in a decisive and irreversible way.
Fortunately, the Congress and the American people
recognized the criticality of rebuilding the country’s
defenses, and we made impressive progress. Having
arrested the adverse trend, however, the challenge
then became not to lose the momentum gained —
always a difficult task in a democracy. Unfortunately,
we have not done as well in that regard.

When | submitted the FY88 Budget a year ago, | did
not ask the Congress to approve Defense funding
increases of the magnitude that characterized those of
the early 1980s. At the same time, | did emphasize
that Congress must act positively to protect the gains
that we together had achieved. In particular, | stressed
that we must not continue on the path of decline in
real defense spending established during the
preceding two years. With lack of perspective, we had
begun a process of reversing the improvements in the
U.S-Soviet balance achieved during the early 1980s.
Regrettably, this process continued with the legislative
action on the FY88 budget.

While the Defense figures coming out of the “budget
summit’ were significantly less damaging than would
have been the case had sequestration occurred, they

continued the downward trend of the Defense Budget,
in real terms, for the third year in a row. Soviet
spending, on the other hand, maintained its historical
pattern of real growth on the order of 3.5 percent
annually during this period of U.S. decline. The
unfortunate consequence is that sometime in the
future the American people will again be asked to
support defense capabilities for which they thought
they had once paid. In the meantime, the inefficient
procurement rates associated with instability and
reduced budgetary resources exacerbate the impact of
the Defense Budget cuts.

The FY88 cuts, coming on top of two prior years of
decline, have confronted us with a situation in which
we must now either reduce the readiness of our
forces, or lower investment and eliminate force
structure in order to allow our remaining military units
to function at an acceptable level of combat
capability. Either way, risk will grow, and deterrence
will be reduced.

The strategic implication of this continuing decline is
that U.S. forces will confront additional risk in regions
where the potential exists for high-intensity conflict,
and particularly in their ability to conduct high-
intensity operations in more than one theater
simultaneously. In global conflict this could require us
to forego opportunities to bring the conflict to early
termination by exerting military pressures on the
Soviets from several directions. It increases the
likelihood that force limitations will require us to
conduct sequential operations in successive theaters,
with the risk and uncertainty which that approach
entails.

Some will argue that the cuts do not really injure our
defense capability; that with greater imagination and a
willingness to innovate, we can do more with less in
the defense area. In this view, more thoughtful military
strategy, improved tactics, or changed emphasis in
force structure, can compensate for reduced resource
levels. In fact, our commanders work continuously to
find better ways to use the forces we have. With our
allies, we constantly strive to improve force
effectiveness, to capitalize on Soviet vulnerabilities,
and to employ competitive strategies which exploit
our technological, geographic or other advantages to
stress the Soviets’ system and require them to make
disadvantageous investments. We seek out new ideas
on military strategy and force employment, and adopt

 

 

those which promise real gains in military
effectiveness; but we should be under no illusions that
there are quick fixes which can fundamentally reduce
our current military requirements.

In this regard, it is noteworthy that—pursuant to
recommendations of the 1986 Blue Ribbon Panel on
Defense Management—the Joint Chiefs of Staff over
the past year have conducted a global net assessment
of U.S. and Soviet capabilities and reviewed the
national military strategy to examine whether
alternative approaches could improve our overall
military capability at a given budget level. They
concluded that none of the particular alternatives ex-
amined was as effective as the capabilities generated
under current plans and strategy.

That is not surprising, given the fact that our military
strategy and supporting force structure are based on
certain fundamental conditions which change slowly,
if at all. These include the immutables of geography;
the division of labor entailed in our alliance
relationships; our advantage in certain advanced
technologies; the large capital investment we have in
existing forces; and the evolution of the threat. We
will continue to review our military strategy to
revalidate and update its essential elements. But in our
deliberations we need to distinguish between soundly
analyzed recommendations for improvements in U.S.
or allied strategy—which can be helpful—and those
that simply call for a strategy which costs less, without
regard to the range of security interests it can assure.

Another way sometimes suggested to compensate for
reduced resource levels is to scale back U.S.
commitments. But commitments are not an end in
themselves; they are simply ways of protecting U.S.
interests and achieving the objectives of our National
Security Strategy.

While details of those interests and objectives may
vary over time, as noted in the first chapter of this re-
port their core elements have changed little since the
1950s. No one seriously advocates abrogation of our
treaty relationships with the NATO nations, Japan, the
Philippines, Thailand, Australia, or our Hemispheric
neighbors. Nor do responsible voices argue against
our strategic relationship with Israel, our friendly ties
with Egypt, or our cooperative relations with other
moderate Arab states. The regional strategy sections of

39

 

this report illustrate how our diplomatic, economic,
and military relationships with these and other key
countries interact to support fundamental U.S. interests
and objectives. While there may be room for
adjustments at the margin in our contributions to
regional security, none of our current commitments
are plausible candidates for major reduction, given the
scope of our global interests, the threats to those
interests, and the increasingly interdependent nature of
free world political, economic, and security
relationships. Both Congress and the Executive Branch
should continue to review our commitments
worldwide, but | see no prudent way to reduce those
commitments while remaining true to our values,
maintaining essential and mutually beneficial alliance
relationships, and safeguarding our future.

This does not imply that the United States is
necessarily satisfied with the contributions which our
allies and friends make to the common defense in
those regions where we have major military
commitments. In Europe in particular, our NATO allies
can and should do more to enhance Alliance
conventional defense capabilities. We will continue to
press them for more appropriate levels of defense
investment and improved efficiency in the use of
Alliance resources, while rejecting the self-defeating
argument that the failure of some allies to meet
agreed goals should prompt us to reduce our own
contribution to Alliance capabilities. We are in Europe
because it is in our interest to be there; and, within
the limits of Congressional funding, we will continue
to contribute those forces which we believe are
essential to the support of our national security
interests and objectives. At the same time we expect
our allies to show an equal interest in the common
defense, and to recognize the need to take on an
increasing share of the burden as we work together to
improve NATO's conventional defense capability and
the plans for employing it.

Finally, | should note that the defense program
required to support our strategy is eminently
affordable. In fact, in the past seven years, Americans
have devoted an average of only 6.1 percent of gross
national product (GNP) to national defense—well
under rates in the 1950s and 1960s, which averaged
about 10 percent. Similarly, at about 28 percent of
federal outlays, defense spending falls well below the
peacetime average of 41 percent during the postwar
era. In both instances, the increases of the early 1980s

40

 

seem large only because the spending of the late
1970s, which averaged less than 5 percent of GNP,
was so severely depressed. The resources needed to
support our national strategy, at a prudent level of
risk, are within our ability to pay. Failure to provide
these resources simply defers to future budgets the
task of regaining lost ground, while increasing risks to
our security in the near-term.

BIPARTISAN COOPERATION

The continued development and successful execution
of U.S. National Security Strategy is a major
responsibility of the Executive Branch. But, as the
foregoing discussion has emphasized, we cannot
accomplish this alone. Supporting a security strategy
that provides a sound vision for the future and a
realistic guide to action must be a cooperative
endeavor of the Administration and the Congress.

In this regard, | believe both branches need to review
their constitutional roles and the relationship between
them in the national security area. There are
important powers here; some that are best shared,
some that are Presidential responsibilities. After seven
years in office, | am convinced that the numerous
consultative arrangements established between the two
branches in areas such as arms negotiations,
intelligence, and military contingency operations
generally represent the best way to coordinate our
views and resolve our differences. We should continue
to look for ways to improve these arrangements; but
they are far superior to more rigid structural
alternatives that, in response to a specific set of
circumstances, would attempt to define in law the
precise constitutional boundaries of Executive and
Legislative authority which the Founding Fathers
purposely left in broad terms.

Equally detrimental is the increasing tendency of the
Congress to act in a directive manner with regard to
details of foreign, defense, and arms control policy,
limiting the flexibility of the Executive Branch by
enacting into law positions on which the President
should be allowed reasonable discretion. This trend
diminishes our ability to conduct rational and
coherent policies on the world scene; reduces our
leverage in critical negotiations; and impedes the
integrated use of U.S. power to achieve important

ee =|

national security objectives. It causes others to view
us as unreliable, and diminishes our influence
generally.

In addition, | would suggest that the Congress
reconsider how it can best organize itself for fulfiling
its Constitutional role. Over the past twenty years,
power and authority have effectively drifted away from
experienced leadership and committee chairmen, and
toward individual members and special interest
coalitions. From a Congressional perspective, Cabinet
Secretaries and White House advisers may present di-
verse points of view while policy is in the formative
state; but the President speaks with authority once
policy decisions are made. The President, however,

faces a far different situation in dealing with Congress.

In approaching the Congress as a partner in the
formulation of national security policy, the President
must have confidence that the Legislative branch
leadership is capable of implementing any consensus
that is reached, without being second-guessed or
undercut by autonomous members or interest groups.

This suggests the need for other legislative reforms. |
have often emphasized that restoring and maintaining
an adequate military balance, and fulfilling our
international obligations, requires a long view and
fiscal stability. This is not accomplished in a repetitive
and topsy-turvy annual budget cycle. We must face
squarely the need for multi-year authorizations and
appropriations, consistent with constitutional

 

limitations, in order to support our national security
and international affairs programs more efficiently and
effectively. While some progress has been made,
particularly with the recent adoption by the Congress
of a partial two-year defense authorization bill, much
more can and should be done. In this regard, it is
important to recall the conclusion of the Blue Ribbon
Commission on Defense Management that, in the
future, significant efficiencies in the defense budget
are more likely to be achieved through greater
program stability than through specific management
improvements by the Department of Defense.

Above all, we must both work harder to rebuild a
bipartisan public consensus on our National! Security
Strategy and the resources needed to execute it. The
fundamental policies and strategies we have pursued
are similar to, and consistent with, those pursued by
previous generations of American leaders. Renewed
consensus will be forged on the anvil of public
debate—among responsible officials in government,
between the Congress and the Executive, in
consultations with our allies and friends, and among
the larger community of interested and concerned
American citizens. We look forward to that debate and
to working with the Congress to achieve increased
understanding of, and broad support for, our National
Security Strategy. There can be no endeavor more
important for the long-term well-being of the
American people; and | solicit the Congress’ closest
collaboration in achieving it.

Preface | |

 

In the aftermath of World War li, the United States took on an unaccustomed burden—the responsibility to lead and
help defend the world’s free nations. This country took bold and unprecedented steps to aid the recovery of both allies
and defeated foes, to provide a shield behind which democracy could flourish, and to extend its hand in aid of global
economic progress. The challenge of an aggressive, repressive Soviet Union was contained by a system of alliances,

which we helped create, and led.

In this historic endeavor, America has succeeded—brilliantly. But it was inevitable that new conditions created by this
success would eventually call for a new kind of American leadership. It was inevitable that our overwhelming
economic predominance after the war would be reduced as our friends, with our help, grew stronger. And perhaps it
was inevitable that the Soviet Union, met by a strong coalition of free nations determined to resist its encroachments,
would have to turn inward to face the internal contradictions of its own deeply flawed system—as our policy of contain-

ment always envisioned.

Today, after four decades, the international landscape is marked by change that is breath-taking in its character,
dimension, and pace. The familiar moorings of postwar security policy are being loosened by developments that were
barely imagined years or even months ago. Yet, our goals and interests remain constant. And, as we look toward—and
hope for—a better tomorrow, we must also look to those elements of our past policy that have played a major role in
bringing us to where we are today.

It is our steadfastness over four decades that has brought us to this moment of historic opportunity.

We will not let that opportunity pass, nor will we shrink from the challenges created by new conditions. Our response
will require strategic vision—a clear perception of our goals, our interests, and the means available to achieve and
protect them. The essence of strategy is determining priorities. We will make the hard choices.

‘
This Report outlines the direction we will take to protect the legacy of the postwar era while enabling the United
States to help shape a new era, one that moves beyond containment and that will take us into the next century.

1 invite the American people and Congress to join us in a dialogue that will inform and enlighten the difficult
decisions we will have to make in the months and years ahead.

I. The Foundations of National Strategy: _
Goals and Interests

Enduring Elements of Our
National Strategy

Throughout our history, our national security strategy
has pursued broad, consistent goals. We have always
sought to protect the safety of the nation, its citizens,
and its way of life. We have also worked to advance
the welfare of our people by contributing to an
international environment of peace, freedom, and
progress within which our democracy—and other free
nations—can flourish.

These broad goals have guided American foreign and
defense policy throughout the life of the Republic.
They were as much the driving force behind President
Jefferson's decision to send the American Navy against
the Pasha of Tripoli in 1804 as they were when
President Reagan directed American naval and air
forces to return to that area in 1986. They animated
Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, and my initiatives
in support of democracy in Eastern Europe this past
year. an

In addition, this Nation has always felt a powerful
sense of community with those other nations that
shared our values. We have always believed that, al-
though the flourishing of democracy in America did
not require a completely democratic world, it could
not long survive in. one largely totalitarian. it is a
common moral vision that holds together our
alliances in Europe, East Asia, and other parts of the
world—a vision shaped by the Magna Carta, our
Declaration of independence and Bill of Rights, the
Declaration of the Rights of Man, the United Nations
Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
and the Helsinki Final Act. The American
commitment to an alliance strategy, therefore, has a

 

more enduring basis than simply the perception of a
common enemy.

Another enduring element of our strategy has been a
commitment to a free and open international
economic system. America has championed liberal
trade to enhance world prosperity as well as to reduce
political friction among nations. We must never forget
the vicious cycle of protectionism that helped deepen
the Great Depression and indirectly fostered the Sec-
ond World War. Like so many of its predecessors, my
Administration is committed to working with all
nations to promote the prosperity of the free market
system and to reduce barriers that unfairly inhibit
international commerce. In particular, it would be a
tragedy of immense proportions if trade disputes
weakened political ties that forty years of military
threat could not undo.

 

Our location on the globe has also defined a
consistent element of our security strategy. We have
been blessed with large oceans east and west and
friendly neighbors north and south. But many of our
closest friends and allies and important economic and
political interests are great distances from the United
States, Therefore, in the modern era we have
maintained the ability to project American power to
help preserve the international equilibrium—globally
and regionally—in support of peace and security.

In particular, for most of this century, the United States
has deemed it a vital interest to prevent any hostile
power or group of powers from dominating the Eura-
sian land mass. This interest remains. In the period
since World War II, it has required a commitment to
forward defense and forward military deployments,
and a recognition of the lesson of the 1930s—that
peace and security come only through vigilance and

1

 

preparedness. This strategy was described as a strategy
of containment of Soviet expansionism. Its purpose
was not the division of the world into American and
Soviet spheres of influence, but, on the contrary,
fostering the reemergence of independent centers of
power in Europe and Asia. Behind this shield, our
friends built up their strength and created institutions
of unity (like the European Community), and our
system demonstrated its political and economic
vitality. It was our conviction that in these conditions,
a steadfast policy of resistance to encroachments
would, over time, in George Kennan’s famous words,
lead to “the breakup or the gradual mellowing of
Soviet power.”

This we now see. The very success of containment
has created new conditions and new opportunities for
. a new generation of Americans. We welcome this
change. Yet our basic values—and our basic
geopolitical necessities— remain. As the world’s most
_ powerful democracy, we are inescapably the leader,
‘the connecting link in a global alliance of -
democracies. The pivotal responsibility for ensuring
the stability of the international balance remains ours,
even as its requirements change in a new era. As the
world enters a period of new hope for peace, it
would be foolhardy to neglect the basic conditions of
security that are bringing it about.

Our Interests and Objectives
in the 1990s

Our broad national interests and objectives are
enduring. They can be summed up as follows:

The survival of the United States as a free and
independent nation, with its fundamental values
intact and its institutions and people secure.

The United States seeks, whenever possible in concert
with its allies, to:

¢ deter any aggression that could threaten its security
and, should deterrence fail, repel or defeat military
attack and end conflict on terms favorable to the
United States, its interests and allies;

© deal effectively with threats to the security of the
United States and its citizens and interests short of

 

armed conflict, including the threat of international
terrorism;

¢ improve strategic stability by pursuing equitable
and verifiable arms control agreements,
modernizing our strategic deterrent, developing
technologies for strategic defense, and
strengthening our conventional capabilities;

* encourage greater recognition of the principles of
human rights, market,incentives, and free elections
in the Soviet Union while fostering restraint in
Soviet military spending and discouraging Soviet
adventurism;

¢ prevent the transfer of militarily critical
technologies and resources to hostile countries or
groups, especially the spread of weapons of mass
destruction and associated high-technology means
of delivery; and

¢ reduce the flow of illegal drugs into the United
States.

A healthy. and growing U.S. economy to ensure
opportunity for individual prosperity and a resource
base for national endeavors at home and abroad.

National security and economic strength are
indivisible. We seek to:

© promote a strong, prosperous, and competitive U.S.
economy;

© ensure access to foreign markets, energy, mineral
resources, the oceans, and space; and

* promote an open and expanding international
economic system with minimal distortions to trade
and investment, stable currencies, and broadly
agreed and respected rules for managing and
resolving economic disputes.

A stable and secure world, fostering political
freedom, human rights, and democratic institutions.

We seek to:

© promote the rule of law and diplomatic solutions to
regional conflicts;

¢ maintain stable regional military balances to deter
those powers that might seek regional dominance;

 

 

 

 

 

¢ support aid, trade, and investment policies that
promote economic development and social and
political progress;

© promote the growth of free, democratic political
institutions, as the surest guarantee of both human
rights and economic and social progress; and

¢ aid in combatting threats to democratic institutions
from aggression, coercion, insurgencies, subversion,
terrorism, and illicit drug trafficking.

Healthy, cooperative and politically vigorous
relations with allies and friendly nations.

To build and nurture such relationships, we seek to:

¢ strengthen and enlarge the commonwealth of free
nations that share a commitment to democracy and
individual rights;

 

establish a more balanced partnership with our
allies and a greater sharing of global leadership and
responsibilities;

support greater economic, political, and defense
integration in Western Europe and a closer
relationship between the United States and the
European Community;

work with our allies in the North Atlantic Alliance

and fully utilize the processes of the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe to bring about

reconciliation, security, and democracy in a Europe
whole and free; and

make international institutions more effective in
promoting peace, world order, and political,
economic and social progress.

 

 

 

 

Il. Trends in the World Today:
Opportunities and Uncertainties

Broadly and properly understood, our national
security strategy is shaped by the totality of the
domestic and international environment—an
environment that is today dramatically changing.

The Crisis in Communism

Future historians may well conclude that the most
notable strategic development of the present period is
the systemic crisis engulfing the Communist world.
This crisis takes many forms and has many causes:

¢ After the Vietnam trauma of the 1970s, the West's
political recovery in the 1980s—including its
rearmament and such successes as the INF
deployment in Europe—undermined the Soviet
leaders’ assumptions that the global “correlation of
forces” was shifting in their favor.

¢ While the industrial democracies surge headlong
into a post-industrial era of supercomputers,
microelectronics, and telecommunications,
Communist states have been ‘mired in stagnation,
paralyzed by outmoded statist dogmas that stifle
innovation and productivity. Poor economic
performance, especially in contrast with the West,
has discredited a system that prided itself on its
mastery of economic forces. And the new
Information Revolution has posed for totalitarian
regimes the particular challenge that clinging to old
policies of restricting information would lead to
permanent technological paralysis.

¢ A new Soviet leadership in the mid-1980s
recognized that its system was in crisis and
undertook an ambitious program of reform, Abroad,

 

this leadership sought a calmer international
environment in order to concentrate on its internal
crisis. This has led, for example, to a Soviet troop
withdrawal from Afghanistan and Soviet diplomatic
interest in compromise solutions to regional
conflicts, as Moscow sought gradually (and
selectively) to scale back costly overseas
commitments. These commitments had been made
costly by indigenous resistance—supported by
reinvigorated Western policies of engagement.

¢ In 1989, in parallel with the negotiation on
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), the
Soviets began unilaterally reducing their heavy
military burden and their presence in Eastern
Europe, while proclaiming (and thus far
demonstrating) a more tolerant policy toward their
East bloc neighbors’ internal affairs. We have seen
powerful pent-up democratic forces unleashed all
across Eastern Europe that have overturned
Communist dictatorships and are reversing the
pattern of Soviet dominance.

We are facing a strategic transformation born of the

success of our postwar policies. Yet, such fundamental

political change will likely be turbulent. There may be

setbacks and new sources of instability. Happy

endings are never guaranteed. We can only be a
impressed by the uncertainties that remain as the So-

viet Union and the states of Eastern Europe, each in

its own way, advance into historically uncharted

waters.

The Industrial Democracies

The industrial democracies also face strategic
challenges, some of them serious, but they too are

 

largely the products of our success. These include a
shifting balance of economic power and the danger
that trade disputes in an era of economic change and
adjustment could strain political and security ties.
Such strains would be especially damaging at a
moment when we need to maintain strength and
unity to take best advantage of new opportunities in
East-West relations which that strength and unity have
helped bring about.

The growing strength and self-reliance of our allies in
Western Europe and East Asia have already resulted in
a greater sharing of leadership responsibility—as the
European Community (EC) has shown in policies
towards Eastern Europe and as Japan has shown in
international economic assistance.

One of the dramatic strategic developments of the
1990s will be the new role of Japan and Germany as
successful democracies and economic and political
leaders. U.S. policy has long encouraged such an
evolution. It will provide powerful new reasons to
maintain the partnerships—the Atlantic Alliance, the
EC, and the U.S.-Japan security alliance—that have
fostered reconciliation, reassurance, democracy, and
security in Europe and Asia in the postwar period.

The Global Economy

In a new era of technological innovation and global
markets, the world economy will be more competitive
than ever before. The phenomenal growth in East Asia
will likely continue, and by early in the next century
the combined output of Japan, the Republic of Korea,
China, and Taiwan may exceed our own. Western
Europe—as it progressively removes barriers to the
free flow of labor, capital, and goods within the EC—
will become an even stronger economic power. The
Soviet Union, even with a measure of success for
perestroika, will likely slip further behind the United
States, Japan, and Western Europe in output. In many
other areas of the world, economic expansion will not
keep pace with population growth or the debt
burden, further squeezing resources and fomenting
unrest and instability. All these developments carry
significant security implications as well as their
obvious economic and social import.

The diffusion of economic power that will almost
certainly continue is, in part, a reflection of a wise

6

 

and successful U.S. policy aimed at promoting
worldwide economic growth. Provided that the world
economic system remains an open and expanding
one, we ourselves will benefit from the growth of
others. But American leadership will remain pivotal. A
healthy American economy is essential to sustain that
leadership role,'as well as to foster global economic
development and ease dangerous pressures for
unilateralism, regionalism, and protectionism.

Third World Conflicts

In a new era, some Third World conflicts may no
longer take place against the backdrop of superpower
competition. Yet many will, for a variety of reasons,
continue to threaten U.S. interests. The erosion of
U.S.-Soviet bipolarity could permit and in some ways
encourage the growth of these challenges.

Highly destructive regional wars will remain a danger,
made even greater by the expansion of the armed
forces of regional powers and the proliferation of
advanced weaponry. And it will be increasingly diffi-
cult to slow the spread of chemical, biological, and
nuclear weapons—along with long-range delivery
systems. Instability in areas troubled by poverty,
injustice, racial, religious or ethnic tension will
continue, whether or not exploited by the Soviets.
Religious fanaticism may continue to endanger
American lives, or countries friendly to us in the
Middle East, on whose energy resources the free
world continues to depend. The scourge of terrorism,
and of states who sponsor it, likewise remains a
threat.

Trends in Weaponry

Modern battlefields are characterized by an
unprecedented lethality. The greater precision, range,
and destructiveness of conventional weapons now
extend war across a wider geographic area, and make
it much more rapid and intense. As global weapons
production becomes more diffused, these weapons are
increasingly available to smaller powers, narrowing
the military gap between ourselves and regional states
and making some Third World battlefields in many
ways as demanding as those we would expect in
Central Europe.

 

 

 

 

The United States has a competitive edge in most
technologies relevant to advanced weaponry, but we
must continue to translate this advantage into fielded
weapon systems supported by appropriate tactical
doctrine and operational art. New conditions require
continuing innovation as we move to incorporate
stealth technology, extremely accurate weapons,
improved means of locating targets, and new
operational concepts into our combat forces.

illicit Drugs

Traffic in illicit drugs imposes exceptional costs on the
economy of the United States, undermines our
national values and institutions, and is directly
responsible for the destruction and loss of many
American lives. The international traffic in illicit drugs
constitutes a major threat to our national security and
to the security of other nations.

We will increase our efforts to reduce both the supply
of and the demand for illicit drugs. Internationally, we
will attack the production of such drugs, and the
multinational criminal organizations which enable
illicit drugs to be processed, transported, and
distributed. A cornerstone of our international drug
control strategy is to work with and motivate other
countries to help defeat the illicit drug trade and re-
duce the demand for drugs.

As we intensify our programs, we will increase our
actions aimed at controlling the flow of drugs across
our borders. In this area, as in others, we will make

_increased use of the resources and expertise provided
by the Department of Defense. We recognize that

military involvement in this mission has costs, and
that in a world of finite resources increased effort here
is at the expense of other important defense activities.
We accept these trade-offs, and we will do the job.

Refugees

The dislocations of a turbulent world—famine,
persecution, war, and tyranny—have swelled the wave
of refugees across the planet to a total that now
exceeds 14 million. Many have literally been forced
from their homes by the heavy hand of tyranny.

 

Thousands of others have fled their homelands to
escape oppression. Millions from Afghanistan,
Ethiopia, and Mozambique have moved simply to stay
alive. Others subsist in camps, from one generation to
the next, awaiting solutions to seemingly intractable
political and-ethnic disputes. Beyond the deep
personal tragedies these figures represent, such a vast
refugee population taxes the world community's
resources, denies to that community the many
contributions these peoples could make in more
benign circumstances, and fuels the hatreds that will
ignite future conflicts.

The United States has a proud tradition, as long as
our history, of welcoming refugees to our shores. We
also take pride in our work with international
agencies to provide assistance and relief for refugees,
even as we strive politically to resolve the conflicts
that provoked their flight. We have encouraged the
restructuring of relief organizations to make them
more effective and efficient-to make certain that
scarce resources reach those who need them. This
year, through our budget and the generosity of private
groups, we will take in more refugees than last year.
We will maintain a compassionate and generous
program of resettlement in the United States and
assistance for refugees worldwide.

Issues for the Future

The security environment we face in the 1990s is
more hopeful, but in many ways also more uncertain
than at any time in the recent past. Some of the
questions before us are:

© How can we ensure continued international
stability as U.S.-Soviet bipolarity gives way to
global interdependence and multipolarity? What
will be America’s continuing leadership role—and
the new roles of leadership assumed by our allies?

What are the risks that today’s positive strategic
trends will be reversed, and how do we take due
account of them in our long-term planning? How
much risk can we prudently accept in an era of
strategic change, fiscal austerity, and great
“uncertainty?

 

 

® While maintaining a balance of power with the
Soviet Union as an inescapable American priority,
- how do we adapt our forces for the continuing
challenge of contingencies elsewhere in the world?

¢ How do we maintain the cohesion among allies
and friends that remains indispensable to common
security and prosperity, as the perceived threat of a
common danger weakens?

© What will be the structure of the new Europe—
politically, economically, and militarily—as the

Eastern countries move toward democracy and
Germany moves toward unification?

© If military factors loom less large in a world of a
more secure East-West balance, how shal! we
marshall the other instruments of policy to promote
our interests and objectives?

In shaping a national security strategy for the 1990s,
we will need answers to these and other questions.
Our preliminary assessments are reflected in the
sections that follow.

 

Ill. Regional Challenges and Responses

Although we are a global power, our interests are not
equally engaged or threatened everywhere. In the face
of competing demands, budgetary stringency, and an
improving East-West climate, we must review our
priorities. Where our capabilities fall short of needs,
we must assess the risks and employ the full panoply
of our policy instruments to minimize them.

Our relationship with the Soviet Union retains a stra-
tegic priority because that country remains the only
other military superpower. Even as tensions ease and
military forces are reduced on both sides, maintaining
the global strategic balance is inescapably an
American concern; there is no substitute for our
efforts.

Yet, the extraordinary changes taking place, if their
promise is fulfilled, will permit important changes in
our defense posture—and a greater possibility of
viewing other regions in their own right, independent
of the East-West context.

The Soviet Union

Our goal is to move beyond containment, to seek the
integration of the Soviet Union into the international
system as a constructive partner. For the first time in
the postwar period, this goal appears within reach.

The Soviet Union has taken major steps toward
rapprochement with the international system, after sev-
enty years of seeking to undermine it; it has
repudiated its doctrines of class warfare and military
superiority and criticized major tenets of its own
postwar policy. It has begun to move toward
democracy. All this we can only applaud.

 

The United States will seek to engage the USSR in a
relationship that is increasingly cooperative. Moscow
will find us a willing partner in creating the
conditions that will permit the Soviet Union to join,
and be welcome in, a peaceful, free, and prosperous
international community. We will expand contacts for
mutual benefit, to promote the free flow of ideas and
democratic values in the Soviet Union, and to lay a
firmer foundation for a deeper relationship over the
long term. Our Open Lands proposal, for example,
would abolish the “closed zones” that unnecessarily
impede contacts by diplomats, businessmen, tourists,
students, and journalists. To support Soviet economic
reform, | have proposed immediate negotiations on a
U.S-Soviet trade agreement so that—pending action by
the Supreme Soviet to codify emigration reform—we
could grant Most Favored Nation status to the Soviet
Union at the June 1990 Summit. We have offered to
support observer status for the Soviet Union in the
structures created by the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) after the Uruguay Round of
Multilateral Trade Negotiations is completed, and |
personally urged Chairman Gorbachev to use the
intervening time to move more rapidly towards market
practices in the Soviet economy. We are also
expanding technical economic cooperation and have
begun discussions on a bilateral investment treaty.

We strongly support today’s dramatic process of
political and economic reform, and have a significant
stake ‘in its success. Yet, U.S. policy does not and
cannot depend on a particular leader or set of leaders
in the USSR. We look for fundamental alterations in
Soviet institutions and practices that can only be
reversed at great economic and political costs."" In the
political sphere, democracy is the best assurance of
irreversible change. In the military sphere, with
agreements in place—and weapons destroyed,

 

 

production lines converted, and forces demobilized —
any future Soviet leadership would find it costly, time-
consuming, and difficult to renew the pursuit of
military supremacy and impossible to attempt without
providing ample strategic warning. These must be our
standards.

Even if the U.S.-Soviet relationship remains
competitive, it can be made less militarized and far
safer. We will seek effectively verifiable arms control
agreements with the Soviet Union and others as an
integral component of our security strategy.

But whatever course the Soviets take over the next
decade, the Soviet Union will remain a formidable
military power. The United States must continue to
maintain modern defenses that strengthen deterrence
and enhance security. We cannot ignore continuing
Soviet efforts to modernize qualitatively even as they
cut back quantitatively. As Chairman Gorbachev
declared last September 21st, “While reducing
expenditure for [defense] purposes, we are paying
attention to the qualitative rearmament of the Army,
and in this way we are not permitting the overall
level of our defense capability to be weakened in any
degree.” Our response thus represents prudent
caution, but the Soviet leadership and people should
realize that it is a caution based on uncertainty, not
on hostility.

Restructuring the Soviet Union’s relationship to the
international community is as ambitious a task as
containment was for its time. Responsibility for
creating the conditions for it lies first and foremost
with the Soviet Union itself. But the United States is
determined, together with our allies, to challenge and
test Soviet intentions and—while maintaining our
guard—to work to put Soviet relations with the West
on a firmer, more constructive course than had ever
been thought possible in the postwar era.

Western Europe

The nations of the Atlantic Community, defined by
their common values, are the founding members of a
larger commonwealth of free nations—those states that
share a commitment to freedom and individual rights.
Ours is an alliance rooted in a shared history and

10

 

 

heritage. Even if the military confrontation in Europe
diminishes dramatically—as is our goal—the natural
partnership of democratic allies will endure, grounded
in its moral and political values.

The continued strength of the Alliance and our
leadership within it remain essential to peace. The
Soviet Union, even if its forces were pulled back
entirely within its territory, would remain by virtue of
geography a major military factor in Central Europe.
Security and stability in Europe will therefore continue
to depend on a substantial American presence,
political and military. As | have repeatedly pledged,
the United States will maintain significant military
forces in Europe as long as our allies desire our pres-
ence as part of a common security effort. Our nuclear
power remains the ultimate deterrent of aggression,
even at lower force levels.

In Europe's emerging new. political environment,
moreover, the Atlantic Alliance remains a natural
association of free nations and the natural framework
for harmonizing Western policies on both security
and diplomacy. It embodies the continuing American
commitment to Europe; it also sustains the overall
structure of stability that can assure the success of
the democratic evolution of Central and Eastern
Europe.

Yet, within this framework, the “European pillar’ of
the Atlantic world is being strengthened before our
eyes—another dramatic development of this period.
The United States categorically supports greater West-
ern European economic and political integration, as a
fulfillment of Europe’s identity and destiny and as a
necessary step toward a more balanced sharing of
leadership and responsibility within the broader
Atlantic Community. European unity and Alliance
partnership do not conflict; they reinforce each other.
We support the European Community's efforts to
create a single unified market by 1992. A strong
European Community will ensure more efficient use
of European resources for common efforts, and will
also be a strategic magnet to the nations of Eastern
Europe. We also support increased Western European
military cooperation and coordination, within the
overall framework of the Atlantic Alliance, including
both bilateral efforts and those in the Western
European Union. We strongly support the
independent British and French nuclear deterrent
forces and their continued modernization.

 

 

 

 

The unification of Germany is coming about—by
peaceful means, on the basis of democracy, and in
the framework of the Western relationships that have
nurtured peace and freedom for four decades. This is
a triumph for the West. We expect a unified Germany
to remain a member of both the North Atlantic
Alliance and the European Community, as all of us
seek to foster the conditions for wider reconciliation
in Europe.

As the European-American relationship shifts, frictions
can arise. Statesmanship will be needed to ease them.
The challenges that the Western democracies face in
this environment, however, are challenges to wise
policy, not to the nature of their system. Assuming the
democracies maintain discipline in their diplomatic,
defense, and economic policies, we face an
extraordinary opportunity to shape events in
accordance with our values and our vision of the
future.

Eastern Europe

The United States and its allies are dedicated to
overcoming the division of Europe. All the countries
of Eastern Europe are entitled to become part of the
worldwide commonwealth of free nations as, one by
one, they reclaim the European cultural and political
tradition that is their heritage. Overcoming this
division depends on their achievement of self-
determination and independence. We will accept no
arrangements with Moscow that would limit these
rights, and we expect the Soviet Union to continue to
repudiate in deeds as well as in words all right and
pretext to intervene in the affairs of East European
states. A free and prosperous €astern Europe is not a
threat to legitimate Soviet security interests, and every
day it becomes easier to envision the time when East-
ern and Western states can freely associate in the
same social and economic organizations. The Cold
War began with the division of Europe. it can truly
end only when Europe is whole again.

We share with our allies a vision of Europe whole
and free:

© We believe democratic institutions and values will
be the core of the new Europe, as it is these
institutions and values that today stand vindicated.

 

© Even as fundamental political changes are still
evolving, we place high priority on moving rapidly
to a level of forces lower and more stabilizing, with
greater openness for military activities.

The United States intends to play a role in fostering
Eastern Europe’s economic development, supporting
its democratic institutions, and ensuring the overall
structure of stability. It has become dramatically clear
that the American role is welcomed by the peoples of
Eastern Europe, who—in the new Europe that is
emerging—see our presence as reassuring. Naturally,
our relations with. East European countries will be
affected by their policies on matters of concern to us,
such as espionage, illicit technology transfer,
terrorism, and subversion in the Third World.

In November-—as an investment in our own security
as well as in the freedom and well-being of the
peoples of Eastern Europe—I signed into law
legislation authorizing $938 million in assistance

to support democracy in Poland and Hungary. tn my
FY 1991 budget | have proposed an additional
$300 million as we begin to expand our program to
encompass other new East European democracies.
In addition, we have offered our best advice

and expertise in support of economic reform,

trade liberalization, labor market reforms,

private sector development, and environmental
protection. This marks a major and positive

step in bipartisan foreign policy and underscores
the strength of the American commitment to assist
Eastern Europe's historic march toward

freedom.

We will also look to the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) to play a greater role,
since the CSCE stands for the freedom of people to
choose their destiny under a rule of law with rulers
who are democratically accountable. We suggested
last year that we expand the CSCE human rights .
basket to include standards for democratic

pluralism and free elections, and that we breathe new
life into the economic dimension of CSCE by
focusing on the practical problems of the transition
from stagnant planned economies-to free and
competitive markets. The time is ripe for such

steps.

11

 

The Western Hemisphere

The Western Hemisphere has within reach the great
goal of becoming history's first entirely democratic
hemisphere. The dramatic victory of the Nicaraguan
opposition in the February 25th elections has given a
significant boost to the underlying trend toward
democracy evident in the region over the past several
years. The United States has long considered that its
own security is inextricably linked to the hemisphere’s
collective security, social peace, and economic
progress. The resurgence of democracy supports these
objectives, and strengthens our natural unity just as
another traditional stimulus to solidarity—fear of an
extra-hemispheric threat—is receding. In a new era,
our hemispheric policy seeks a new spirit of mature
partnership.

We must continue, however, to counter security
threats. Improvement in our relations with Cuba
depends upon political liberalization there and an end
to its subversion of other governments and the
undermining of the peace process in the region. In
Nicaragua, our goal is to assist the new government
of Violeta Chamorro in its efforts to nurture
democratic institutions, rebuild the economy, and
scale back the Nicaraguan military. We support the
Salvadoran government's military and political efforts
to defeat the Communist insurgency.

Central America remains a disruptive factor in the
U.S.-Soviet relationship. We hold the Soviet Union
accountable for the behavior of its clients, and believe
that Soviet cooperation in fostering democracy in the
region is an important test of the new thinking in
Soviet policy. |

We will find new ways to cooperate with our two
closest neighbors, Canada and Mexico. We strongly
support the new democratic government in Panama,
which is also the best long-term guarantee of the
security and efficient operation of the Panama Canal.
We will continue to seek a transition to democracy in
Haiti, promoting international efforts in support of free
elections. The return to democracy in most of Latin
America will put new emphasis on our efforts to
support professional, apolitical militaries. We will also
confront the challenge to democracy posed by the
drug trade and debt problems.

12

 

East Asia and the Pacific

Our network of alliances and our forces deployed in
the region have ensured the stability that has made
this area’s striking progress possible.

In addition to our own deterrent strength, security in
the region has rested since the 1970s on an
unprecedented structure of harmonious relations
among the region’s key states. Our alliance with Japan
remains a centerpiece Of our security policy and an
important anchor of stability. Japan’s importance is
now global. Our relationship is one of the most
important bilateral relationships in the world and it is
in our strategic interest to preserve it.

The relationship between the United States and
China, restored in the early 1970s after so many years
of estrangement, has also contributed crucially to
regional stability and the global balance of power.
The United States strongly deplored the repression in
China last June and we have imposed sanctions to,
demonstrate our displeasure. At the same time, we
have sought to avoid a total cutoff of China’s ties to
the outside world. Those ties not only have strategic
importance, both globally and regionally; they are
crucial to China’s prospects for regaining the path of
economic reform and political liberalization. China’s
angry isolation would harm all of these prospects.

The U.S. security commitment to the Republic of
Korea remains firm; we seek a reduction in tensions
on the Korean peninsula and fully endorse Seoul’s
efforts to open a fruitful South-North dialogue. Our
strong and healthy ties with our ally Australia
contribute directly to regional and global stability. The
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
continues to play a major role in the region’s security
and prosperity.

In Cambodia, the United States seeks a comprehen-
sive settlement, one which will bring the Cambodian
people true peace and a government they have freely
chosen.

As we have amply demonstrated, we support the
Philippines’ democratic institutions and its efforts to
achieve prosperity, social progress, and internal
security. We will negotiate with the Philippines in
good faith on the status of our military facilities there.

 

 

ee

These facilities support a continued and needed
American forward presence that benefits us, the
Philippines, regional security, and global stability.

The Middle East and
South Asia

The free world’s reliance on energy supplies from this
pivotal region and our strong ties with many of the
region’s countries continue to constitute important
interests of the United States.

Soviet policies in the region show signs of
moderating, but remain contradictory. The supply of
advanced arms to Libya and Syria continues (as does
the cultivation of Iran), though Soviet diplomacy has
moved in other respects in more constructive
directions.

The Middle East is a vivid example, however, of a
region in which, even as East-West tensions diminish,
American strategic concerns remain. Threats to our
interests—including the security of Israel and
moderate Arab states as well as the free flow of oil—
come from a variety of sources. In the 1980s, our
military engagements—in Lebanon in 1983-84, Libya
in 1986, and the Persian Gulf in 1987-88—were in
response to threats to U.S. interests that could not be
laid at the Kremlin’s door. The necessity to defend our
interests will continue.

Therefore, we will maintain a naval presence in the
eastern Mediterranean Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the
Indian Ocean. We will conduct periodic exercises
and pursue improved host-nation support and
prepositioning of equipment throughout the region. In
addition, we will discourage destabilizing arms sales
to regional states, especially where there is the
potential for upsetting local balances of power or
accelerating wasteful arms races. We are especially
committed to working to curb the proliferation of nu-
clear, chemical, and other weapons of mass destruc-
tion, the means to produce them, and associated long-
range delivery systems. We will confront and build
international pressure against those states that sponsor
terrorism and subversion. And we will continue to
promote a peace process designed to satisfy legitimate
Palestinian political rights in a manner consonant with
our enduring commitment to Israel’s security.

 

In South Asia, Pakistan and India are both friends of
the United. States. We applaud the return of
democracy to Pakistan and the trends of economic
liberalization in both countries. We will seek to
maintain our special relationship with our traditional
ally Pakistan, steadily improve our relations with
India, and encourage Indo-Pakistani rapprochement
and a halt to nuclear proliferation. While we
welcome the withdrawal of Soviet military forces from
Afghanistan, the massive and continuing Soviet arms
supply to the illegitimate regime in Kabul reinforces
the need for continued U.S. support to the
Mujahiddin in their quest for self-determination for
the Afghan people. We remain firmly committed to a
comprehensive political settlement as the best means
of achieving Afghan self-determination and regional
security.

Africa

Institution-building, economic development, and
regional peace are the goals of our policy in Africa.
The global trends of democracy must come to Africa
too. All these goals must be achieved if Africa is to
play its rightful role as an important factor in the
international system. Africa is a major contributor to
the world supply of raw materials and minerals and a
region of enormous human potential.

In the strategic dimension, the United States has
pressed hard throughout the 1980s for the liquidation
of all the Soviet/Cuban military interventions in Africa
left over from the 1970s. The New York Accords of
December, 1988, were the culmination of an eight-
year U.S. effort for peace in Angola, and independ-
ence for Namibia. As a result, Cuban forces are
departing Angola, and Namibia will become
independent on March 21st. In the Horn of Africa,
the United States has encouraged negotiated solutions
to the region’s conflicts.

In the economic dimension, the United States will
continue to advocate reforms that eliminate wasteful
and unproductive state-owned enterprises and that
liberate the productive private sector and individual
initiative. The United States has significantly increased
the assistance it provides through our Development
Fund for Africa. We continue to be the biggest donor
of humanitarian aid and have helped international

13

 

 

 

organizations and voluntary associations to distribute
food, medicines, and other assistance.

We continue to press for a rapid and complete end to
South Africa’s system of apartheid. We support negoti-
ations leading to a democratic, non-racial South Africa
that would enhance long-term stability in the country

14

and the region. We are encouraged by the progress
that has’ been made, particularly the release of Nelson
Mandela and the unbanning of political organizations.
We look to all parties to continue to take the steps
necessary to create a climate in. which productive
negotiations can take place.

IV. Relating Means to Ends:

Our Political Agenda

The elements of our national power—diplomatic and
political, economic and military—remain formidable.
Yet, the relative importance of these different
instruments of policy will change in changing
circumstances. Our most difficult decisions will
include not only which military forces or programs to
adjust, increase, reduce or eliminate, but also which
risks can be ameliorated by means other than military
capability—means like negotiations, burdensharing,
economic and security assistance, economic leverage,
and political leadership.

In a new era, we foreseé that our military power will
remain an essential underpinning of the global bal-
ance, but less prominently and in different ways. We
see that the more likely demands for the use of our
military forces may not involve the Soviet Union and
may be in the Third World, where new capabilities
and approaches may be required. We see that we
must look to our economic well-being as the
foundation of our long-term strength. And we can see
that, especially in the new international environment,
political will and effective diplomacy can be what
translates national power into the achievement of
national objectives. While this Report necessarily
describes these different elements of policy separately,
national strategy must integrate them and wield them
according to a coherent vision.

Alliance Relationships

Our first priority in foreign policy remains solidarity
with our allies and friends. We have never been able
to “go it alone’, even in the early days of the Cold War
when our major allies were still suffering from the
devastation and exhaustion of World War il. Even to

 

attempt to do so would alter our way of life and
national institutions and would jeopardize the very
values we are seeking to protect.

The rise of other centers of power in the free world is
therefore welcome, consistent with America’s values,
and supportive of our national interests. We must
ensure that free nations continue to recognize the
fundamental moral, political, and security interests we
have in common and protect those interests against
both the residual threat of Soviet military power and
the emerging threats of regional conflict and of
divisive economic issues. We are prepared to share
more fully with our allies and friends the
responsibilities of global leadership.

Arms Control

Arms control is a means, not an end; it is an
important component of a broader policy to enhance
national security. We will judge arms control
agreements according to several fundamental criteria:

© First, agreements must add to our security. Our
objective is to reduce the incentives, even in crisis,
to initiate an attack. Thus, we seek not reductions
for reductions’ sake, but agreements that will
promote stability. We will work to reduce the
capabilities most suited for offensive action or pre-
emptive strike.

¢ Second, to enhance stability, we favor agreements
that lead to greater predictability in the size, nature,
and evolution of military forces. Predictability
through openness expands the traditional focus of
arms control beyond just military capabilities and
addresses the fear of aggressive intent.

15

 

 

 

© Third, agreements are effective only if we can
verify compliance. As we broaden our agenda to
include issues like chemical and missile
proliferation, verification will become’ an
increasingly difficult challenge, but effective
verification will still be required. We want
agreements that can endure.

* Finally, since the security of the United States is
indivisible from that of its friends and allies, we
will insist that any arms control agreements not
compromise allied security.

The arms control accomplishments of the past twelve
months are impressive. We have already reached a
number of new agreements with the Soviet Union on:

® prevention of dangerous military activities;
¢ advance notification of strategic exercises;

® clarification of the rights of innocent passage in
territorial seas;

* a memorandum of understanding implementing
verification provisions of the INF Treaty;

* trial verification and stability measures for Strategic
Arms Reduction Talks (START);

* reciprocal demonstrations of each side’s proposed
procedures for verifying re-entry vehicles on
ballistic missiles;

* reciprocal exhibitions of strategic bombers to aid
verification; and

¢ demonstrations of proposed “unique identifiers” or
“tags” for ballistic-missile verification.

These are but the beginning. Our arms control agenda
is now broader than ever—beyond the traditional East-
West focus on nuclear weapons. We are dealing with
pressing multilateral arms control issues. We are also
negotiating for greater transparency and for limits on
conventional arms. We will negotiate in good faith,
patiently and seriously, but we will not seek agree-
ment for agreement's sake, nor compromise the basic
principles set forth above.

16

 

Strategic Arms Reduction Talks
(START)

In START, our goals are not merely to reduce forces
but to reduce the risk of nuclear war and create a
more stable nuclear balance. Our proposals are
designed to strengthen deterrence by reducing and
constraining in particular those strategic nuclear forces
which pose the greatest threat—namely, ballistic
missiles, especially large CBMs with multiple ‘
warheads. We propose Jess strict limits on bombers
and cruise missiles, which are not capable of carrying
out a disarming first strike. Our goal is to resolve all
substantive START issues by the June 1990 Summit.

Defense and Space

Our approach to this set of issues, as well, is to
enhance strategic stability by facilitating a cooperative
transition to a stable balance of offensive and
defensive forces if effective defenses prove feasible.
We also seek greater transparency and predictability
in approaches to strategic defense, and have proposed
regular exchanges of data, briefings, visits to
laboratories, and observations of tests.

Conventional Armed Forces in Europe
(CFE)

The United States is firmly committed to reaching an

agreement to reduce conventional armed forces in

Europe to lower levels in order to enhance security

and stability and to reduce the ability to launch a

surprise attack or sustain large-scale offensive

operations. Our goal is to complete the CFE Treaty as

soon as possible this year. In my State of the Union :
speech, in response to rapid changes in Europe, | \
proposed to lower substantially the levels of U.S. and

Soviet ground and air force personnel in Central and

Eastern Europe—to 195,000 troops. This proposal has

been accepted.

Chemical Weapons

The Conference on Disarmament in Geneva continues
to work toward a global ban of chemical weapons,
using as the basis for its negotiations the draft text
that | personally presented for the United States in
1984. It is one of my most important goals to see an
effective, truly global ban of chemical weapons—their
production and possession, as well as their use. At

 

 

the United Nations and at Malta, | made several
suggestions and challenges to speed this negotiation
to a successful conclusion, including ways that the
United States and Soviet Union can set an example to
spur achievement of a global ban. In this connection,
we and the Soviets have agreed to work together to
sign a bilateral agreement at the June 1990 Summit
that would have each side destroy substantial
quantities of its chemical weapons stocks. We must
not only deal with those states that now possess
chemical weapons, but also address the growing
proliferation of these instruments of indiscriminate
destruction.

Open Skies

An important step in achieving predictability through
openness is the Open Skies initiative | made last May,
which would allow frequent unarmed observation
flights over the territory of participating states. This
would institutionalize openness on a truly
unprecedented scale. It would achieve greater
transparency about military activities, lessen danger,
and ease tension. The NATO allies agreed in
December on a common approach for pursuing this
initiative, and foreign ministers from NATO and the
Warsaw Pact have met in Ottawa to begin negotiating
an agreement.

Confidence- and Security-Building
Measures

These negotiations in Vienna are another important
opportunity to enhance free world security through a
variety of measures to codify openness and
transparency in military operations’ and force
structures. The recently completed seminar on military
doctrine is a powerful example of how this forum can
generate valuable exchanges among high-ranking
military officers and open up new avenues of
understanding.

Nuclear Testing

The United States and the Soviet Union are on the
verge of completing new verification protocols to the
1974 Threshold Test Ban and the 1976 Peaceful Nu-
clear Explosions Treaties that should open the way to
their ratification and entry into force. The protocols—
which | expect to be signed at the June 1990

 

Summit—involve new, complex, and unprecedented
techniques for effective verification, including direct,
on-site measurement of explosive yield.

Proliferation

The spread of ever more sophisticated weaponry —
including chemical, biological, and nuclear
weapons—and of the missiles capable of carrying
them represents a growing danger to international
security. This proliferation exacerbates and fuels
regional tensions and complicates U.S. defense
planning. It poses ever greater dangers to U.S. forces
and facilities abroad, and possibly even to the United
States itself.

Our comprehensive approach to this problem
includes stringent controls and multilateral
cooperation designed to stop the spread of these
technologies and components. We will work to
strengthen the International Atomic Energy Agency,
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the Missile
Technology Control Regime. We will also use
diplomacy and economic and security assistance to
address the underlying causes of tension or insecurity
that lead countries to seek advanced weaponry.

Naval Forces

The Soviet Union has urged that we negotiate
limitations on naval forces. We have rejected this pro-
posal for reasons grounded in the fundamental
realities of the free world’s strategic interests.

The economies of the United States and its major
allies depend so vitally on trade, and on the security
of sea lines of communication, that we have always
defined a vital interest in freedom of the seas for all
nations. Our Navy protects that interest. Similarly,
some of our most important security relations are with
nations across the oceans. The Soviet Union, as a
power on the Eurasian land mass not dependent on
overseas trade, with interior lines of communication
to its major allies and trading partners, has no such
strategic stake. Its navy has served the purposes of
coastal defense—or of denial of our ability to defend
our vital interests. There is no symmetry here.

Nor is our naval power to be equated with the Soviet
ground-force superiority that we are determined to
reduce—a superiority that in its very nature, scope,

17

 

and composition has posed an offensive threat. No
navy could pose such a threat to the Soviet Union.

The Contest of Ideas and the
Nurturing of Democracy

Since the end of World War II, the United States has
developed and maintained an extensive program of
public information around the world—through U.S.
Information Agency offices at our embassies, speakers,
publications, exchange programs, cultural centers, and
numerous other activities.

A special effort has been made to reach into closed
societies with information about their countries,
factual news of the world, and insight into American
society. Primary tools for this effort are the Voice of
America, Radio Liberty, and Radio Free Europe. Their
impact has been invaluable, and has contributed
significantly to the changes now taking place in the
Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere.

The American message of democracy, respect for
human rights, and the free flow of ideas is as crucial
and inspiring today as it was forty-five years ago. The
truth we provide remains a stimulus to openness. In
the coming decade, we will have to project American
values and protect American interests on issues of
growing global. importance, such as the battle against
narcotics trafficking and the search for solutions to
international environmental problems.

An American initiative begun in the 1980s—the
National Endowment for Democracy —has broken new
ground, mobilizing the private efforts of our political
parties, labor unions, businesses, educational and
other organizations in fostering the development of
democratic institutions. As democratic change
continues around the world—and is sti!l denied in
many places—we must ensure that the message we
send and the means of delivery we use keep pace.

Economic and Security
Assistance

Our foreign assistance has traditionally supported our

18

 

security objectives by strengthening allies and friends,
bolstering regional security, deterring conflict, and
securing base rights and access.

As East-West tensions diminish, these political and
economic instruments become more centrally relevant
to an era of new challenges:

¢ A multipolar world, in which military factors may
recede to the background, puts a new premium on
the instrumentalities of political relations—of which
foreign assistance has been one of the most cost-
effective and valuable.

¢ In a new era, nurturing democracy and stability
remains a basic goal, but one now freed from its
traditional Cold War context. Foreign assistance is
an indispensable means toward this end.

Economic and humanitarian goals~such as
promoting market-oriented structural reforms in

Eastern Europe and the developing world, or aiding .

refugees and disaster victims —will also loom larger
than before. This is a responsibility we need to
share with international financial institutions and
prosperous allies, but we need to do our part.

* As regional conflicts are resolved, United Nations
peacekeeping takes on additional tasks—and will
have a claim on our support. As for those conflicts
that continue to fester, security assistance can re-
duce the level or likelihood of a direct U.S. role in
bolstering regional security.

* On problems such as drugs, the environment,
terrorism, or the proliferation of high-tech
weaponry, U.S. aid remains a-valuable tool of
policy.

These policy instruments in our International Affairs
budget have always struggled for survival in the
congressional budget process. Low funding and
excessive earmarking and conditionality have
hampered flexibility. In the 1990s, we will need to do
justice to the growing needs of the emerging East
European democracies without validating the fears of
our Third World friends that they will be relegated to
second place. A national security strategy that takes us
beyond containment needs these tools more than
ever.

 

 

Military Openness

In addition to the confidence-building measures
discussed above, our policy seeks other ways of
changing East-West military relations toward our goal
of greater transparency. A prudent program of
military-to-military contacts can demonstrate the
capabilities of our forces while allowing us greater
access to and understanding of the military
establishments of potential adversaries. This can re-
duce worst-case planning based on limited
information and reduce the likelihood of
miscalculation or dangerous military incidents.

As the Soviet political system evolves, we hope that
Soviet military power will increasingly be subject to

detailed and searching public debate. In the long
term, a Soviet military that must justify its size,
mission, and resource demands to the Soviet public
and legislature will find it more difficult to enhance
its capabilities beyond the legitimate needs of de-
fense. Increased contact with the armed forces of the
United States and other democracies can aid this
process as well as contribute to greater understanding.
We will continue to pursue the kinds of contacts first
agreed to by Admiral Crowe and Marshal
Akhromeyev in 1988. We will also pursue similar
exchanges with the armed forces of Eastern European
states. In addition to their obvious contributions to
transparency, such contacts will support our overall
approach to Eastern Europe by helping the military
officers of these states establish a professional identity
independent of their roles in the Warsaw Pact.

19

 

V. Relating Means to Ends:
Our Economic Agenda

America’s national power continues to rest on the
strength and resilience of our economy. To retain a
position of international leadership, we need not only
skitled diplomacy and strong military forces, but also
a dynamic economic base with competitive
agricultural and manufacturing sectors, an innovative
research establishment, solid infrastructure, secure
supplies of energy, and vibrant financial and service
industries.

We will pursue a strategy that integrates domestic
economic policies with a market-opening trade policy,
enhanced cooperation among the major industrial
countries, and imaginative solutions to the problems
of the Third World.

Global Imbalances

Japan and Germany continue to run substantial trade
and current account surpluses; the United States has
large deficits. Recent economic summits and meetings
of finance ministers of the Group of Seven (G-7) have
given high priority to reducing these imbalances. For
deficit countries like the United States, this requires
action to reduce budget deficits and encourage private
savings. The surplus countries like Germany and Japan
should, for their part, pursue macro-economic policies
and structural reforms to encourage non-inflationary
growth. Through the G-7 and economic summits, we
will strengthen coordination and ensure
implementation of appropriate policies for non-
inflationary growth and expanded trade.

 

Debt

Aggregate Third World debt is over $1 trillion, and
debtor nations need some $70 billion just to meet
annual interest payments. It is a tremendous burden
on struggling democracies and on the ability of many
friendly countries to maintain their security. Relatively
slow world growth, growing inflation, rising
unemployment, and the failure to implement
necessary economic reforms aggravate an already diffi-
cult situation. We have advanced, in the Brady Plan,
suggestions to revitalize the international debt strategy
through reductions in commercial bank debt and debt
service payments, as a complement to new lending.
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
will provide financial support for these efforts. As an
essential first step in obtaining this support, we are
urging debtors to adopt medium-term economic
programs—including measures to strengthen domestic
savings, steps to attract foreign investment, and
policies that promote the return of flight capital.

Trade

Support within the United States for free trade has
weakened as a result of persistently high trade deficits.
Additional concern about the competitiveness of the
U.S, economy has led to increased calls for
government intervention in support of key sectors.
Current account and trade deficits are macroeconomic

‘21

 

 

phenomena that primarily reflect domestic savings
and investment. The imbalance between the U.S.
saving rate and the higher U.S. investment rate is,
therefore, the fundamental source of the U.S. trade
deficit. The net capital inflow into the United States,
which is necessary to finance the deficit, must be
matched by a corresponding increase in imports to
the United States over exports to other countries. The
key to reducing the deficit, therefore, is to increase
domestic saving, thus closing the savings-investment
gap and reducing import demand. We have proposed
a comprehensive Savings and Economic Growth Act
to raise household savings which will help to restore
necessary balance in the trade and current accounts.

While addressing the domestic causes for the trade
deficit, we must also ensure that market forces are
free to operate at home and abroad, and that trade
expands—rather than closing our markets. In this re-
gard, we will work with other members of GATT to
bring to a successful conclusion this year the Uruguay
Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations now
addressing issues crucial to our interests, including
agricultural subsidies, services, the protection of
intellectual property, trade-related investment
measures, and market access. These are the trade
problems of the 1990s that require solution if we are
to maintain a domestic consensus in support of free
and open trade.

Given the continuing strategic importance of unity

among the industrial democracies, it is essential that
trade disputes be resolved equitably, without tearing
the fabric of vital political and security partnerships.

Technology

Our economic and military strength rests on our
technological superiority, not sheer manufacturing
might. The United States remains in the forefront in
the development of new technologies, but American
enterprises must respond more quickly in their
exploitation of new technologies if they are to
maintain their competitiveness in both domestic and
foreign markets. The loss of advanced production
capabilities in key industries could place our
manufacturing base in jeopardy.

22

 

The dynamics of the technological revolution
transcend national boundaries. The transfer of
technology between allies and friends has benefitted
the United States in both national security and
economic terms. Open markets and open investment
policies will best ensure that scarce resources are
used efficiently and that benefits are widely shared.
But the openness of the free market economy must
not be exploited to threaten our security. With our
partners in the Coordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), we must
continue to work tq ensure that militarily sensitive
technology does not flow to potential adversaries. At
the same time, we must adapt the procedures and
lists of COCOM-controlled goods to support rapid
political and economic change in Eastern Europe. In
that regard, our task is threefold: (a) streamline
COCOM controls on strategic goods and
technologies; (b) harmonize and tighten national
licensing and enforcement procedures; and (c)
encourage greater cooperation with non-COCOM
developing countries. We have also initiated a
comprehensive analysis of the changing strategic
threat, which will be instrumental in deciding on
possible further changes in the multilateral system of
strategic export controls.

Energy

Secure supplies of energy are essential to our
prosperity and security. The concentration of 65
percent of the world’s known oil reserves in the
Persian Gulf means we must continue to ensure
reliable access to competitively priced oil and a
prompt, adequate response to any major oil supply
disruption, We must maintain our Strategic Petroleum
Reserve at a level adequate to protect our economy
against a serious supply disruption. We will continue
to promote energy conservation and diversification of
oil and gas sources, while expanding our total supply
of energy to meet the needs of a growing economy.
We must intensify efforts to promote alternative
sources of energy (nuclear, natural gas, coal, and
renewables), and devote greater attention to reducing
fossil fuel emissions in light of growing environmental
concerns.

 

 

VI. Relating Means to Ends:

Our Defense Agenda

One reason for the success of America’s grand strategy
of containment has been its consistency. The military
component of that strategy has been adjusted to
changing threats and available military technology, but
there too substantial continuity remains:

© Deterrence: Throughout the postwar period we have
deterred aggression and coercion against the United
States and its allies by persuading potential adver-
saties that the costs of aggression, either nuclear or
conventional, would exceed any possible gain.
“Flexible response” demands that we preserve
options for direct defense, the threat of escalation,
and the threat of retaliation.

© Strong Alliances: Shared values and common
security interests form the basis of our system of
collective security. Collective defense arrangements
allow us to combine our economic and military
strength, thus lessening the burden on any one
country,

© Forward Defense: In the postwar era, the defense of
these shared values and common interests has
required the forward presence of significant
American military forces in Europe, in Asia and the
Pacific, and at sea. These forces provide the
capability, with our allies, for early, direct defense
against aggression and serve as a visible reminder
of our commitment to the common effort.

¢ Force Projection: Because we have global security
interests, we have maintained ready forces in the
United States and the means to move them to
reinforce our units forward deployed or to project
power into areas where we have no permanent
presence. For the threat of protracted conflict we
have relied on the potential to mobilize the
manpower and industrial resources of the country.

 

These elements have been underwritten by advanced
weaponry, timely intelligence, effective and verifiable
arms control, highly qualified and trained personnel,
and a system for command and control that is
effective, survivable, and enduring. Together they have
formed the essence of our defense policy and military
strategy during the postwar era.

The rebuilding of America’s military strength during
the past decade was an essential underpinning to the
positive change we now see in the international
environment. Our challenge now is to adapt this
strength to a grand strategy that looks beyond
containment, and to ensure that our military power,
and that of our allies and friends, is appropriate to the
new and more complex opportunities and challenges
before us.

Overall Priorities

From the weapons, forces, and technologies that will
be available, we will have to pick carefully those that
best meet our needs and support our strategy in a
new period. Our approach will include the following
elements:

© Deterrence of nuclear attack remains the
cornerstone of U.S. national security. Regardless of
improved U.S-Soviet relations and potential arms
control agreements, the Soviets’ physical ability to
initiate strategic nuclear warfare against the United
States will persist and a crisis or political change in
the Soviet Union could occur faster than we could
rebuild neglected strategic forces. A START
agreement will allow us to adjust how we respond
to the requirements of deterrence, but tending to
those requirements remains the first priority of our
defense strategy.

23

 

 

© As we and our allies adjust our military posture,
each should emphasize retaining those roles it is
uniquely or better able to fulfill. For the United
States, these include nuclear and space forces,
advanced technologies, strategic mobility, a
worldwide presence, power projection, and a
secure mobilization base.

¢ As a country separated from many of its allies and
areas of interest by vast distances, we will ensure
we have those forces needed to control critical sea
and air lines of communication in crisis and war.

© U.S. technological superiority has long been a
powerful contributor to deterrence. To retain this
edge, we will sustain our investment in research
and development as an important hedge against an
uncertain future.

© We remain committed to the doctrine of
competitive strategies. | reaffirm the wisdom of
exploiting American strengths in a systematic way,
moving Soviet investment into areas that threaten
us less or negating systems that threaten us most.

© Defense investment faces a dual challenge: to
maintain sufficient forces to deter general war while
also giving us forces that are well suited for the
more likely contingencies of the Third World.
Many defense programs contribute significantly in
both environments but, where necessary, we will
develop the weaponry and force structure needed
for the special demands of the Third World even if
it means that some forces are less optimal for a
conflict on the European central front.

¢ As we make fundamental changes in our military
forces, we will preserve a capacity for reversibility.
This will affect decisions on a variety of issues and
may, in the short run, reduce the amount of savings
we might otherwise see. But it is a prudent hedge
against future uncertainty, which it is my moral and
constitutional duty to provide.

Deterring Nuclear War

Strategic Offensive Forces

The Soviet Union continues to modernize its strategic
forces across the board. Even as START promises to
reduce numbers substantially, the qualitative
competition has not ended.

24

 

Decisions on strategic modernization that | have
already made take advantage of the most promising
technologies in each leg of our Triad to increase
stability. The B-2 bomber will ensure our ability to
penetrate Soviet defenses and fulfill the role the
bomber force has played so successfully for forty
years. The D-5 missile in Trident submarines will
exploit the traditionally high survivability of this leg
and add a significant ability to attack more hardened
targets. In a two-phase program for our ICBM force,
the deployment of the Rail Garrison System will
enhance stability by removing Peacekeeper missiles
from vulnerable silos and providing the mobile
capability we need for the near term. In the second
phase, deployment of the small ICBM road-mobile
system will further strengthen stability and increase
force flexibility.

While we will ensure that each leg of the Triad is as
survivable as possible, the existence of all three
precludes the destruction of more than one by
surprise attack and guards against a technological
surprise that could undermine a single leg.

Strategic Defenses

Flexible response and deterrence through the threat of
retaliation have preserved the security of the United
States and its allies for decades. Looking to the future,
the Strategic Defense Initiative offers an opportunity to
shift deterrence to a safer and more stable basis
through greater reliance on strategic defenses. In a
new international environment, as ballistic-missile
capabilities proliferate, defense against third-country
threats.also becomes an increasingly important
benefit.

The deterrent value of strategic defenses derives from
the effect they would have on an adversary’s calcula-
tions. Even an initial deployment would influence an
attacker's calculation by diminishing his confidence in
his ability to execute an effective attack. Initial strate-
gic defenses would also offer the United States and its
allies some protection should deterrence fail or in the
event of an accidental launch. Follow-on deployments
incorporating more advanced technologies could
provide progressively more capable defenses, even in
the face of countermeasures.

We continue to seek with the Soviet Union a
cooperative transition to deployed defenses and

 

 

reductions in strategic offensive arms. Strategic
defenses can protect our security against possible
violations of agreements to reduce strategic offensive
weapons.

The Soviets have stated that they are no longer
making completion and implementation of a START
treaty contingent on a Defense and Space Agreement
restricting SDI. A START Treaty should stand on its
own merits and we will preserve our right to conduct
SDI activities consistent with the Anti-Ballistic Missile
(ABM) Treaty and our option to deploy SDI when it is
ready. And we will use the Defense and Space Talks
to explore a cooperative and stable transition to a
greater reliance on stability-enhancing, cost-effective
strategic defenses.

Theater Nuclear Forces

The Atlantic Alliance has consistently followed the
principle of maintaining survivable and credible thea-
ter nuclear forces to ensure a robust deterrent, to
execute its agreed strategy of flexible response—and
to “couple” European defense to the strategic nuclear
guarantee of the United States. At the same time, we
have always pursued a nuclear force that is as small
as is consistent with its tasks and objectives. Indeed,
NATO has unilaterally reduced its theater nuclear
weapons by over one-third during the past decade—
over and above the entire class of U.S. and Soviet
nuclear weapons eliminated by the INF Treaty. As
requirements change, we will continue to ensure that
our posture provides survivability and credibility at
the lowest possible levels. The United States believes
that for the foreseeable future, even,in a new
environment of reduced conventional forces and
changes in Eastern Europe, we Will need to retain
modern nuclear forces in-theater.

Command, Control and
Communications

Another basic element of deterrence is the security of
our command and control, enhancing the certainty of
retaliation. In addition, we maintain programs to
ensure the continuity of constitutional government—
another way of convincing a potential attacker that
any attempted “decapitating” strike against our
political and military leadership will fail.

 

Deterring Conventional War

It is clear that the United States must retain the full
range of conventional military capabilities,
appropriately balanced among combat and support
elements, U.S.- and forward-based forces, active and
reserve components. We must also maintain properly
equipped and well trained general purpose and
special operations forces. Within these requirements,
as we look to the future, we see our active forces
being smaller, more global in their orientation, and
having a degree of agility, readiness and sustainability
appropriate to the demands of likely conflicts.

Forward Defense through Forward
Presence

American leadership in the postwar world and our
commitment to the forward defense of our interests
and those of our allies have been underwritten by the
forward presence of U.S. military forces. We have
exerted this presence through forces permanently
stationed abroad; through a network of bases, °
facilities, and logistics arrangements; and through the
operational presence provided by periodic patrols,
exercises, and visits of U.S. military units. Clearly, the
mix of these elements will change as our perception
of the threat changes, as technology improves the
capabilities and reach of our military forces, and as
allies assume greater responsibilities in our common
efforts. But our forward presence will remain a critical
part of our defense posture for the foreseeable future.
Our overseas bases serve as an integral part of our
alliances and foster cooperation against common
threats. There is no better assurance of a U.S. security
commitment than the presence of U.S. forces.

There are growing pressures for change in our global
deployments, however. Some are caused by concerns
at home over an inequitable sharing of the defense
burden, and others in host countries emanate from
nationalism, anti-nuclear sentiment, environmental
and social concerns and honestly divergent interests.
Operational restrictions on our forces overseas are
also increasing, some of which we can accommodate
with new training and technologies, but others of
which may eventually reduce the readiness of our
deployed units.

25

 

 

 

In Europe, the overall level and specific contribution
of U.S. forces are not etched in stone, but we will
maintain forces in Europe—ground, sea and air,
conventional and nuclear—for as long as they are
needed and wanted, as | have pledged. Our forces in
Europe contribute in many ways to stability and
security. They are not tied exclusively to the size of
the Soviet presence in Eastern Europe, but to the
overall Alliance response to the needs of security. For
the foreseeable future, we believe a level of 195,000
U.S. troops in Central Europe is appropriate for
maintaining stability after a CFE reduction.

We also recognize that the presence of our forces
creates burdens that are part of the overall sharing of
effort within the Alliance. Consistent with the
demands of readiness, we will work to adjust our
training and other activities to ease the burden they
impose.

Outside of Europe, we will maintain the ability to re-
spond to regional crises, to support our commitments,
and to pursue our security interests. Within that
policy, adjustments in our overseas presence ‘will be
made. Yet—even as the total number of U.S. forward-
deployed forces is reduced—we will work to preserve
a U.S. presence where needed. And, where
appropriate, we will work to ensure continued access
to facilities that will permit a prompt return of U.S.
forces should they be required. As we negotiate for
the use of overseas bases, we will also proceed from
the realistic premise that no- base is irreplaceable.
While some are preferred more than others, each
makes a Jimited contribution to our strategy.

Sharing the Responsibilities of
Collective Defense

The success of our postwar strategy has enabled allied
and friendly nations’ economies and societies to
flourish. We now look to them to assume a greater
share in providing for our common security. Our
efforts in this regard will be integrated with our plans
for future force structure, weapons modernization, and
arms control. Above all, they must not be—nor be
perceived to be—a cover for “burden shedding”.

Our deliberations will be less about different ways to
calculate defense burdens and more about increasing
overall capabilities. One promising approach is a
greater commitment to national specialization, an

26

 

improved intra-alliance division of labor based on the
comparative advantages of different allies in different
defense activities. Such an approach could reduce the
impact of budget constraints being felt by us all.
Significant adjustments in missions and national force
structures may be possible as part of major negotiated
force reductions, such as those envisioned by CFE.
The overall destruction of equipment and the
possibility of “cascading” newer items from one
Alliance member to another (while destroying older,
less capable models) may give us opportunities for
greater efficiencies and new forms of Alliance
cooperation. These are complex issues, however, and
any steps will have to be sensitive to issues of
national sovereignty and based on an Alliance-wide
consensus.

As a part of burdensharing, the United States will
continue to ask our economically stronger allies to
increase aid to other Alliance members and to
friendly Third World countries. As another element of
burdensharing, the United States will work with allies
to broaden the regional role of our forward-deployed
forces, This will help us deal with the challenge of
maintaining sufficient forces for local defense and the
forces for likely contingencies elsewhere—a challenge
that will grow as defense resources become more
constrained. In support of this objective, we will make
forward-deployed forces more mobile and flexible so
they can assume broader regional responsibilities in
addition to deterring attack in the country in which
they are located.

Forces for the Third World

Since World War II, the threat posed by the Soviet
Union has dominated much of our planning for the
Third World. But we have also worked to preserve
peace and build democracy and we have long
identified specific interests independent of a Soviet
factor. In the future, we expect that non-Soviet threats
to these interests will command even greater attention.

To the degree possible, we will support allied and
friendly efforts rather than introduce U.S. forces.
Nonetheless, we must retain the capability to act ei-
ther in concert with our allies or, if necessary,
unilaterally where our vital interests are threatened.

The growing technological sophistication of Third
World conflicts will place serious demands on our
forces. They must be able to respond quickly, and

 

 

 

appropriately, as the application of even smal!
amounts of power early in a crisis usually pays
significant dividends. Some actions may require
considerable staying power, but there are likely to be
situations where American forces will have to succeed
rapidly and with a minimum of casualties. Forces will
have to accommodate to the austere environment,
immature basing structure, and significant ranges often
encountered in the Third World. The logistics “tail” of
deployed forces will also have to be kept to a
minimum, as an overly large American presence
could be self-defeating. These capabilities will
sometimes be different from those of a force
optimized for a conflict in Europe, and—as our
understanding of the threat there evolves—we will
make the necessary adjustments.

We will also try to involve other industrial
democracies in preventing and resolving Third World
conflicts. Some of our Atlantic allies have strong
political, economic, cultural, and military ties with
Third World countries, and Japan provides
considerable sums of aid. Their role will become
even more important in the future.

The Mobilization Base

The United States has never maintained active forces
in peacetime adequate for all the possible
contingencies we could face in war. We have instead
relied on reserve forces and on a pool of manpower
and industrial strength that we could mobilize to deal
with emergencies beyond the capabilities of our
active units.

For almost two decades, our Total Force policy has
placed a significant portion of our total military power
in a well-equipped, well-trained, and early-mobilizing
reserve component. Various elements of that policy—
the balance between active and reserve forces, the
mix of units in the two components, the nature of
missions given reserve forces—are likely to be
adjusted as we respond to changes in the security
environment. Reserve forces are. generally less
expensive to maintain than their active counterparts
so, as we adjust force structures, retaining reserve
units is one alternative for reducing costs while still
hedging against uncertainties. It is an alternative we
must thoroughly explore, especially as we better
understand the amount of warning time we can
expect for a major conflict.

 

A credible industrial mobilization capability

‘contributes to deterrence and alliance solidarity by

demonstrating to adversaries and friends alike that we
are able to meet our commitments. While important
progress has been made in recent years, more can be
done to preserve our ability to produce the weapons
and equipment we need. Mobilization plans will also
have to reflect our changing understanding of warning
for a global war and develop graduated responses that
will themselves signal U.S resolve and thus contribute
to deterrence.

Chemical Warfare

Our primary goal is to achieve an effective, truly
global ban on chemical weapons as soon as possible.
Until such a ban is achieved, the United States will
retain a small but effective chemical weapons
stockpile to deter the use of chemical weapons
against us and our allies. We will also continue our
initiatives to protect our forces from chemical agents
that could be used against them and to minimize the
impact of being forced to operate in a chemical
environment.

We will never use chemical weapons first, but only in
retaliation for their use against us. For as long as we
retain a chemical weapons deterrent, we will ensure
that it is as safe and effective as possible.

Space

The United States remains committed to the
exploration and use of space for peaceful purposes
and the benefit of all mankind, but international law
and this commitment allow for activities to protect our
national security. Our objectives for space mirror
those which we have long held for the sea—to ensure
free access for all in time of peace, but to be able to
deny access to our enemies in time of war.

Our space activities will help deter and, if necessary,
defend against enemy attack. We will maintain
assured access to space and negate, if necessary, hos-
tile space systems. We will develop, acquire, and
deploy systems for communications, navigation,
environmental monitoring, early warning, surveillance,
and treaty verification.

27

 

We wil! also pursue scientific, technological, and
economic benefit—including encouraging private
sector investment. We will promote international
cooperative activities and work with others to
maintain freedom in space.

We remain dedicated to expanding human presence
and activity beyond earth orbit and into the solar
system. In July | committed the United States to return
to the moon, this time to stay, and continue with a
journey to Mars. The first step in this bold program to
strengthen our position of space leadership will be
completion of Space Station Freedom in the 1990s.

| chartered the National Space Council, chaired by
Vice President Quayle, to develop national space
policy, advise me on space matters, and ensure that

' policy guidance is carried out. | have also asked the
Vice President, as Chairman of the Council, to assess
the feasibility of international cooperation in human
exploration. Equally important, | announced our
commitment to use space to address critical
environmental problems on earth. The new Mission to
Planet Earth program, a major part of a
comprehensive research effort, will use space
platforms to gather the data we need to determine
what changes are taking place in the global
environment.

The National Space Council also provides a high-level
focus for commercial space issues. Consistent with
national security and safety, an expanding private
sector role in space can generate economic benefits
for the nation.

Low-Intensity Conflict

Even as the threat of East-West conflict may be
diminishing in a new era, lower-order threats like
terrorism, subversion, insurgency, and drug trafficking
are menacing the United States, its citizenry, and its
interests in new ways.

Low-intensity conflict involves the struggle of
competing principles and ideologies below the level
of conventional war. Poverty and the lack of political
freedoms contribute to the instability that breeds such
conflict. Our response must address these underlying
conditions—but we cannot accept violence against

28

 

 

our interests, or even less against innocent civilians,
as a legitimate instrument of anyone's policy. Nor can
the ideals of democracy, freedom, or economic
progress be nurtured except in an environment of
security.

It is the primary responsibility of friendly nations to
protect their own interests. Our security assistance
programs are a crucial tool with which we can help
them help themselves. In some cases, security
assistance ought to assyme the same priority as
resources devoted to our own forces.

It is not possible to prevent or deter conflict at the
lower end of the conflict spectrum in the same way
or to the same degree as at the higher. American
forces therefore must be capable of dealing effectively
with the full range of threats, including insurgency
and terrorism. Special Operations Forces have
particular utility in this environment, but we will also
pursue new and imaginative ways to apply flexible
general purpose forces to these problems. We will
improve the foreign language skills and cultural
orientation of our armed forces and adjust our
intelligence activities to better serve our needs. Units
with unique capabilities in this environment will
receive increased emphasis. Training and research and
development will be better attuned to the needs of
low-intensity conflict.

Drug Trafficking

The Department of Defense, as noted earlier, has an
important role to play in our National Drug Control
Strategy in coordination with the Department of State
and law enforcement agencies.

The first line of defense against the illegal flow of
drugs is at the source—in those countries where illicit
drugs are produced and processed before being sent
to the United States and other countries. Our policy is
to strengthen the political will and institutional
capability of host-country military, judicial, and law
enforcement agencies. Training and material
assistance help improve tactical intelligence and the
ability to conduct airmobile and riverine operations.
Security assistance also provides host countries with
the resources needed to confront the insurgency
threats that often are endemic to narcotics-producing
regions.

 

 

A second line of defense involves the deployment of
appropriate elements of the U.S. Armed Forces with
the primary role of detecting and monitoring the
transportation of drugs to the U.S. border. The
Secretary of Defense has directed several regional
commanders to support these objectives with their
own programs and operations. As a high priority, our
military counter-narcotics deployments will focus on
the flow of drugs—especially cocaine—across the
Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico toward the
southern border of the United States. These
deployments will support U.S. law enforcement
agencies in their efforts to apprehend traffickers and
seize drug shipments.

Our military and foreign intelligence activities must
be coordinated with our own and host-country law
enforcement agencies to identify air and maritime
smuggling vessels as well as the networks that
facilitate and manage illicit drug trafficking. This
cooperation and coordination must be extended to
the operational level to ensure timely and effective
interdiction.

Current efforts are already bearing fruit. Our
assistance to the Colombian government has aided its
courageous campaign to strike back at the drug lords
and to reestablish national sovereignty and the rule of
law. The cocaine industry in the Andean region has
been disrupted, and sustained pressure and
cooperation will erode the strength of the drug
trafficking organizations. The United States is
committed to such a sustained international effort.

Intelligence Programs

The extraordinary changes taking place in the world
are posing an almost unprecedented challenge to our
intelligence assets and programs.

The changes in East-West relations point to a more
peaceful future. But—after four decades of
confrontation—achieving mutual trust will be a diffi-
cult task of confidence-building and verification. A
time of transition can also be a time of turbulence. It
will be critical that we be well informed of events
and intentions in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe,
and elsewhere.

 

In a new period, intelligence must also focus on new
issues. Within the Communist world, for example,
economic questions take on new importance. As
economic forces are the impetus for many of the
military and political changes taking place there,
economic change can be a valuable gauge of how
much real change is occurring. The extent to which
Soviet leaders actually shift resources from military
to civilian uses, for example, will be an important
strategic indicator.

In contrast to the hopeful trends in the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe, there are danger signs
elsewhere—as this Report has noted. The proliferation
of nuclear, chemical, and other military technologies
taises the risks of conflict and crisis. Regional conflicts
continue to fester. U.S. intelligence must monitor such
developments and provide policymakers with the
information needed to protect American interests.

The twin scourges of international terrorism and
narcotics trafficking also pose very high-priority, but
non-traditional, intelligence requirements. We will
also have to adapt to a new emphasis on broader
global economic and trade issues. We must be more
fully aware of such subjects as foreign trade policies,
economic trends, and foreign debt.

U.S. counterintelligence must be responsive to a
changing hostile intelligence threat. Historically,
foreign Bovernments—and to some extent foreign
businesses—have tried to obtain our secrets and
technologies. Hostile intelligence efforts are not likely
to decrease in the near term, and they may actually
increase as barriers to contact come down.

U.S. intelligence must still be the “alarm bell” to give

us early warning of new developments and new

dangers even as requirements grow in number and

complexity. Our intelligence capabilities must be

ready to meet new challenges, to adapt as necessary, :
and to support U.S. policy in the 1990s.

Planning for the Future

United States military planning in the postwar era has
been dominated by the need to deter and be able to
defend against overwhelming Warsaw Pact
conventional! forces in Europe. As this Report has
described, this heretofore dominant reality is

29

 

undergoing significant change, both through Soviet
and other Warsaw Pact unilateral reductions and
through negotiated agreements. This prospect is
clearly affecting our military planning.

Such planning need not and cannot. await the entry
into force of arms reduction treaties: We will not act
merely on the promise of change in Warsaw Pact

30

forces, but neither will we delay developing our
résponses to those changes until their implementation
is upon us. We will continually review important
issues like the future demands of nuclear deterrence,
the proper role and mix of our general purpose
forces, and an'improved and more effective security
assistance program.

 

 

Vil. A Public Trust

As our defense efforts adapt to changing circum-
stances, our people must be confident that their
defense dollars are efficiently and effectively
supporting the cause of peace.

The Defense Management
Review

Shortly after | took office, | ordered a review of
defense management structures and practices in
order to improve defense acquisition, to implement
the excellent recommendations of the Packard
Commission, and to manage Department of Defense
resources more effectively. Secretary Cheney
completed a preliminary report and forwarded it to
me in July, along with a commitment to implement its
findings. | subsequently forwarded the report to the
Congressional leadership, giving its recommendations
my strong personal endorsement and asking for
Congressional support in implementation.

The implementation process now underway provides
for continuous improvement in several areas of
defense management.

Reducing Overhead Costs While
Maintaining Military Strength

The Department of Defense is building a significantly
more streamlined acquisition structure with clear lines
of responsibility and authority. The Services’ systems
and materiel commands are being reorganized to
focus largely on logistics and support services. Nearly
all contract administration services, currently divided
among the Military Departments and the Defense
Logistics Agency (DLA), are being consolidated under

se aitnalbeae!

 

DLA. {n addition, a Corporate Information
Management initiative is underway to develop more
efficient data processing and information systems.

Enhancing Program Performance

The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition will |
have an enhanced role and will discipline programs P
through a revised and strengthened acquisition proc-

ess. Programs will have to achieve defined milestones

and satisfy specific criteria before moving to the next

phase of their development. The military departments

will create a corps of officers who will make

acquisition a full-time career. These and additional

steps will lead to a simplified acquisition structure,

run by well-trained, dedicated professionals able to

perform their work with a minimum of bureaucratic

distraction.

Reinvigorating Planning and Budgeting

The Secretary of Defense now chairs a new Executive
Committee to’ review overall Department policies and
permit regular and confidential exchanges on key
issues among the Departments senior leadership. In
addition, the Deputy Secretary manages a revitalized
planning, programming, and budgeting system as
Chairman of the Defense Planning and Resources
Board. With steps such as these, the senior leadership
in the Department is now engaged in a dynamic
planning process that will improve the linkage
between policy, strategy, programs, and budgets.

Reducing Micromanagement

The Department of Defense has begun to carve away
a bewildering maze of self-imposed regulations. A
new, streamlined set of directives will be issued this
summer in a form that permits action at the working
level, with little additional policy guidance. The

31

 

 

Secretary of Defense, with my full indorsement, has
called on Congress to work with the Administration
to review and overhaul the statutory framework for
defense acquisition and improve the process by
which Congress oversees the Department.

Strengthening the Defense Industrial
Base

The defense industrial base must be strong, and
include manufacturers that are highly flexible and
technologically advanced. This will require that both
the Defense Department and industry maintain active
research programs in vital technologies. The
Department must also create incentives (and eliminate
disincentives) to invest in new facilities and
equipment as well as in research and development.
This will be especially important in an era when
overall procurements are likely to decline.

Improving the Observance of Ethical
Standards

Secretary Cheney has chartered a high-level Ethics
Council to develop ethics programs for the
Department. The Council has met and directed work
on a model ethics program, a Department-wide Ethics
Conference, and a review of existing compliance
programs. The goal is to strengthen ethical standards
within government and with industry and to create an
environment where official standards of conduct are
well understood, broadly observed, and vigorously
enforced.

The strength of this effort to improve defense
management is that it is largely a product of the
Department itself, not something forced on it from
outside. The dedicated people—both civilian and
military—who have developed the changes described
above will be the same people called upon to make
these changes work. These are not quick fixes but
fundamental shifts, “cultural” changes, that address
issues at the core of defense management. While we
are proud of the accomplishments to date, fully

32

 

achieving these ambitious objectives will require
several years of significant effort.

Congress and the American
People

Under our Constitution, responsibility for national de-
fense is shared between the executive and legislative
branches of our federal, government. The President,
for example, is commander-in-chief, while Congress
has the power to raise and support armies and
declare war. This system of shared and separated
powers is well designed to guard against abuses of
power, but it works best in the demanding
environment of national security affairs only if there is
a spirit of cooperation between the two branches and,
indeed, a strong measure of national and bipartisan
consensus on basic policy.

| am proud of the successful examples of bipartisan
cooperation in the past year—on Central America, on
aid to Eastern Europe, on Panama, to name a few. Yet
other issues remain contentious, such as various
attempts to constrict Presidential discretion and
authority in fields ranging from covert actions to the
excessive earmarking of assistance funds. If we are to
make a successful transition to a new era, we need to
work together.

We are now in an era of rapidly changing strategic
conditions, new openings for peace, continuing
uncertainties, and new varieties of danger. We thus
face new opportunities and new problems, both of
which demand of us special qualities of leadership—
boldness, vision, and constancy. It is my responsibility
to meet that challenge, and | am prepared to meet it
in a spirit of close cooperation and consultation with
Congress. | believe there is a national consensus in
support of a strong foreign and defense policy—
perhaps broader and deeper than at any time in 25
years. Congress and the President need, more than
ever, to reflect that unity in their own cooperation.
We owe the American people no less.

Preface

A NEW WORLD ORDER

A new world order is not a fact; it is an aspiration —
and an opportunity. We have within our grasp an
extraordinary possibility that few generations have
enjoyed — to build a new international system in
accordance with our own values and ideals, as old pat-
terns and certainties crumble around us.

In the Gulf we caught a glimmer of a better future — a
new world community brought together by a growing
consensus that force cannot be used to settle disputes
and that when that consensus is broken, the world will
respond. In the Gulf, we saw the United Nations play-
ing the role dreamed of by its founders, with the
world’s leading nations orchestrating and sanctioning
collective action against aggression. But we remain in a
period of transition. The old has been swept away, the
new not yet fully in place. The obstacles and uncertain-
ties before us are quite real — the daunting problems
confronting the hopes for reform in Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union, trade disputes and burdensharing
debates among the industrial democracies, and the tur-
moil and dangers in the developing world.

Yet, the Gulf crisis showed what the world community
is now capable of, and in the very act of meeting that
challenge the world community strengthened itself. |
hope history will record that the Gulf crisis was the
crucible of the new world order.

It is up to us — our generation in America and the
world — to bring these extraordinary possibilities to
fruition. And in doing this, American leadership is
indispensable. That is our challenge.

 

 

 

Our response, outlined in this Report, is shaped by
what we are as a people, for our values are the link
between our past and our future, between our domestic
life and our foreign policy, between our power and our
purpose. It is our deepest belief that all nations and
peoples seek political and economic freedom; that gov-
ernments must rest their rightful authority on the con-
sent of the governed, and must live in peace with their
neighbors. The collapse of the Communist idea has
shown that our vision of individual rights —- a vision
imbedded in the faith of our Founders — speaks to
humanity’s enduring hopes and aspirations.

It is this abiding faith in democracy that steels us to
deal with a world that, for all our hope, remains a dan-
gerous place — a world of ethnic antagonisms, nation-
al rivalries, religious tensions, spreading weaponry, per-
sonal ambitions and lingering authoritarianism. For
America, there can be no retreat from the world’s prob-
lems. Within the broader community of nations, we see
our own role clearly. We must not only protect our citi-
zens and our interests, but help create a new world in
which our fundamental values not only survive but
flourish. We must work with others, but we must also
be a leader.

Dural.

 

 

I. The Foundations of National
Strategy: Interests and Goals

NEW ERA

The bitter struggle that divided the world for over two
generations has come to an end. The collapse of Soviet
domination in Eastern Europe means that the Cold War
is over, its core issue resolved. We have entered a new
era, one whose outline would have been unimaginable
only three years ago.

This new era offers great hope, but this hope must be
tempered by the even greater uncertainty we face.
Almost immediately new crises and instabilities came
upon us. The Gulf War was a forceful reminder that
there are still autonomous sources of turbulence in the
world. In the Soviet Union, while we have seen a
healthy retrenchment in foreign policy, we also see a
continuing internal crisis, with a danger of violence
overhanging the hopes for internal reform. We face
new challenges not only to our security, but to our
ways of thinking about security.

For over 40 years, the American grand strategy of con-
tainment has reflected an era of expanding Soviet
power, Soviet aggression and Soviet Communism. We
now find, however, that the Soviet Union is far more
inwardly focused as it wrestles with its internal crises.
We do not know what path the Soviet Union will ulti-
mately take, but a return to the same superpower
adversary we have faced for over 40 years is unlikely.

That said, the Soviet Union remains the only state pos-
sessing the physical military capability to destroy
American society with a single, cataclysmic attack and,
in spite of severe economic strains, the modernization
of Soviet strategic forces continues virtually across the
board. Even with a START Treaty, the Soviets will retain
more than 6,000 strategic weapons. The Soviets will

 

 

also — despite the heartening reductions we have seen
in their conventional capabilities — retain some three
million men in their armed forces. These enduring real-
ities cannot be ignored.

Shaping a security strategy for a new era will require an
understanding of the extraordinary trends at work today
— a clear picture of what has changed and what has
not, an accurate sense of the opportunities that history
has put before us and a sober appreciation of the dan-
gers that remain.

Politically, a key issue is how America’s role of alliance
leader — and indeed our alliances themselves — will
be affected, especially in Europe, by a reduced Soviet
threat. The positive common basis of our alliances —
the defense of democratic values — must be reaffirmed
and strengthened. Yet, differences among allies are like-
ly to become more evident as the traditional concern
for security that first brought them together diminishes
in intensity. We need to consider how the United States
and its allies can best respond to a new agenda of polit-
ical challenges — such as the troubled evolution of the
Soviet Union or the volatile Middle East — in the
framework of the moral and political values we contin-
ue to share.

In the realm of military strategy, we confront dangers
more ambiguous than those we previously faced. What
type and distribution of forces are needed to combat
not a particular, poised enemy but the nascent threats
of power vacuums and regional instabilities? How do
we reduce our conventional capabilities in ways that
ensure we could rebuild them faster than an enemy
could build a devastating new threat against us? How
does the proliferation of advanced weaponry affect our
traditional problem of deterrence? How should we
think about these new military challenges and what

 

capabilities and forces should we develop to secure
ourselves against them?

America will continue to support an international-eco-
nomic system as open and inclusive as possible, as the
best way to strengthen global economic development,
political stability and the growth of free societies. But
how can these goals best be attained, especially if they
are not completely shared by all of our economic com-
petitors? How will the end of the Cold War and the
increased economic strength of our major trading part-
ners influence economic, political and even security
relationships? In addition to working actively to con-
clude successfully the Uruguay Round of Multilateral
Trade Negotiations, what other market-opening objec-
tives should the United States pursue, and with whom
should we pursue them?

In the emerging post-Cold War world, international
relations promise to be more complicated, more
volatile and less predictable. Indeed, of all the mistakes
that could be made about the security challenges of a
new era, the most dangerous would be to believe that
suddenly the future can be predicted with certainty.
The history of the 20th century has been replete with
surprises, many unwelcome.

In many ways, if there is a historical analogy for today’s
strategic environment, it is less the late 1940s than it is
the 1920s. In the 1920s, judging that the great threat to
our interests had collapsed and that no comparable
threat was evident, the Nation turned inward. That
course had near disastrous consequences then and it
would be even more dangerous now. At a time when
the world is far more interdependent — economically,
technologically, environmentally — any attempt to iso-
late ourselves militarily and politically would be folly.

Despite the emergence of new power centers, the
United States remains the only state with truly global
strength, reach and influence in every dimension —
political, economic and military. In these circum-
stances, our natural desire to share burdens more equi-
tably with newly-strong friends does not relieve us of
our own responsibilities.

America’s role is rooted not only in power, but also in
trust. When, in the aftermath of the invasion of Kuwait,
the Saudis invited foreign forces onto their soil, King
Fahd observed:

2

 

| trust the United States of America. | know that
when you say you will be committed, you are, in
fact, committed. | know that you will stay as long as
necessary to do what has to be done, and | know
you will leave when you are asked to leave at the
end, and that you have no ulterior motives.

We cannot be the world’s policeman with responsibility
for solving all the world’s security problems. But we
remain the country to whom others turn when in dis-
tress. This faith in us creates burdens, certainly, and in
the Gulf we showed that American leadership must
include mobilizing the world community to share the
danger and risk. But the failure of others to bear their
burden would not excuse us. In the end, we are
answerable to our own interests and our own con-
science — to our ideals and to history — for what we
do with the power we have. In the 1990s, as for much
of this century, there is no substitute for American lead-
ership. Our responsibility, even in a new era, is pivotal
and inescapable. :

The Gulf crisis interrupted a time of hope. We saw a
new world coming, a world freer from the threat of ter-
ror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, more secure in the
quest for peace. Democracy was gaining ground as
were the principles of human rights and political and
economic freedom. This new world is still within reach,
perhaps brought closer by the unprecedented interna-
tional cooperation achieved in the Gulf crisis.

But even after such a success, we face not only the
complex security issues outlined above, but a new
agenda of new kinds of security issues. Our national
power, for example, ultimately rests on the strength and
resilience of our economy, and our security would be
badly served if we allowed fiscal irresponsibility at
home to erode our ability to protect our interests
abroad, to aid new democracies or to help find solu-
tions to other global problems. The scourge of illegal
drugs saps our vitality as a free people, diverts our ener-
gies from more positive pursuits and threatens friendly
democratic governments now plagued by drug traffick-
ers. The environmental depredations of Saddam
Hussein have underscored that protecting the global
ecology is a top priority on the agenda of international
cooperation — from extinguishing oil fires in Kuwait to
preserving the rain forests to solving water disputes to
assessing climate change. The upheavals of this era are
also giving rise to human migrations on an unprece-
dented scale, raising a host of social, economic, politi-
cal and moral challenges to the world’s nations.

 

 

A security strategy that takes the Republic safely into
the next century will tend to these as well as to more
traditional threats to our safety and well-being.

OUR INTERESTS AND
OBJECTIVES IN THE 1990s

We need, then, an approach to security broad enough
to preserve the basic sources of our national strength
and focused enough to deal with the very real threats
that still exist. Such an approach begins with an under-
standing of our basic interests and objectives, interests
and objectives that even in a new era are enduring:

The survival of the United States as a free and inde-
pendent nation, with its fundamental values intact and
its institutions and people secure.

The United States seeks, whenever possible in concert
with its allies, to:

* deter any aggression that could threaten the security
of the United States and its allies and — should
deterrence fail — repel or defeat military attack and
end conflict on terms favorable to the United States,
its interests and its allies;

¢ effectively counter threats to the security of the
United States and its citizens and interests short of
armed conflict, including the threat of international
terrorism;

¢ improve stability by pursuing equitable and verifi-
able arms control agreements, modernizing our
strategic deterrent, developing systems capable of
defending against limited ballistic-missile strikes,
and enhancing appropriate conventional capabili-
ties;

* promote democratic change in the Soviet Union,
while maintaining firm policies that discourage any
temptation to new quests for military advantage;

foster restraint in global military spending and dis-
courage military adventurism;

© prevent the transfer of militarily critical technologies
and resources to hostile countries or groups, espe-
cially the spread of chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons and associated high-technology means of
delivery; and

 

 

¢ reduce the flow of illegal drugs into the United
States by encouraging reduction in foreign produc-
tion, combatting international traffickers and reduc-
ing demand at home.

A healthy and growing U.S. economy to ensure oppor-
tunity for individual prosperity and resources for
national endeavors at home and abroad.

National security and economic strength are indivisi-
ble. We seek to:

* promote a strong, prosperous and competitive U.S.
economy;

© ensure access to foreign markets, energy, mineral
resources, the oceans and space;

© promote an open and expanding international eco-
nomic system, based on market principles, with min-
imal distortions to trade and investment, stable cur-
rencies, and broadly respected rules for managing
and resolving economic disputes; and

¢ achieve cooperative international solutions to key
environmental challenges, assuring the sustainability
and environmental security of the planet as well as
growth and opportunity for all.

Healthy, cooperative and politically vigorous relations
with allies and friendly nations.

To build and sustain such relationships, we seek to:

* strengthen and enlarge the commonwealth of free
nations that share a commitment to democracy and
individual rights;

* establish a more balanced partnership with our allies
and a greater sharing of global leadership and
responsibilities;

* strengthen international institutions like the United
Nations to make them more effective in promoting
peace, world order and political, economic and
social progress;

© support Western Europe’s historic march toward
greater economic and political unity, including a
European security identity within the Atlantic
Alliance, and nurture a closer relationship between
the United States and the European Community; and

3

 

 

¢ work with our North Atlantic allies to help develop
the processes of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe to bring about reconciliation,
security and democracy in a Europe whole and free.

A stable and secure world, where political and eco-
nomic freedom, human rights and democratic institu-
tions flourish.

Our interests are best served in a world in which
democracy and its idfeals are widespread and
secure. We seek to:

¢ maintain stable regional military-balances to deter
those powers that might seek regional dominance;

promote diplomatic solutions to regional disputes;

promote the growth of free, democratic political
institutions as the surest guarantors of both human
rights and economic and social progress;

aid in combatting threats to democratic institutions
from aggression, coercion, insurgencies, subversion,
terrorism and illicit drug trafficking; and

support aid, trade and investment policies that pro-
mote economic development and social and politi-
cal progress.

 

 

Il. Trends in The World Today: New
Opportunities and Concerns

FUNDAMENTAL
TRANSFORMATIONS

Despite the uncertainties that remain, we see a funda-
mental transformation of the global strategic environ-
ment in several areas. Our policies and strategy for the
decade ahead must be designed to adapt to these
changes, and to shape them in ways that benefit the
United States and its friends and allies.

The Soviet Future

If Central and Eastern Europe was the scene of the
peaceful Revolution of 1989, the dramatic story of
1991 is the deepening crisis within the Soviet Union.
The old system of Communist orthodoxy is discredited,
yet its diehard adherents have not given up the struggle
against change. Fundamental choices — of multi-party
democracy, national self-determination and market
economic reform — have been postponed too long.
The economy is deteriorating. The painful process of
establishing new, legitimate political and economic
institutions has much farther to go.

If reform is to succeed, Soviet leaders must move deci-
sively to effect institutional change. When invited and
where appropriate, we will offer our cooperation. But it
is clearly not in our interest to offer assistance in a way
that allows the Soviet government to avoid the hard
choices that in the longer run are the only hope for the
people of that country. At the July 1991 London
Economic Summit, the participants announced their
support for special associate status for the Soviet Union
in the IMF and World Bank. This will give the Soviets
access to the technical advice they need to formulate
and implement their reform program.

 

 

The processes of reform inside the Soviet Union have
already had a revolutionary impact on Soviet foreign
policy. With former ideological imperatives giving way
to a new pragmatism, areas of cooperation have
expanded. The end of Soviet domination of Eastern
Europe was a transforming event. Soviet policy toward
the unification of Germany was constructive. The
reduced role of ideology in Soviet foreign policy has
diminished the importance of many developing areas
as arenas of conflict with the West. Soviet support in
the UN Security Council for the resolutions against
Iraqi aggression was an important contribution to the
international effort. We are hopeful that such coopera-
tion can be expanded. Of course, the Soviets would
pay a severe political price for any return to practices of
an earlier era, exploiting regional disputes and instabili-
ties for their presumed advantage.

Today, the threat of a U.S.-Soviet military conflict is
lower than at any time since the end of World War II.
With the ongoing withdrawal of Soviet forces from
Eastern Europe, the unilateral reductions now under-
way and the recently signed CFE treaty (if faithfully
implemented), the threat of a sudden, massive offensive
against NATO will have been eliminated. Despite
uncertainty over the Soviet internal evolution, any
attempt by the Soviets to restore such a threat would
require lengthy preparation and be enormously costly
and virtually impossible to conceal. Moreover, the
START Treaty signed at the Moscow Summit will signifi-
cantly reduce US and Soviet strategic nuclear arsenals.

But Soviet military power is hardly becoming irrelevant.
The Soviet Union is and will remain a military super-
power. Beyond its modernized strategic arsenal, the
Soviet Union’s conventional forces west of the Urals
will dwarf any other national force in Europe. While
they no longer pose the threat of a short-warning, the-

 

ater-wide offensive, they could still pose a potent threat
to a single flank or region. The size and orientation of
Soviet military forces must therefore remain critical
concerns to the United States and the overall health of
the European system will still require a counterweight
to Soviet military strength.

It is our responsibility as a government to hedge against
the uncertainties of the future. Elements of the U.S.-
Soviet relationship will remain competitive, and there is
always the danger that confrontations will re-emerge.
Our evolving relationship is also not immune to Soviet
attempts to lay the problems created by decades of
domestic tyranny, misrule and mismanagement at the
feet of “foreign enemies”. Nor is it immune to the
implications of the forceful repression of democratic
forces, slowing the Soviet Union’s progress on a road
that must be taken if it is to successfully meet the chal-
lenges before it. The internal order of a state is ultimate-
ly reflected in its external behavior. We will remain
alert to the potential strategic consequences of a return
to totalitarian policies.

The Growing Roles of
Germany and Japan

One of the most important and far-reaching strategic
developments of a new era — and a major success of
America’s postwar policy — is the emergence of Japan
and Germany as economic and political leaders. The
United States has long encouraged such a develop-
ment, and our close ties with these democracies have
created the climate of reassurance necessary for their
evolution as stable and powerful countries enjoying
good relations with their neighbors. As these countries
assume a greater political role, the health of American
ties with them — political, military and economic —
will remain crucial to regional and even global stability.
These links are not relics of an earlier period. They are
all the more needed in a new era as these countries’
roles expand.

But we frequently find ourselves competitors —
sometimes even bitter competitors — in the economic
arena. These frictions must be managed if we are to
preserve the partnerships that have fostered
reconciliation, reassurance, democracy and security in
the postwar period. In this sense, ongoing trade
negotiations now share some of the strategic
importance we have traditionally attached to arms
talks with the Soviet Union.

6

 

The Gulf crisis has also reopened, with a new sense of
urgency, the question of responsibility-sharing — not
only with respect to sharing the costs and risks of Gulf
operations, but also with regard to sharing the costs of
U.S. forces defending Europe and Japan. Our allies are
doing more, as befits their economic strength, but the
issue may grow more acute as we and they adjust to a
new era.

The New Europe

It is Europe more than any other area that has held the
key to the global balance in this century, and it is this
continent more than any other that is experiencing fun-
damental change. The unification of Germany last
October quickened the pace to a new, more promising
era and a continent truly whole and free. As Europe is
being transformed politically, we are also lifting the
military shadows and fears with which we have lived
for nearly half a century.

All across the Continent, the barriers that once confined
people and ideas are collapsing. East Europeans are
determining their own destinies, choosing freedom and
economic liberty. One by one, the states of Central and
Eastern Europe have begun to reclaim the European
cultural and political tradition that is their heritage. All
Soviet forces are gone from Czechoslovakia and
Hungary and withdrawals from Germany and Poland
are underway. The military capability of the Soviet
forces still remaining in Eastern Europe is rapidly dimin-
ishing and the Warsaw Pact has been dissolved.

Basic to the new structure of peace we seek to build
throughout Europe is the continued vitality of the North
Atlantic Alliance — the indispensable foundation of
transatlantic cooperation. To keep the Alliance strong
and viable in a new environment we must recognize
that there are important tasks beyond the changed —
but still important — requirement to balance and deter
Soviet military power. NATO must deter and defend
against the threat of aggression from any state against
the territory of a NATO member. NATO will also be
essential in promoting a stable security environment
throughout Europe, an environment based on demo-
cratic institutions and the peaceful resolution of dis-
putes, an environment free of intimidation or attempts
at hegemony. Finally, NATO still serves as an indispens-
able transatlantic forum for consultations on issues that
affect common political and security interests.

 

 

As the European Community heads toward the new
milestone of a single market by the end of 1992, we
enter a revolution of relations in the West, perhaps ulti-
mately as important strategically as the revolution tak-
ing place in the East. It is no accident that Europeans
are contemplating greater West European cohesion in
the security field, even while preserving the vital
transatlantic framework. We will work to adapt NATO’s
structures to encompass European desires for a distinct
security identity within the Alliance and we will
encourage greater European responsibility for Europe’s
defense. While European governments will naturally
take the lead in developing their own institutions, these
efforts will enjoy our full support as long as they
strengthen the Alliance. We will also work to adapt
Alliance command structures to new realities — the
reassessment of risks, a new NATO strategy, a different
force structure — in ways that sustain the unique con-
tribution of NATO’s integrated military command.

The continued freedom, vitality and national indepen-
dence of the new Eastern European democracies are
also critical to the new structure of peace we seek to
build throughout Europe. Any reversal of the present
positive trend in Soviet policy would have serious
implications. As the North Atlantic allies declared in
June: “Our own security is inseparably linked to that of
all other states in Europe. The consolidation and preser-
vation throughout the continent of democratic societies
and their freedom from any form of coercion or intimi-
dation are therefore of direct and material concern to
us.” We and our NATO allies have established a pro-
gram of contacts with the militaries of these states to
support military establishments that will sustain newly
won freedoms and we have extended our bilateral
International Military Education and Training (IMET)
program to strengthen military professionalism and to
promote the principle of civilian oversight of the armed
forces.

It is important that we not let euphoria over the easing
of East-West confrontation blind us to the potential
security problems within a new Europe. Historical
enmities in Western Europe have been largely con-
signed to the past but disputes between and among
some Eastern European states and ethnic groups appear
to have been merely frozen in time by decades of Cold
War. In the interwar period, the politics of these states
were often dominated by economic hardship, compet-
ing nationalisms and overlapping territorial claims. We
have reason to be more hopeful today, but security

 

 

problems could emerge in the East in the course of the
1990s. The powerful centrifugal forces in Yugoslavia
are particularly worrisome.

The overall structure of peace in Europe must be made
solid enough to withstand the turmoil that looms
ahead. We need to develop the processes and princi-
ples of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe (CSCE) and perhaps other mechanisms to ease
ethnic and national tensions and to dampen and
resolve conflicts.

Europe also may be about to. face a new problem, not
new in kind, but in scope: mass migrations and flows of
refugees in response to the breakdown of the commu-
nist world and the magnetic attraction of Western
European prosperity. From the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe, from North Africa and the Near East,
we could see thousands fleeing economic hardship and
seeking a better life. For Western European countries,
there could be enormous economic, social and politi-
cal strains — an unprecedented challenge to the new
Europe, testing its moral and political character.

REGIONAL TRENDS

While Europe remains a central strategic arena, the
Gulf crisis reminded us how much our interests can be
affected in other regions as well.

As the effects of the Cold War recede, regional disputes
are less likely automatically to be perceived as part of a
permanent — frequently dangerous, sometimes violent
— global competition, thus allowing broader interna-
tional cooperation in their resolution.

Less happily, in some regions this overall positive trend
could unleash local, destructive forces that were for-
merly kept in check. As we saw in the Gulf, there is the
danger of locally dominant powers, armed with mod-
ern weaponry and ancient ambitions, threatening the
world’s hope for a new era of cooperation. We see
regimes that have made themselves champions of
regional radicalism, states that are all too vulnerable to
such pressures, governments that refuse to recognize
one another, and countries that have claims on one
another’s territory — some with significant military
capabilities and a history of recurring war. A key task
for the future will be maintaining regional balances and
resolving such disputes before they erupt in military
conflict.

 

If the end of the Cold War lives up to its promise and
liberates U.S. policy from many of its earlier concerns,
we should be able to concentrate more on enhancing
security — in the developing world, particularly —
through means that are more political, social and eco-
nomic than military. We must recognize the stark fact
that our hopeful new era still has within it dislocations
and dangers that threaten the fragile shoots of democra-
cy and progress that have recently emerged.
Malnutrition, illiteracy and poverty put dangerous pres-
sures on democratic institutions as hungry, uneducated
or poorly housed citizens are ripe for radicalization by
movements of the left and the right. Our response to
need and turmoil must increasingly emphasize the
strengthening of democracy, and a long-term invest-
ment in the development of human resources and the
structures of free markets and free governments. Such
measures are an investment in our own security as well
as a response to the demands of simple justice.

The Western Hemisphere

Nowhere is this more true than in our own
hemisphere, where our fundamental aims are to
deepen the sense of partnership and common interest.

Latin Americans have long argued that U.S. interest has
waxed and waned with the rise and fall of extra-
hemispheric threats to regional security. Our policy has
sought to allay these fears, as it is founded on the
principle of a common destiny and mutual
responsibility. The Western Hemisphere is all the more
significant to the United States in light of today’s global
trends, political and economic.

The resurgence of democracy, the worldwide
phenomenon that is such an inspiration to us, is
heading toward a dramatic achievement — a
completely democratic hemisphere. This drive gained
momentum last year with the election of democratic
governments in Nicaragua and Haiti, the restoration of
democracy in Panama, and several other democratic
elections. The electoral defeat of the Sandinista
government in Nicaragua is especially noteworthy as it
has led to the end of Soviet and Cuban military
assistance, thereby increasing the security of all of
Central America. The United States has provided
political and economic support for the new
government and its program for reconstruction and
long-term development. Despite these successes, we
realize that democratic institutions in much of Latin

8

 

America remain fragile, and we are seeking ways to
strengthen them.

In our military-to-military relations, we will continue to
promote professionalism, support for civilian authority
and respect for human rights. With recent legislative
changes, we can more easily include civilian officials
in our IMET program. Effective civilian control of the
military will become a reality only when there is a
cadre of competent civilian resource managers with
the expertise to take the lead in defense issues.

Cuba remains a holdout in the hemisphere’s transition
to democracy but it is simply a matter of time before
fundamental change occurs there, too. We will
continue to press the Soviet Union to reduce its aid
and presence in Cuba and we will enlist our friends in
the hemisphere in pressing Cuba to accept the
inevitable peacefully. In Central America, we support
the regional trend toward negotiation, demilitarization
and demobilization. The nations most severely
threatened by guerrilla forces or narco-terrorists — El
Salvador, Colombia and Peru — will receive
appropriate support from the United States.

As many countries make the transition to democracy, a
strong tide of economic realism and dedication to mar-
ket-oriented reforms is also sweeping the region. Our
interest in supporting both democratic and economic
transitions in Latin America and the Caribbean is
demonstrated by the new Enterprise for the Americas
Initiative. This Initiative, which has been warmly wel-
comed in the region, sets out a vision of hemispheric
prosperity achieved through expanded trade, increased
investment, reduced debt burdens and important sup-
port for protection of the hemisphere’s vital natural her-
itage. Concrete steps have been taken toward a hemi-
spheric free trade area, including work on trade and
investment framework agreements and a Free Trade
Agreement embracing both Mexico and Canada. We
are also encouraging countries to take steps to compete
for capital and are working to reduce bilateral official
debt of countries committed to strong economic
reforms. We are seeking prompt Congressional
approval of enabling legislation. In addition, we have
proposed a specific trade preference system (patterned
after the successful Caribbean Basin Initiative) to help
Andean countries break out of their dependence on
illegal drug crops. We will also work with our friends to
develop the initiatives that make up the Partnership for
Democracy and Development in Central America.

 

 

East Asia and the Pacific

East Asia and the Pacific are home to some of the
world’s most economically and politically dynamic
societies. The region also includes some of the last tra-
ditional Communist regimes on the face of the globe.
Regional hotspots tragically persist on the Korean
peninsula and in Cambodia, and there are territorial
disputes in which progress is long overdue, including
the Soviet Union's continued occupation of Japan’s
Northern Territories.

In this complex environment, an era of Soviet adven-
turism is on the ebb, even while its effects linger. This
is placing new stresses on Vietnam, Cambodia and
North Korea as Soviet military and economic aid
declines and Moscow seeks to improve relations with
Seoul, Tokyo and other capitals. China is coming to
view its neighbors in a new light, and is gradually
adjusting to a changing perception of the Soviet threat.

Through a web of bilateral relationships, the United
States has pursued throughout the postwar period a
policy of engagement in support of the stability and
security that are prerequisites to economic and politi-
cal progress. U.S. power remains welcome in key
states in the region, who recognize the pivotal role we
continue to play in the regional balance. We remain a
key factor of reassurance and stability. By ensuring
freedom of the seas through naval and air strength and
by offering these capabilities as a counterweight in the
region’s power equations, we are likely to remain wel-
come in an era of shifting patterns and possible as new
frictions.

Today’s basically healthy conditions cannot be taken
for granted. We will continue to be a beacon for
democracy and human rights. We will meet our
responsibilities in the security field. We will also
remain actively engaged in promoting free and
expanding markets through Asian Pacific Economic

_ Cooperation, recognizing that economic progress is a
major ingredient in Asia’s political stability and demo-
cratic progress.

As noted earlier, our alliance with Japan remains of
enormous strategic importance. Our hope is to see the
U.S.-Japan global partnership extend beyond its
traditional confines and into fields like refugee relief,
non-proliferation and the environment.

 

 

On the Korean peninsula, we and the Republic of
Korea seek to persuade North Korea of the benefit of
confidence-building measures as a first step to lasting
peace and reunification. We firmly believe that true
stability can only be achieved through direct North-
South talks. At the same time, the United States
remains committed to the security of the Republic of
Korea as it continues to open its economic and
political systems. We are increasingly concerned about
North Korea’s failure to observe its obligations under
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and consider this
to be the most pressing security issue on the peninsula.

China, like the Soviet Union, poses a complex
challenge as it proceeds inexorably toward major
systemic change. China’s inward focus and struggle to
achieve stability will not preclude increasing
interaction with its neighbors as trade and technology
advance. Consultations and contact with China will be
central features of our policy, lest we intensify the
isolation that shields repression. Change is inevitable
in China, and our links with China must endure.

The United States maintains strong, unofficial,
substantive relations with Taiwan where rapid
economic and political change is underway. One of
our goals is to foster an environment in which Taiwan
and the Peoples Republic of China can pursue a
constructive and peaceful interchange across the
Taiwan Strait.

In Southeast Asia, there is renewed hope for a
settlement in Cambodia. Only through resolution of
the conflict in Cambodia can there be the promise of
our restoring normal relations with that beleaguered
nation and with Vietnam. Hanoi and Phnom Penh
have sadly delayed the day when they can enjoy
normal ties with us or their Southeast Asian neighbors.
Of course, the pace and scope of our actions will also
be directly affected by steps that are taken to resolve
the fate of Americans still unaccounted for. The
resolution of this issue remains one of our highest
priorities.

Even with the loss of Clark Air Base, we remain com-
mitted to helping the Philippines make a success of its
new democracy and to fulfilling our legitimate defense
function there as allies and equals. In the South Pacific,
we are demonstrating renewed interest in and assis-
tance for the island states. Australia retains its special
position as a steadfast ally and key Pacific partner. We

9

 

 

look forward to the day when New Zealand will
choose to resume its responsibilities to the ANZUS
alliance and rejoin Australia and the United States in
this important regional structure.

The Middle East and South
Asia

The reversal of Iraq's aggression against Kuwait was a
watershed event. Nonetheless, our basic policy toward
the region shows powerful continuity. American
strategic concerns still include promoting stability and
the security of our friends, maintaining a free flow of
oil, curbing the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and ballistic missiles, discouraging
destabilizing conventional! arms sales, countering
terrorism and encouraging a peace process that brings
about reconciliation between Israel and the Arab states
as well as between Palestinians and Israel in a manner
consonant with our enduring commitment to Israel’s
security.

The regional environment since Desert Storm presents
new challenges and new opportunities. Even as we
provide badly needed relief and protection to refugees,
we will work to bring about greater security and a
lasting peace.

* We will help states in the Middle East to fashion
regional security arrangements that bolster deter-
rence and encourage the peaceful resolution of dis-
putes.

© We will work with parties inside and outside the
region to change the destructive pattern of military
competition and proliferation. This will involve con-
fidence-building and arms contro! measures as well
as more global forms of control over the supply of
arms, especially weapons of mass destruction and
the means to deliver them.

¢ We will encourage economic reconstruction and
recovery, using the political and economic strengths
of the victorious coalition to support economic
openness and cooperation. We will also encourage
regional states to evolve toward greater political par-
ticipation and respect for human rights.

© We will continue the effort to bring about a compre-
hensive peace and true reconciliation between Israel

10

 

and the Arab states and between Israel and the
Palestinians.

¢ We will continue to demand that Iraq comply fully
and unconditionally with all relevant UN resolu-
tions, including Security Council Resolution 687 and
its stipulation that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction
and ballistic missile-related facilities be destroyed.

© We remain open to an improved relationship with
Iran. However, meaningful improvement can only
occur after Iran makes clear it is lending no support
to hostage-taking or other forms of terrorism.

* Wewill also continue to monitor Libyan behavior,
including terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and attempts to destabilize neighboring
governments.

In South Asia, as elsewhere, we strongly believe that
security is best served by resolving disputes through
negotiations rather than military pressure. The dangers
of intermediate-range missile deployments and nuclear
proliferation in the sub-continent persist, however, and
this year we were unable to certify Pakistan’s nuclear
program under the Pressler Amendment. We will con-
tinue to encourage Indo-Pakistani rapprochement and
the adoption of confidence-building measures and
other concrete steps to moderate their military competi-
tion. We also remain committed to achieving a com-
prehensive political settlement in Afghanistan.

Africa

The end of the Cold war should benefit Africa in that it
will no longer be seen as a battleground for superpower
conflict. In a world at peace, more attention and
resources should be freed to help the world’s poorest.
Nonetheless, many Africans now fear that the outside
world will lose interest in their troubled continent, just
at the moment when many negative trends from eco-
nomic decline to AIDS to environmental degradation
are likely to accelerate.

In a continent as diverse as Africa, democracy — as it
emerges, reemerges, or begins its development — may
take different forms, and its progress will be uneven.
But we need not be inhibited in supporting values that
have proved universal — political and human rights,
democratic limits on the powers of government, judi-
cial independence, free press and free speech. To those
who think these goals are out of reach because of

 

 

 

Africa’s poverty and disparate cultures, we say that
democracy remains the political system most open to
cultura! diversity and most conducive to economic
advance. Freedom, in its universal meaning, is Africa’s
birthright as much as it is anyone else’s.

In the economic realm, hope lies in reducing the bur-
den of statism and encouraging indigenous enterprise
and human talent, especially in agriculture. The most
important steps are those that must be taken by
Africans themselves. Concepts of democracy and mar-
ket economics must be applied in a continent where
initially these concepts were rejected because social-
ism was fashionable. That failed experiment has now
run its course, and political elites across Africa are
rediscovering basic truths about political and econom-
ic freedom as the source of progress. We need to sup-
port this growing realism, which recognizes the failures
from the past and which has produced pragmatic new
leaders ready to move in new directions. Benign
neglect will not suffice.

 

 

Africa is not without its beacons of hope. The efforts of
white and black leaders in South Africa to move that
country into a democratic, constitutional, post-
apartheid era merit our active support and we have
provided it. We have made clear our firm and enthusi-
astic support for the brave endeavor on which they
have embarked.

Elsewhere in Africa, we can be proud of the role we
played in bringing to an end civil wars in Angola and
Ethiopia. We continue to play an active role in helping
to resolve other conflicts such as those in Liberia and
Mozambique.

Africa is now entering an age in which it can benefit
from past mistakes and build a realistic, self-sustaining
future. It is in our interest, for political as well as
humanitarian reasons, to help that process.

Il. Relating Means to Ends: A Political
Agenda for the 1990s

ALLIANCES, COALITIONS
AND A NEW UNITED
NATIONS

Our first priority in foreign policy remains solidarity
with our allies and friends. The stable foundation of
our security will continue to be a common effort with
peoples with whom we share fundamental moral and
political values and security interests. Those nations
with whom we are bound by alliances will continue to
be our closest partners in building a new world order.

As our response to the Gulf crisis demonstrated, our
leadership in a new era must also include a broader
concept of international community and international
diplomacy. If tensions with the Soviet Union continue
to ease, we will face more ambiguous — but still seri-
ous — challenges. It will be difficult to foresee where
future crises will arise. In many cases they will involve
states not part of one or another bloc. Increasingly we
may find ourselves in situations in which our interests
are congruent with those of nations not tied to us by
formal treaties. As in the Gulf, we may be acting in
hybrid coalitions that include not only traditional allies
but also nations with whom we do not have a mature
history of diplomatic and military cooperation or,
indeed, even a common political or moral outlook.
This will require flexibility in our diplomacy and mili-
tary policy, without losing sight of the fundamental val-
ues which that diplomacy and policy are designed to
protect and on which they are based. To this end, we
are well served to strengthen the role of international
organizations like the United Nations.

 

 

For over 40 years political differences, bloc politics
and demagogic rhetoric have kept the UN from reach-
ing the full potential envisioned by its founders. Now
we see the UN beginning to act as it was designed,
freed from the superpower antagonisms that often frus-
trated consensus, less hobbled by the ritualistic anti-
Americanism that so often weakened its credibility.

The response of the UN to Iraq’s unprovoked aggres-
sion against a member state has truly vindicated and
rejuvenated the institution. But even before that, the
UN had distinguished itself in fostering democratic
change in Namibia and Nicaragua. In the near future,
we hope to see it play a constructive role in
Afghanistan, Cambodia, the Western Sahara, El
Salvador and elsewhere, assisting with elections and
the return of displaced persons, as well as with peace-
keeping.

The role of the UN in improving the human condition
and ameliorating human suffering — development, aid
to refugees, education, disaster relief — will continue
to attract our leadership and resources. High on our
agenda for international cooperation are the global
challenges posed by illegal drugs, terrorism and degra-
dation of the environment.

The costs of a world organization that can effectively
carry out these missions are already significant and will
increase as new tasks are undertaken. We have re-stat-
ed our intention to pay in full our annual assessments
and are now paying arrearages. We intend to complete
arrearage payments no later than 1995 and to pay our
share of any new peacekeeping requirements. In vol-
untary funding, we will pay our fair share and encour-
age others to do the same.

THE CONTEST OF IDEAS
AND THE NURTURING OF
DEMOCRACY

Recent history has shown how much ideas count. The
Cold War was, in its decisive aspect, a war of ideas. But
ideas count only when knowledge spreads. In today’s
evolving political environment, and in the face of the
global explosion of information, we must make clear to
our friends and potential adversaries what we stand for.

The need for international understanding among differ-
ent peoples, cultures, religions and forms of govern-
ment will only grow. In a world without the clear-cut
East-West divisions of the past, the flow of ideas and
information will take on larger significance as once-iso-
lated countries seek their way toward the international
mainstream. Indeed, information access has already
achieved global proportions. A truly global community
is being formed, vindicating our democratic values.

Through broadcasts, academic and cultural exchanges,
press briefings, publications, speakers and conferences,
we engage those abroad in a dialogue about who and
what we are — to inform foreign audiences about our
policies, democratic traditions, pluralistic society and
rich academic and cultural diversity. We will increase
our efforts to clarify what America has to contribute to
the solution of global problems — and to drive home
democracy’s place in this process.

ARMS CONTROL

Arms control is an important component of a balanced
strategy to ameliorate the deadly consequences of glob-
al tensions as well as to reduce their fundamental caus-
es. Our goal remains agreements that will enhance the
security of the United States and its allies while
strengthening international stability by:

¢ reducing military capabilities that could provide
incentives to initiate attack;

¢ enhancing predictability in the size and structure of
forces in order to reduce the fear of aggressive intent;

e ensuring confidence in compliance, through effec-
tive verification.

14

 

 

Our pursuit of these goals has profited from the recent,
positive changes in East-West relations. With renewed

commitment to conscientious implementation and the
resolution of remaining issues, we are within reach of

completing an arms contro! agenda that few imagined

possible.

Much has already been accomplished. Within the past
year we and the Soviets have agreed to cease produc-
tion of chemical weapons and to destroy, using safe
and environmentally-sound procedures, the vast major-
ity of our chemical weapons stocks. We have agreed to
new protocols to treaties on limiting underground
nuclear weapons tests and nuclear explosions for
peaceful purposes, incorporating unprecedented on-site
verification of compliance with the limits set by the
treaties. At the Paris Summit last November, the United
States, the Soviet Union and the other nations of the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
(CSCE) endorsed new measures to promote transparen-
cy in military dispositions and practices.

Also in Paris, the United States, our North Atlantic
allies, the states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union
signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe (CFE), a historic agreement that will establish
numerical parity in major conventional armaments
between East and West from the Atlantic to the Urals.
The treaty will require thousands of weapons to be
destroyed and includes unprecedented monitoring pro-
visions. Submitting the treaty to the Senate for its advice
and consent to ratification was delayed by Soviet
claims — made after the treaty was signed — that some
of its ground force equipment held by units like naval
infantry and coastal defense was not covered by the
agreement. The satisfactory resolution of this question
has opened the way for us to move forward.

Soviet behavior on CFE complicated the completion of
a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. However, during the
London Economic Summit, Presidents Bush and
Gorbachev were able to overcome the last few obsta-
cles on START, ending nine long years of difficult, tech-
nical negotiations. Signed in Moscow, this agreement
will mark a fundamental milestone in reducing the risk
of nuclear war — stabilizing the balance of strategic
forces at lower levels, providing for significant reduc-
tions in the most threatening weapons and encouraging
a shift toward strategic systems better suited for retalia-
tion than for a first strike.

 

Our efforts to improve strategic stability will not stop
here. We and the Soviets have pledged further efforts to
enhance strategic stability and reduce the risk of nucle-
ar war. We will seek agreements that improve surviv-
ability, remove incentives for a nuclear first strike and
implement an appropriate relationship between strate-
gic offenses and defenses. In particular, we will pursue
Soviet agreement to permit the deployment of defenses
designed to address the threat of limited ballistic missile
strikes, a growing mutual concern. We are also consult-
ing with our NATO allies on the framework that will
guide the United States in future discussions with the
Soviet Union on the reduction of short-range nuclear
forces in Europe.

The United States has long supported international
agreements designed to promote openness and freedom
of navigation on the high seas. Over the past year, how-
ever, the Soviet Union has intensified efforts to restrict
naval forces in ways contrary to internationally recog-
nized rights of access. We will continue to reject such
proposals. As a maritime nation, with our dependence
on the sea to preserve legitimate security and commer-
cial ties, freedom of the seas is and will remain a vital
interest. We will not agree to measures that would limit
the ability of our Navy to protect that interest, nor will
we permit a false equation to be drawn between our
Navy and regional ground-force imbalances that are
inherently destabilizing. Recent events in the Gulf,
Liberia, Somalia and elsewhere show that American
seapower, without arbitrary limits on its force structure
or operations, makes a strong contribution to global sta-
bility and mutual security.

STEMMING PROLIFERATION

As we put the main elements of European and East-
West arms control into place, attention will increasingly
turn to other regional and global arms contro! objec-
tives. None is more urgent than stopping the global
proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons, as well as the missiles to deliver them.

The Gulf crisis drove home several lessons about this
challenge:

¢ International agreements, while essential, cannot
cope with the problem alone. Iraq is a party to both
the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the 1968 Nuclear

 

 

 

Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Notwithstanding its
treaty obligations, Iraq has used chemical weapons
and pursued nuclear ambitions.

© Export controls must be strengthened. Chemical
weapons facilities in Libya and Iraq received tech-
nology and equipment from Western companies.
Iraq used the deadly product of its facilities against
its own people. Iraqi and several other nations’
nuclear efforts and missile programs have also bene-
fited from outside assistance.

* A successful non-proliferation strategy must address
the underlyling security concerns that drive the quest
to obtain advanced weapons and must encompass
contingency planning to deal with these weapons
should prevention fail.

We are pursuing a three-tiered non-proliferation strate-
gy: to strengthen existing arrangements; to expand the
membership of multilateral regimes directed against
proliferation; and to pursue new initiatives — such as
the Chemical Weapons Convention and the initiative
the President launched in May for the Middle East.

This latter effort reflects all the elements of our non-pro-
liferation strategy. It includes promising new approach-
es, such as a proposed set of guidelines for responsible
conventional weapons transfers to the region and a pro-
posal to freeze acquisition, production arid testing of
surface-to-surface missiles. It also seeks to expand the
membership of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the
Biological Weapons Convention, and to strengthen the
application of these and other agreements where they
are already in force. :

In other areas, we have already tightened export con-
trols, streamlining export-licensing procedures while
taking full account of security needs. New standards
will ensure that the export of supercomputers will be
subject to stringent safeguards against misuse. Criminal
penalties and other sanctions against those who con-
tribute to proliferation will be expanded.

To thwart the export of chemical and biological
weapon-related materials and technology, we have
expanded our own controls over precursor chemicals
and proposed stringent international controls, recogniz-
ing that only multilateral measures will be truly effec-
tive in a competitive global marketplace. This multilat-
eral approach bore fruit in the twenty-nation Australia

15

 

Group of major chemical suppliers, which agreed in
May to control common lists of chemical weapon pre-
cursors and equipment usable in chemical weapons
manufacture. The best non-proliferation measure, of
course, would be a completed Chemical Weapons
Convention.

Our efforts to stem the proliferation of threatening mis-
siles center on the multinational Missile Technology
Control Regime (MTCR), strengthened last year by the
inclusion of several new members. Since missile prolif-
eration efforts will surely persist, we and our MTCR
partners must improve controls, broaden membership
further and reinforce the emerging international con-
sensus against the spread of missile technology.

In the nuclear sphere, last year’s review conference of
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty produced a large
measure of consensus that the NPT remains essential to
global stability, although intransigence by a few delega-
tions blocked unanimous agreement to a final confer-
ence declaration. The United States remains steadfast in
support of the NPT and the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA), which provides technical assistance for
civilian uses of nuclear energy while safeguarding
materials essential for the development of nuclear
weapons. Although trouble spots remain, progress has
been made. Iraqi nuclear efforts have been set back
substantially, while the UN Special Commission imple-
menting Security Council Resolution 687 seeks disman-
tlement of all nuclear weapon-related activities in Iraq.
Argentina and Brazil have agreed to accept IAEA safe-
guards on all their nuclear facilities and to take steps
toward bringing into force the Treaty of Tlatelolco,
which creates a Latin American nuclear-weapons-free
zone. Agreement by India and Pakistan to ban attacks
on each other’s nuclear facilities also helped ease the
tense nuclear rivalry in that part of the world.

The proliferation of advanced weapons poses an omi-
nous challenge to global peace and stability. To meet it,
we will work with our allies to address the causes of
strife while curbing exports to builders of weapons of
mass destruction.

INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMS

The unprecedented scope and pace of change in
today’s world — and the increasing number of actors
now able to threaten global peace — highlight the need
for reliable information and a sophisticated understand-

16

 

ing of events and trends. The global reach of American
intelligence capabilities is a unique national asset, cru-
cial not only to our own security, but also to our leader-
ship role in responding to international challenges.

The Soviet Union necessarily remains a major concern
of U.S. policy. While changes in the Soviet Union
promise hope, the turbulence of change itself demands
that we monitor events and assess prospects for the
future. Our monitoring of Soviet military capabilities
and the effective verification of arms control treaties
will remain the bedrock of any effort to build confi-
dence and a safer world.

In a new era there are also new tasks and new priori-
ties. Regional turmoil will place growing burdens on
intelligence collection, processing and analysis. At the
same time, we must track the threats posed by narcotics
trafficking, terrorism and the proliferation of advanced
weapons. We must also be more fully aware of interna-
tional financial, trade and technology trends that could
affect the security of the United States, including its
economic well-being.

Sweeping political and economic changes also make
for a more challenging counterintelligence environ-
ment. Warmer relations between the United States and
former adversaries will open new opportunities for the
intelligence services of those countries. Growing inter-
national economic competition and potential regional
instabilities vastly broaden the scope of the potential
intelligence threat. Our traditional openness, combined
with recent changes in immigration laws and the sheer
volume of information flow in the United States, affords
great access to sensitive information and facilities as
well as to individuals who may be targets for intelli-
gence collection.

ECONOMIC AND SECURITY
ASSISTANCE

Foreign assistance is a vital instrument of American for-
eign policy. Now — as we look forward to expanded
cooperation with our prosperous fellow democracies,
with a growing number of regional organizations and
with a revitalized United Nations — we are revisiting
the direction and priorities of our foreign assistance
program. We will focus our efforts and resources on
five major challenges:

 

 

* Promoting and consolidating democratic values: Our
programs will be an increasingly valuable instrument
for fostering political choice, human rights and self-
determination. From Central America to South Africa
to Eastern Europe, we have used our influence to
advance these universal goals.

* Promoting market principles: U.S. assistance must
encourage economic reform and sustainable devel-
opment. Multilaterally — through institutions like
the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank,
and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade —
we foster policies that break down statist barriers to
enterprise and unleash the productive forces within
every society.

© Promoting peace: The bonds of collective defense
can be strengthened through economic and security
assistance. Such programs allow friendly states to
achieve the security and stability essential for politi-
cal freedom and economic growth. They are also an
indispensable too! in cementing our alliance rela-
tionships — enhancing interoperability, promoting
needed access and reaping goodwill.

¢ Protecting against transnational threats: International
terrorism, narcotics, AIDS and environmental degra-
dation threaten all peaceful nations. Our aid helps
combat these dangers.

¢ Meeting urgent human needs. We will respond
quickly and substantially to the suffering caused by
natural or man-made disasters.

Managed wisely, our aid programs can play a key role
in fostering a world order that comports with our funda-
mental values. But we must ensure that our resources
are adequate, that our programs pursue well-defined
goals, and that we retain the flexibility to respond to
change and unforeseen requirements and opportunities.
The changes we have recently proposed to the Foreign
Assistance Act will eliminate obsolete and inconsistent
provisions and set a solid foundation for cooperation
with the Congress on a program that can respond to
fast-moving events in the world as quickly as they
occur. Such reform is urgently needed if our aid pro-
gram is to be relevant to today’s necessities.

 

 

 

ILLICIT DRUGS

The international trade in drugs is a major threat to our
national security. No threat does more damage to our
national values and institutions, and the domestic vio-
lence generated by the trade in drugs is all too familiar.
Trafficking organizations undermine the sovereign gov-
ernments of our friends and weaken and distort nation-
al economies with a vast, debilitating black market and
large funding requirements for enforcement, criminal
justice, prevention and treatment systems. Demand
reduction at home and an aggressive attack on the
international drug trade are the main elements in our
strategy. They must be pursued together.

During the 1990s, cocaine traffickers will likely try to
develop new markets in Europe — particularly in light
of the impending relaxation of border controls between
EC countries — and in those nations of East Asia expe-
riencing rapid economic growth. We can also expect
increasingly energetic efforts to import cocaine and
heroin into the United States, including the use of
longer-range aircraft entering U.S. airspace via Canada
and of drug-laden cargo containers transhipped to the
United States via Europe and the Pacific. Renewed
assaults on the U.S. market by increasingly sophisticat-
ed traffickers remind us of the need to also attack the
drug trade at the source — its home country base of
operations.

Such an effort begins with bolstering the political com-
mitment of drug producer and transit countries to
strengthen their laws, legal institutions and programs to
prosecute, punish, and — where appropriate — extra-
dite drug traffickers and money launderers. In the
Andean region, where most of the world’s cocaine is
cultivated and refined, we seek to enhance the effec-
tiveness of host-nation law enforcement and military
activities against powerful and well entrenched traffick-
ing organizations, and to increase public and leader-
ship awareness of the drug threat. Our trade, aid and
investment programs aim to strengthen and diversify
the legitimate economies of the drug- producing
Andean nations to enable them to overcome the desta-
bilizing effects of eliminating coca and its derivatives,
major sources of income. Our heroin strategy will foster
cooperation with other countries, to engage their
resources to dismantle their own cultivation and refin-
ing industries, and reduce demand for drugs. We will
solicit the assistance of others in influencing producers
to whom we have limited access.

IMMIGRANTS AND
REFUGEES

As a nation founded by immigrants.and refugees, the
United States has a strong tradition of taking in those
who flee persecution and seek a better life. We open
our doors annually to tens of thousands of refugees and
hundreds of thousands of immigrants, welcoming both
for the diversity and strength they bring the Nation. We
also have a commitment to help the uprooted who are
in danger or in need, a commitment demonstrated in
the past several months by our role in the international
effort to assist Iraqi refugees and our reaching out to
Africans and others.

In 1990 the United States welcomed refugees from all
regions of the world. As in the past several years, the
majority came from the Soviet Union and Asia. In
Vietnam, we are dismayed by continued human rights
abuses. Hanoi is, however, allowing former political
prisoners to emigrate. The United States resettled
14,000 former political prisoners and their family mem-
bers from Vietnam in 1990 and the number will
increase this year. But we cannot take in everyone. We
must look to other countries to be more receptive to
those in need. Nor can the United States Government

18

 

fund and provide for every refugee in this country. As in
the past, our private sector has an important role to

play.

As noted earlier, economic hardship, political uncer-
tainty and ethnic strife may generate large numbers of
refugees in Europe. Some will be true refugees and oth-
ers will be economic migrants, those who move to
escape economic misery. Though international respons-
es must differ between these two categories — to be
able to protect those who flee persecution and may be
in physical danger — the world’s nations must be ready
to respond quickly and humanely to both.

For 16 million refugees worldwide, the United States
offers assistance through international programs and
recognizes the critical role of nongovernmental organi-
zations in providing care. Our budgeted refugee assis-
tance levels have increased, and we will do our fair
share. We will also meet our responsibility to search for
diplomatic solutions to the problems that spawn
refugee flows.

A period of turmoil and transition is often a period of
dislocation. If our diplomatic efforts and our aid pro-
grams prove inadequate, the volume of refugees and
migrants will be an index of our failure. The world
community will need to be prepared.

 

 

IV. Relating Means to Ends: An
Economic Agenda for the 1990s

Events of the past year have reaffirmed the critical link
between the strength and flexibility of the U.S. econo-
my and our ability to achieve national objectives.
Indeed, strong macroeconomic performance on the
part of the United States is not only an economic objec-
tive but a prerequisite for maintaining a position of
global political leadership.

ECONOMIC CHALLENGES

Even as we now see a transformation of the global
economy along lines consistent with policies we have
pursued for many years, new challenges — the crisis in
the Gulf and its aftermath, the political and economic
transformation in Eastern Europe and potentially in the
Soviet Union, the resurgence of democracy and market
economies in Central and South America — have
placed new demands on our management of economic
policy. We must ensure that our domestic economy and
our economic involvement abroad are responsive to a
changing economic landscape.

Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and actions taken by the
international coalition to resist Iraqi aggression, espe-
cially tested our economic strength and our ability to
help manage international economic forces. Economies
around the world were affected by the volatility of oil
prices and the disruption of economic ties to countries
in the Gulf. Egypt, Turkey and Jordan were particularly
hurt. We must continue to work to ensure the econom-
ic health of these countries as well as others that have
suffered markedly from this crisis. The United States
will provide leadership, but in close collaboration with
major donors and creditors and with international
financial institutions, particularly the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

 

 

As always, a dynamic domestic economy plays a criti-
cal role in helping us achieve national objectives in all
spheres. Policies to control inflation, reduce the Federal
deficit, promote savings, improve the labor force and
encourage competitiveness and entrepreneurial initia-
tive remain critical to our overall well-being and securi-
ty. As economies expand worldwide, the economic
strength of others will, of course, grow in relative terms.
This is not a threat to us, but rather a success of
Western policies. That said, Americans must realize
that the economic strength vital to our national interests
comes from investing for the future, thus putting a pre-
mium on domestic saving. Today’s labor force and
management, and those of tomorrow, must also be
committed to quality and innovation. These are the
fruits of hard work — and a prerequisite for continued
global leadership.

We continue to pursue a strategy that expands and
strengthens market economies around the world. This
will require international efforts to open markets and
expand trade; to strengthen cooperation among major
industrial countries and with international financial
institutions; and to apply imaginative solutions to the
problems of developing countries.

MAINTAINING ECONOMIC
GROWTH

Clear signs are emerging that the U.S.economy is
pulling out of its brief recession but uncertainty remains
over economic performance in much of the rest of the
world. Therefore, macroeconomic policies in all the
major countries must be designed to sustain global eco-
nomic recovery with price stability. Global growth is
needed in order to create a favorable economic and
trade environment for reform and reconstruction in

19

 

Eastern Europe and the USSR, and ensure as well the
success of the democratic, market-oriented measures
that have been adopted worldwide. The major coun-
tries must continue to strengthen global coordination of
economic policies to achieve these aims.

GLOBAL IMBALANCES

While the U.S. trade deficit has continued to decline,
trade imbalances with Japan and many other countries
remain substantial. Reducing these imbalances remains
a priority. For the United States this requires a sustained
effort to reduce and ultimately eliminate budget deficits
while also encouraging private savings and investment
in order to preserve U.S. competitiveness. Countries
with large trade surpluses bear a special responsibility
for maintaining adequate growth in domestic demand
and opening their markets further to imports.

DEBT

The aggregate debt of developing countries was pro-
jected to reach $1.3 trillion in 1990, according to the
World Bank. Inappropriate domestic policies in debtor
countries —- overvalued exchange rates, large budget
deficits, investment in inefficient public enterprises and
restrictions on trade and investment — were major
causes of this debt accumulation and contributed to
capital flight. External shocks, high international inter-
est rates and recession in the 1980s also hurt. Recently
this burden has been exacerbated by the economic dis-
locations and fluctuations in energy prices resulting
from the Gulf crisis.

In March 1989, the United States proposed a new inter-
national debt strategy that advanced voluntary reduc-
tion of commercial bank debt and debt service to help
restore debtor financial health and pave the way for
new commercial bank lending. Implementation of a
strong economic reform program supported by the IMF
and World Bank is a prerequisite. So far, Mexico, Costa
Rica, Nigeria, the Philippines, Venezuela, Morocco,
Uruguay and Chile have negotiated agreements under
these proposals. Others are undertaking reforms to
obtain such support.

Creditor governments have also made substantial con-
tributions to relief through rescheduling of official bilat-
eral debt and have recently offered new treatment for
the official debt of lower middle income countries, as

20

 

mandated by last year’s Houston Economic Summit,
and for Poland and Egypt. The Enterprise for the
Americas Initiative also promotes growth in Latin
America by emphasizing official debt reduction and
investment reform.

TRADE

Countries accept as natural that trade and investment
should flow freely within national boundaries or within
special regional groupings in order to improve econom-
ic and social welfare. Internationally, this concept has
met varying degrees of acceptance. Countries have pro-
tected certain sectors for national security, economic,
industrial or social reasons.

For the last 50 years, significant efforts have been
undertaken, primarily through the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), to expand trade among all
nations by opening markets and resolving trade dis-
putes. The latest and most ambitious effort has been the
Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations,
begun in 1986. The Uruguay Round is distinguished
from previous efforts by the intention of GATT members
to extend GATT rules to areas such as agriculture, ser-
vices, investment, the protection of intellectual property
and textiles. At the Houston Economic Summit in 1990,
the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany,
Italy, the United Kingdom, and the European
Community committed to removing trade barriers in
these politically difficult areas. The wise action of
Congress in extending “fast track” procedures for trade
agreements is evidence of America’s commitment to
responsible leadership.

The promise of the Uruguay Round has yet to be ful-
filled, however, primarily because of strong differences
over the scope and pace of efforts to dismantle the
enormous barriers to trade in agricultural goods. Given
the interdependence of modern economies, and the
need to expand trading opportunities for emerging
democracies and other developing countries, it is
important that the Round be brought to a successful
conclusion. This is a test of the ability and willingness
of all countries to rise to the challenges of a new world
order and will require compromise on all sides. The
United States will do its part. A successful Round will
not end bilateral trade disputes but it will enable coun-
tries to resolve them in a multilateral context and on
the basis of internationally agreed rules.

 

The United States will continue its efforts to expand
trade further. We are working with Japan under the
Structural Impediments Initiative to lower trade barriers.
As noted earlier, we are building on the successful
U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement by undertaking dis-
cussions with Mexico and Canada which we expect
will lead to a trilateral free trade agreement linking all
three economies. The Enterprise for the Americas
Initiative and preferential trade programs for the
Caribbean basin and the Andean region will also foster
trade liberalization.

TECHNOLOGY

The interrelationship of economic and military strength
has never been stronger. Both are affected by the way
technology transfer is handled, particularly with respect
to export controls. Balances must be struck. Loss of
technological leadership can undermine military readi-
ness and strength. Not participating freely in worldwide
markets constrains economic growth. Recent changes
to our strategic trade policies reflect a new balance
between these competing factors.

In cooperation with our Western partners in the
Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export
Controls (COCOM), we have completely overhauled
export controls, reducing them to a core list of only the
most strategically significant goods and technologies.
This action reflects the emergence of democratic gov-
ernments in Eastern Europe as well as a reduced mili-
tary threat to the United States and our allies from a dis-
solved Warsaw Pact and a Soviet army that is with-
drawing. The result has been a two-thirds reduction in
the licenses that industry is required to obtain prior to
exporting.

Treating the new democracies of Central and Eastern
Europe differently from the Soviet Union, we and our
COCOM partners have adopted a wide-ranging special
procedure for Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia
that ensures that controlled technology imports are
used for purely civilian applications. We look forward
to the day when we can remove these countries com-
pletely from the list of proscribed destinations. We have
a strong interest in promoting the growth of free mar-
kets in democratic societies. At the same time we must
be sure that the easing of COCOM controls does not
result in the proliferation of dangerous technologies to
other areas like the Middle East. For that reason, we

 

 

have — in close cooperation with other supplier
nations — significantly improved controls on technolo-
gies useful in developing nuclear, chemical and biolog-
ical weapons and the missiles to deliver them.

ENERGY

Secure, ample, diversified and clean supplies of energy
are essential to our national economic prosperity and
security. For the foreseeable future, oil will remain a
vital element in our energy mix. For geological and
economic reasons, U.S. oil imports are likely to
increase in coming years. The rate of increase, howev-
er, could be reduced by improving the efficiency with
which oil is used in the economy and by substituting
alternative fuels.

Security of oil supplies is enhanced by a supportive for-
eign policy and appropriate military capabilities. We
will work to improve understanding among key partici-
pants in the oil industry of the basic fundamentals of
the oil market. We will also maintain our capability to
respond to requests to protect vital oil facilities, on land
or at sea, while working to resolve the underlying polit-
ical, social and economic tensions that could threaten
the free flow of oil.

The stability of the Gulf region, which contains two-
thirds of the world’s known oil reserves, is of funda-
mental concern to us. Political and military turbulence
in the region has a direct impact on our economy,
largely through higher oil prices and potential supply
disruptions. Diversification of both productive and
spare capacity is important to providing a cushion to
the oil market. Increased production, in an environ-
mentally sound manner, from other areas would also
contribute to the security of oil supplies.

Because energy markets — particularly the oil market
— are global, our energy security requires close coop-
eration among energy consumers. The aftermath of
Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait demonstrates the need to
improve strategic stock levels within oil-consuming
countries and the value of international cooperation to
help mitigate damage brought about by sudden, serious
disruptions of supply. The United States should develop
creative mechanisms to fill its Strategic Petroleum
Reserve to the statutorily required one billion barrels,
consistent with sound budgetary practices and avoiding
an unnecessary burden on the oil market.

21

 

Our use of oil is the key source of our vulnerability to
world oil supply disruption. To reduce this vulnerabili-
ty, we must work to both reduce oi! consumption and
to use oil more efficiently. The efficient use of energy in
all sectors of our economy is of particular importance.
We must intensify the development of alternative
sources of energy (nuclear, natural gas, coal and renew-
ables) and support aggressive research and develop-
ment of advanced energy technologies to provide the
clean, affordable, reliable energy supplies we will need
in the mid-21st century.

To meet pressing environmental concerns, we must
limit the harmful effects of energy production, trans-
portation and use. The increased, safe use of nuclear
power, for example, can significantly reduce green-
house gas emissions.

THE ENVIRONMENT

We must manage the Earth’s natural resources in ways
that protect the potential for growth and opportunity for
present and future generations. The experience of the
past half-century has taught that democratic political
institutions and free market economies enhance human
well-being. But even as we experience political and
economic success, we cannot ignore the costs that
growth, unguided by wisdom, can impose on our natu-
ral environment. A healthy economy and a healthy
environment go hand-in-hand. Solutions must be found
that protect our environment while allowing for the
economic development needed to improve the living
standards of a growing world population.

Global environmental concerns include such diverse
but interrelated issues as stratospheric ozone depletion,
climate change, food security, water supply, deforesta-
tion, biodiversity and treatment of wastes. A common
ingredient in each is that they respect no international
boundaries. The stress from these environmental chal-
lenges is already contributing to political conflict.
Recognizing a shared responsibility for global steward-
ship is a necessary step for global progress. Our part-
ners will find the United States a ready and active par-
ticipant in this effort. :

SPACE

The time has come to look beyond brief space
encounters and to commit to a future in which
Americans and citizens of all nations live and work in

22

 

space. We have developed a plan to make this vision a
reality and the National Space Council, under Vice
President Quayle, is charged with bringing coherence,
continuity and commitment to our efforts. We have
made solid progress in the five key elements of our
space strategy:

¢ Developing our space launch capability as a nation-
al resource: This infrastructure will be to the 21st
century what the great highway and dam projects
were to the 20th. Reliable space launchers will pro-
vide the “highway” to space and the solar system in
the next century.

© Expanding human presence and activity beyond
earth orbit and into the Solar System: We are well
underway with unmanned exploration of the Solar
System. Magellan, Viking and Voyager have been
spectacular successes, Galileo is on its way to
Jupiter, Ulysses has launched on its wide-ranging
orbit of the sun and soon we will begin missions to
Saturn and the Asteroid Belt. The Space Exploration
Initiative will build on the successes and expertise
developed in the Apollo, Skylab, Space Shuttle and
eventually the Space Station Freedom programs, ulti-
mately establishing permanent human settlements
on the Moon and putting humans on Mars.

© Obtaining scientific, technological and economic
benefits and improving the quality of life on earth:
Communications satellites already link people
around the globe; their contribution to the free flow
of information and ideas played a part in the
Revolution of ‘89. We also use space systems to veri-
fy arms control treaties. But the potential of space to
improve life on earth has barely been tapped. A very
promising application is in the area of the environ-
ment — monitoring and helping to understand the
process of ecological change, and holding signifi-
cant promise for new sources of energy, material and
products.

© Capitalizing on the unique environment of space to
foster economic well-being: Private investment in
space will create jobs, boost the economy and
strengthen our scientific, engineering and industrial
base. New commercial markets will be created, and
existing industries will become stronger and more
competitive in the world marketplace. The recently
approved commercial launch policy is a first step in
this process.

 

 

¢ Ensuring the freedom of space for exploration and
development: There are now some ten significant
spacefaring nations, with others on the way. Space
will become in the future what oceans have always
been — highways to discovery and commerce. But
as with sea lanes, space lanes can be closed and can
even be used as springboards for attack. We must
ensure the freedom to use space for exploration and
development, for ourselves and all nations.

 

Assured access to space requires a healthy military
space program. We must be able to monitor events in
space, warn of threats and intervene to protect impor-
tant space assets. This protection may take the form of
passive measures to enhance the survivability of critical
systems. We must also have the option of active
defense systems, including an anti-satellite system, to
stop an aggressor before he can use a space system to
threaten objects or people in or from space.

23

 

 

V. Relating Means to Ends: A Defense
Agenda for the 1990s

As the war to liberate Kuwait clearly showed, the
essential demands on our military forces — to deter
conflict whenever possible but to prevail in those that
do arise — are certain to endure. Nonetheless, the spe-
cific challenges facing our military in the 1990s and
beyond will be different from those that have dominat-
ed our thinking for the past 40 years.

In a world less driven by an immediate, massive threat
to Europe or the danger of global war, the need to sup-
port a smaller but still crucial forward presence and to
deal with regional contingencies — including possibly
a limited, conventional threat to Europe — will shape
how we organize, equip, train, deploy and employ our
active and reserve forces. We must also have the ability
to reconstitute forces, if necessary, to counter any resur-
gent global threat.

As the war in the Gulf made clear, the easing of the
Soviet threat does not mean an end to all hazards. As
we seek to build a new world order in the aftermath of
the Cold War, we will likely discover that the enemy
we face is less an expansionist communism than it is
instability itself. And, in the face of multiple and varied
threats to stability, we will increasingly find our military
strength a source of reassurance and a foundation for
security, regionally and globally.

In the face of competing fiscal demands and a changing
but still dangerous world, we have developed a new
defense strategy that provides the conceptual frame-
work for our future forces. This new strategy will guide
our deliberate reductions to no more than the forces we
need to defend our interests and meet our global!
responsibilities. It will also guide our restructuring so
that our remaining forces are appropriate to the chal-
lenges of a new era. The four fundamental demands of
a new era are already clear: to ensure strategic deter-

 

 

rence, to exercise forward presence in key areas, to
respond effectively to crises and to retain the national
capacity to reconstitute forces should this ever be need-
ed.

NUCLEAR DETERRENCE

Deterrence will indeed be enhanced as a result of the
START Treaty and U.S. force modernization efforts can
go forward with greater knowledge and predictability
about future Soviet forces. Nevertheless, even with the
Treaty, Soviet nuclear capabilities will remain substan-
tialf. Despite economic and political difficulties, the
Soviet Union continues its modernization of strategic
forces. Even in a new era, deterring nuclear attack
remains the number one defense priority of the United
States.

Strategic Nuclear Forces

The modernization of our Triad of land-based missiles,
strategic bombers and submarine-launched missiles
will be vital to the effectiveness of our deterrent in the
next century. We need to complete the Trident subma-
rine program with the eighteen boats and modern
missiles necessary to ensure a survivable force. The B-2
strategic bomber must be deployed so that the flexibili-
ty traditionally provided by the bomber force will be
available in the future. The B-2 will also firmly plant
our aerospace industry in a new era of low-observable
technology and the bomber itself will have unique
value across the spectrum of conflict. Finally, we must
continue the development of land-based, mobile
ICBMs in order to keep our deployment options open.

Our command, control and communications capabili-
ties are critical to nuclear deterrence and to ensuring
the survivability of our constitutional government under

25

 

 

all circumstances of attack. Our civil defense program
is still needed to deal with the consequences of an
attack, while also providing important capabilities to
respond to natural and man-made catastrophes.

The safety, security, control and effectiveness of United
States nuclear weapon systems are also of paramount
importance. We are incorporating the most modern
safety and control features into our deterrent stockpile
as rapidly as practicable and developing new safety
technologies for future weapons. Older weapons that
lack the most modern safety features are being replaced
or retired.

Testing of nuclear weapons plays a key part in assuring
the safety and effectiveness of our deterrent forces.
While we test only as much as is required for national
security purposes, testing is essential to ensure the relia-
bility and effectiveness of our weapons, to identify any
safety issues and to prove any corrective measures. A
halt to nuclear testing would not eliminate weapons or
increase security, but it would erode confidence in our
deterrent and severely restrict our ability to make
improvements, especially in nuclear safety.

Just as our weapons must be safe, the facilities that pro-
duce them must be safe, efficient, economical, and
environmentally sound. Our current facilities are being
renovated and brought up to modern standards. At the
same time we are moving forward to consolidate and
reconfigure the current large and older complex, look-
ing toward one that will be smaller, more flexible and
more efficient. Our production complex must be able
to respond to potential needs ranging from accelerated
production to accelerated retirement of weapons,
depending on the security environment in the years
ahead.

We must also recognize that the deterrence issues of a
new era are now at hand. Despite the threat still posed
by the existence of Soviet nuclear weapons, the likeli-
hood of their deliberate use by the Soviet state is
declining and the scenario which we frequently pro-
jected as the precursor of their use — massive war in
Europe — is less likely than at any other time since
World War Il. These developments affect questions of
nuclear targeting, the alert status and operational pro-
cedures of our forces and ultimately the type and num-
ber of weapons sufficient to ensure our safety and that
of our allies. We have already begun to make adjust-
ments to our nuclear forces and to the policies that

26

 

guide them in recognition of the disintegration of the
Warsaw Pact and changes in the Soviet Union itself.
Beyond this, while we have traditionally focused on
deterring a unitary, rational actor applying a relatively
knowable calculus of potential costs and gains, our
thinking must now encompass potential instabilities
within states as well as the potential threat from states
or leaders who might perceive they have little to lose in
employing weapons of mass destruction.

Non-Strategic Nuclear Forces

Below the |evel of strategic forces, we have traditional-
ly maintained other nuclear forces for a variety of pur-
poses. They have highlighted our resolve and have
helped to link conventional defense to the broader
strategic nuclear guarantee of the United States. This
has helped remove incentives that otherwise might
have accelerated nuclear proliferation. These systems
have also served to deter an enemy’s use of such
weapons and they have contributed to the deterrence
of conventional attack. These needs persist.

In Europe, we and our allies have always sought the
lowest number and most stable types of weapons need-
ed to prevent war. Indeed, NATO has unilaterally
reduced thousands of nuclear weapons over the past
decade, in addition to the elimination of an entire class
of U.S. and Soviet weapons as called for in the Treaty
on Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces. Changes in
Europe have now allowed us to forgo plans to modern-
ize our LANCE missiles and nuclear artillery shells and
we will work to implement the commitments of the
London Declaration with respect to short-range nuclear
weapons currently deployed in Europe.

Even with the dramatic changes we see in Europe,
however, non-strategic nuclear weapons remain inte-
gral to our strategy of deterrence. They make NATO's
resolve unmistakably clear and help prevent war by
ensuring that there are no circumstances in which a
nuclear response to military action might be discount-
ed. In practical terms, this means greater reliance on
aircraft armed with modern weapons. As the principal
means by which Alliance members share nuclear risks
and burdens, these aircraft and their weapons must be
based in Europe. Such a posture is not designed to
threaten any European state but to provide a secure
deterrent in the face of unforeseen circumstances.

 

 

Missile Defenses

Flexible response and deterrence through the threat of
retaliation have preserved the security of the United
States and its allies for decades. In the early 1980s, we
began the Strategic Defense Initiative in the face of an
unconstrained Soviet ballistic-missile program and a
significant Soviet commitment to strategic defenses. SDI
was intended to shift deterrence to a safer, more stable
basis as effective strategic defenses would diminish the
confidence of an adversary in his ability to execute a
successful attack.

Notwithstanding the continued modernization of Soviet
offensive forces and the pursuit of more effective strate-
gic defenses, the positive changes in our relationship
with the Soviet Union and the fundamental changes in
Eastern Europe have markedly reduced the danger of a
war in Europe that could escalate to the strategic nucle-
ar level. At the same time, the threat posed by global
ballistic-missile proliferation and by an accidental or
unauthorized launch resulting from political turmoil
has grown considerably. Thus, the United States, our
forces, and our allies and friends face a continued and
even growing threat from ballistic missiles.

In response to these trends, we have redirected SDI to
pursue a system providing Global Protection Against
Limited Strikes (GPALS). With adequate funding, it will
be possible to begin to deploy systems that will better
protect our troops in the field from ballistic-missile
attack by the mid-1990s and that will protect the
United States itself from such attacks by the turn of the
century. GPALS is designed to provide protection
against a ballistic missile launched from anywhere
against a target anywhere in the world. The system will
be based on technologies which SDI has pioneered, but
would be both smaller and less expensive than the ini-
tial deployment originally projected for SDI.

GPALS offers many potential advantages: the United
States would be protected against limited strikes by bal-
listic missiles; our forward-deployed forces would be
better defended against missile attacks; and our allies,
many of whom lie on the edge of troubled areas, could
also be better protected. The record of the PATRIOT
against Iraqi SCUDs highlights the great potential for
defenses against ballistic missiles, the critical role of
missile defenses and the need to improve such defenses
further.

 

 

GPALS could also provide incentives against further
proliferation of ballistic missiles. If these missiles did
not hold the potential to cause certain and immediate
damage, nations might be less likely to go to such great
lengths to acquire them. Access to U.S. assistance in
defenses may also provide an incentive for countries
not to seek ballistic missiles or weapons of mass
destruction.

FORWARD PRESENCE

Maintaining a positive influence in distant regions
requires that we demonstrate our engagement. The for-
ward presence of our military forces often provides the
essential glue in important alliance relationships and
signals that our commitments are backed by tangible
actions. Our presence can deter aggression, preserve
regional balances, deflect arms races and prevent the
power vacuums that invite conflict. While our forward
deployments will be reduced in the future, the prudent
forward basing of forces and the prepositioning of
equipment reduce the burden of projecting power from
the continental United States. Indeed, certain regions
— like Europe and East Asia — represent such com-
pelling interests to the United States that they will
demand the permanent deployment of some U.S. forces
for as long as they are needed and welcomed by our
allies as part of a common effort. But even in these
regions, the size of our forward deployments can be
smaller as the threat diminishes and the defense capa-
bilities of our allies improve. In other regions our pres-
ence, while important, can take less permanent forms.

Across the Atlantic: Europe
and the Middle East

In Europe, Soviet reductions and the dissolution of the
Warsaw Pact allow us to scale back our presence to a
smaller, but still significant, contribution to NATO’s
overall force levels. This presence will include the
equivalent of a robust army corps, with a corps head-
quarters, associated corps units, and two ground force
divisions supplemented by several air wings, appropri-
ate naval forces, and sufficient infrastructure to support
a return of additional forces. Such a force will preserve
the operational, not just symbolic, significance of our
presence.

As called for in July at the London NATO Summit, we
will work with our allies to make our forces in Europe

27

 

more flexible and mobile and more fully integrated into
multinational formations. NATO will establish a multi-
national Rapid Reaction Corps to respond to crises and
we expect Alliance forces, including those of the
United States, to be organized into multinational corps
that would function in peacetime, and not just be con-
tingent structures activated in a crisis. We will also
exploit the prospect of longer warning time in the event
of a major crisis by backing up our deployed forces
with the ability to reinforce them with active and
reserve units from the United States, supported by the
ability to reconstitute larger forces over time should the
need arise.

The aftermath of the crisis in the Gulf portends a need
for some measure of continuing presence in that region
consistent with the desires and needs of our friends.
While the United States will not maintain a permanent
ground presence, we are committed to the region’s
security. We will work with our friends to bolster their
confidence and security through such measures as
exercises, prepositioning of heavy equipment and an
enhanced naval presence. Our vital national interests
depend on a stable and secure Gulf.

Across the Pacific

Our enduring interests in East Asia and the Pacific also
demand forces sufficient to meet our responsibilities
and to sustain our long-term relationships with friends
and allies. While East Asia has been considerably less
affected by the Revolution of ‘89 than Europe, the
growing strength and self-reliance of our friends in the
region permit some reduction in our presence.

A phased approach, responding to global and regional
events, is the soundest. We have announced our intent
to adjust military personnel levels in the Philippines,
the Republic of Korea and Japan. This phase is
designed to thin out existing force structure and

reshape our security relationships. Before this phase
ends in December 1992, over 15,000 U.S. personnel
will be withdrawn. Later phases will reduce and reorga-
nize our force structure further, as circumstances per-
mit.

Korea represents the area of greatest potential danger,
and reductions there must be carefully measured
against North Korean actions. However, we have
judged that the growing strength of our Korean allies
permits us to reduce our presence and begin to move

28

 

toward a security partnership in which the Korean
armed forces assume the leading role. We are also
encouraged by the progress of the Japanese
Government in rounding out its own self-defense capa-
bilities.

The Rest of the World

In other regions, as the need for our presence persists,
we will increasingly rely on periodic visits, training
missions, access agreements, prepositioned equipment,
exercises, combined planning and security and human-
itarian assistance to sustain the sense of common inter-
est and cooperation on which we would rely in deploy-
ing and employing our military forces. As the Gulf crisis
clearly showed, our strategy is increasingly dependent
on the support of regional friends and allies. In fact —
during crises — the cooperation and support of those
local states most directly threatened will be critical fac-
tors in determining our own course of action.

CRISIS RESPONSE

Despite our best efforts to deter conflict, we must be
prepared for our interests to be challenged with force,
often with little or no warning. The Gulf crisis was
ample evidence that such challenges will not always be
small or easily resolved. Because regional crises are the
predominant military threat we will face inthe future,
their demands — along with our forward presence
requirements — will be the primary determinant of the
size and structure of our future forces.

The regional contingencies we could face are many
and varied. We must be prepared for differences in ter-
rain, climate and the nature of threatening forces, as
well as for differing levels of support from host nations
or others. We must also be able to respond quickly and
effectively to adversaries who may possess cruise mis-
siles, modern air defenses, chemical weapons, ballistic
missiles and even large armor formations. Although our
forward deployed forces speed our ability to respond to
threats in areas like the Pacific or Europe, there are
other regions where threats, while likely to be less
formidable, may prove no less urgent.

Mobility

In this new era, therefore, the ability to project our
power will underpin our strategy more than ever. We
must be able to deploy substantial forces and sustain

 

them in parts of the world where prepositioning of
equipment will not always be feasible, where adequate
bases may not be available (at least before a crisis) and
where there is a less developed industrial base and
infrastructure to support our forces once they have
arrived. Our strategy demands we be able to move men
and materiel to the scene of a crisis at a pace and in
numbers sufficient to field an overwhelming force. The
100-hour success of our ground forces in the war to lib-
erate Kuwait was stunning, but we should not allow it
to obscure the fact that we required six months to
deploy these forces. As our overall force levels draw
down and our forward-deployed forces shrink, we must
sustain and expand our investment in airlift, sealift and
— where possible — prepositioning. We must also
ensure unimpeded transit of the air and sea lanes and
access to space through maritime and aerospace supe-
riority. Our security assistance must, among other
things, enhance the ability of other nations to facilitate
our deployments. And, over the longer term, we must
challenge our technology to develop forces that are
lethal but more readily deployable and more easily sus-
tained than today’s.

Readiness and Our Guard
and Reserve Forces

For almost two decades, our Total Force Policy has
placed a substantial portion of our military manpower
in high-quality, well-trained, well-equipped and early-
mobilizing Guard and Reserve units. Compared to
maintaining such a force in the active component, this
was a cost-effective strategy, a prudent response to an
international security environment where the predomi-
nant threat was major conflict in Europe or global war
with the Soviets, with warning of such a conflict mea-
sured in weeks or even days.

That environment has been transformed. Today we
must reshape our Guard and Reserve forces so that they
can continue their important contributions in new cir-
cumstances. While we still face the possibility of sud-
den conflict in many of the regional contingencies that
could concern us, these threats — despite their danger
— will be on a smaller scale than the threat formerly
posed by the Soviets and their Warsaw Pact allies. This
will allow a smaller force overall, but those units ori-
ented towards short-warning, regional contingencies
must be kept at high readiness.

 

 

Over time we will move to a Total Force that permits us
to respond initially to any regional contingency with
units — combat and support — drawn wholly from the
active component, except for a limited number of sup-
port and mobility assets. Since many support functions
can be more economically maintained in the reserve
component, we will still rely on reserve support units in
any extended confrontation. The primary focus of
reserve combat units will be to supplement active units
in any especially large or protracted deployment. To
hedge against a future need for expanded forces to deal
with a renewed global confrontation, which — though
possible — is less likely and clearly less immediate
than previously calculated, some reserve combat units
will be retained in cadre status.

This approach will allow us to maintain a Total Force
appropriate for the strategic and fiscal demands of a
new era: a smaller, more self-contained and very ready
active force able to respond quickly to emerging
threats; and a reduced but still essential reserve compo-
nent with emphasis on supporting and sustaining active
combat forces, and — in particularly large or prolonged
regional contingencies — providing latent combat
capability that can be made ready when needed.

Even as we restructure for a new era, we will continue
to place a premium on the quality of our military per-
sonnel, the backbone of any effective fighting force.
True military power is measured by the professional
skills and dedication of our young men and women. In
six weeks and 100 decisive hours, today’s military
proved it is the most skilled and effective fighting force
this Nation has ever possessed. As we make the adjust-
ments appropriate to a new environment, we will pre-
serve this precious resource.

RECONSTITUTION

Beyond the crisis response capabilities provided by
active and reserve forces, we must have the ability to
generate wholly new forces should the need arise.
Although we are hopeful for the future, history teaches
us caution. The 20th century has seen rapid shifts in the
geopolitical climate, and technology has repeatedly
transformed the battlefield. The ability to reconstitute is
what allows us safely and selectively to scale back and”
restructure our forces in-being.

This difficult task will require us to invest in hedging
options whose future dividends may not always be

29

 

measurable now. It will require careful attention to the
vital elements of our military potential: the industrial
base, science and technology, and manpower. These
elements were easily accommodated in an era when
we had to maintain large standing forces, when we rou-
tinely invested heavily in defense R&D and when new
items of equipment were broadly and extensively pro-
duced. We will now have to work much more deliber-
ately to preserve them.

The standard by which we should measure our efforts is
the response time that our warning processes would
provide us of a return to previous levels of confronta-
tion in Europe or in the world at large. We and our
allies must be able to reconstitute a credible defense
faster than any potential opponent can generate an
overwhelming offense.

Manpower

Reconstitution obviously includes manpower.
Relatively large numbers of personnel, trained in basic
military skills, can be raised in one to two years. But
skilled, seasoned leaders — high-quality senior NCOs
and officers — require many years to develop and we
must preserve this critical nucleus to lead an expanding
military force. This must be reflected in how we man
active, reserve and cadre units over the long term.

Defense Technology

Another challenge will be to maintain our edge in
defense technology, even as we reduce our forces.
Technology has historically been a comparative advan-
tage for American forces, and we have often relied on it
to overcome numerical disparities and to reduce the
risk to American lives.

Our technological edge in key areas of warfare will be
even more important at lower levels of forces and fund-
ing, and in the complex political and military environ-
ment in which our forces will operate. But maintaining
this margin will become increasingly difficult as access
to advanced weaponry spreads and as our defense
industry shrinks. Even in regional contingencies it will
not be uncommon for our forces to face high-technolo-
gy weapons in the hands of adversaries. This spread of
advanced systems will surely erode the deterrent value
of our own — and our competitive edge in warfare —
unless we act decisively to maintain technological
superiority.

30

 

We will, of course, have to decide which technologies
we want to advance and how we will pursue them.
Our focus should be on promising, high-leverage areas,
especially those that play to our comparative advan-
tages and exploit the weaknesses of potential adver-
saries, whoever and wherever they may be. Stealth,
space-based systems, sensors, precision weapons,
advanced training technologies — all these proved
themselves in the Gulf, yet when these programs (and
others) were begun, no one foresaw their use against
Iraq. Our investment strategies must hedge against the
unknown, giving future Presidents the flexibility that
such capabilities provide.

We must be able to move promising research through
development to rapid fielding when changes in the
international environment so require. The “generation
leaps” in technology and fielded systems that some
have suggested may not be possible. We will have to
build some systems, as the early production effort is a
vital component of technology development.
Production, even in limited numbers, will also facilitate
the development of innovative doctrine and organiza-
tional structures to make full use of the new technolo-
gies we field. In an era of tight fiscal constraints, our
development efforts must also strive to make our
weapons less expensive as well as more effective.

In the competition for scarce resources, emphasis on
technology development — to pursue those new capa-
bilities that may be most decisive in the longer term —
may mean accepting some continued risk in the near
term. But accepting such risk may well be prudent in a
period of reduced East-West tensions.

The Industrial Base

Providing and sustaining modern equipment to support
a rapid expansion of the armed forces is an equally dif-
ficult proposition. We will need a production base to
produce new systems and a maintenance and repair
base to support them. These requirements pose unique
problems, as reduced defense budgets are shrinking the
defense industrial sector overall. As we make procure-
ment and investment decisions, we will have to place a
value on the assured supply and timely delivery of
defense materials in time of crisis.

In the near term, some of these problems can be ame-
liorated by retaining and storing equipment from units
being deactivated. Over the longer term, however, as

 

 

stored equipment becomes obsolete, the issue becomes
our capability to expand production or use alternative
sources of supply. We will need the capacity for indus-
trial surge, accelerating orders that are already in the
pipeline. We will also have to plan for production from
new or alternative industrial capacity. It may also be
possible to reduce unneeded military specifications to
make greater use of items that can be created by the
commercial production base. Above all, we must con-
tinue to involve the creative resources of our national
economy and ensure that corporations continue to
have incentives to engage in innovative defense work.

A SMALLER AND
RESTRUCTURED FORCE

Our future military will be smaller. Assuming there are
no unforeseen, worrisome trends in the security envi-
ronment, by mid-decade our force can be some 25 per-
cent smaller than the force we maintained in the last
days of the Cold War. The changes we have seen in the
overall international environment have made this
smaller force possible, and the increasing demands on
our resources to preserve the other elements of our
national strength have made it necessary.

Minimum Essential Military
Forces — The Base Force

Yet these planned reductions will cut our forces to a
minimally acceptable level — to a Base Force below
which further reductions would not be prudent. These
minimum forces represent our national security insur-
ance policy and consist of four basic force packages:
Strategic Forces, Atlantic Forces, Pacific Forces and
Contingency Forces.

Our Strategic Forces must continue to meet the endur-
ing demands of nuclear deterrence and defense. The
conventional force packages provide forces for forward

 

 

presence as well as the ability to respond to crises. Our
Atlantic Forces will be postured and trained for the
heavy threats characteristic of Europe and Southwest
Asia and must be modern and lethal enough to deal
with these threats. Pacific Forces will be structured for
an essentially maritime theater, placing a premium on
naval capabilities, backed by the essential air and
ground forces for enduring deterrence and immediate
crisis response. U.S.-based reinforcements will be
lighter than those we envisage for the Atlantic, as befits
the potential contingencies in the Pacific. Contingency
Forces will include the Army’s light and airborne units,
Marine expeditionary brigades, special operations
forces and selected air and naval assets. They will be
largely based in the United States and — since they
must be able to respond to spontaneous and unpre-
dictable crises — they will largely be in the active com-
ponent. At times, the quick deployment of such a force
in itself may be enough to head off confrontation. At
other times, we may need actually to employ this force
to deal with insurgencies, conduct anti-drug or anti-ter-
rorist operations, evacuate non-combatants or — as we
did in Desert Shield — be the first into action while
heavier forces are alerted and moved.

The reductions projected by the mid-1990s are dramat-
ic. It will be important to manage their pace rationally
and responsibly. We must accommodate the actions
taken in support of Desert Storm and Desert Shield and
we must be attentive to the professional skills of the
armed forces that have been built up over the past
decade — and which, as the war made clear, remain
vital to our national security. But now that the war has
been won, and as long as no unanticipated ominous
trends emerge, we will get back on the spending path
agreed to before hostilities began. Highly effective mili-
tary forces can be supported within the levels agreed to
by Congress in the 1990 Budget Agreement if we can
end unneeded programs, consolidate bases, streamline
procedures and adjust overall manpower levels without
arbitrary restrictions.

31

 

VI. Toward the 21st Century

The 20th century has taught us that security is indivisi-
ble. The safety, freedom and well-being of one people
cannot be separated from the safety, freedom and well-
being of all. Recently, the Gulf crisis strengthened this
sense of international community. Many of the underly-
ing forces now at work in the world are tending to draw
that global community even closer together.
Technology, especially the explosion of communication
and information, has accelerated the pace of human
contact. The growing acceptance of the democratic
ideal — evidenced in the erosion of totalitarianism and
the expansion of basic human freedoms — has also
brought the world closer together. The expansion of
commerce and the growing acceptance of market prin-
ciples have accelerated the movement toward interde-
pendence and the integration of economies. Even the
threats posed by the proliferation of weapons of enor-
mous destructiveness have begun to draw the commu-
nity of nations together in common concern.

As we move toward the 21st century, this interdepen-
dence of peoples will grow and will continue to
demand responsible American leadership. Guided by
the values that have inspired and nurtured our democ-
racy at home, we will work for a new world in which
peace, security and cooperation finally replace the con-
frontation of the Cold War, and overcome the kind of
threat represented by Iraq’s aggression.

Developments in the Soviet Union and elsewhere have
set in motion a change in the strategic landscape as
dramatic as that which the Nation experienced when
Soviet policy first forced the Cold War upon us. The
great threat to global peace has ebbed and we now see
a Soviet state and society struggling to overcome severe
internal crisis. Notwithstanding the uncertainties about
the future course of the Soviet Union, that state’s will-
ingness — indeed, in many ways, its ability — to pro-

 

ject power beyond its borders has been dramatically
reduced for the foreseeable future. Our strategy for this
new era recognizes the opportunities and challenges
before us, and includes among its principles:

© reinforcing the moral ties that hold our alliances
together, even as perceptions of a common security
threat change;

* encouraging the constructive evolution of the Soviet
Union, recognizing the limits of our influence and
the continuing power of Soviet military forces;

* supporting the independence and vitality of the new
Eastern European democracies even as we deal with
the uncertainties of the Soviet future;

¢ championing the principles of political and econom-
ic freedom as the surest guarantors of human
progress and happiness, as well as global peace;

¢ working with others in the global community to
resolve regional disputes and stem the proliferation
of advanced weapons;

* cooperating with the Soviet Union and others in
achieving arms control agreements that promote
security and stability;

* reducing our defense burden as appropriate, while
restructuring our forces for new challenges;

¢ tending more carefully to our own economic com-
petitiveness as the foundation of our long-term
strength; and

¢ addressing the new global agenda of refugee flows,
drug abuse and environmental! degradation.

33

 

 

We are a rich and powerful nation, and the elements of
our power will remain formidable. But our wealth and
our strength are not without limits. We must balance
our commitments with our means and, above all, we
must wisely choose now which elements of our
strength will best serve our needs in the future. This is
the challenge of strategy.

In this country we make such choices for peace just as
we make the awful choices of war — as a democracy.
When President and Congress work together to build
an effective security posture and policy — as was done
in the 1980s — we are successful. In the Gulf, our
armed forces benefitted from the legacy of investment
decisions, technological innovations, and strategic
planning that came in the decade before. Today’s plan-
ning decisions will determine whether we are well or ill

34

 

prepared for the contingencies that will confront us in
the future.

This is a heavy responsibility, shared between the
President and Congress. We owe our servicemen and
women not only the best equipment, but also a coher-
ent strategy and posture geared to new realities. This
coherence can only come from a partnership between
the Branches. Divided, we will invite disasters. United,
we can overcome any challenge.

In the Gulf, the dictator guessed wrong when he doubt-
ed America’s unity and will. The extraordinary unity we
showed as a Nation in the Gulf assured that we would
prevail. It also sent the message loud and clear that
America is prepared for the challenges of the future,
committed and engaged in the world, as a reliable ally,
friend and leader.

Preface

American Leadership for
Peaceful Change

Our great Nation stands at a crossroads in history. We
have entered a world radically transformed in the last four
years. We have only to consider the following to under-
stand the fact that we have moved, in that short time span,
from one historical period into another:

© People and nations are introducing democratic and free
market institutions and values.

© Only a few years ago, Central America, Southeast Asia,
Southern Africa, and the Middle East were trapped in a
cycle of intractable violence and human misery. Today,
with the help of America, all are on the road to peace.

© The barbed wire fences and minefields that once divid-
ed Europe are no more. Millions of people on the other
side of the Iron Curtain have been liberated from tyran-
ny. With American help, the nations of Central and
Eastern Europe have begun to taste political and eco-
nomic freedom.

* Our former nemesis, the Soviet Union, so long an
enemy bristling with tanks pointed at Western Europe
and nuclear missiles aimed at us, is gone. The threat of
thermonuclear war has been radically reduced and the
danger that Soviet expansionism posed for forty years
has disappeared as well.

¢ The Communist ideology that reigned supreme from the
Brandenburg Gate to the Bering Strait is today, in most
of the world, discredited, despised, and discarded.

* The flow of oil vital to the economic well-being of the
United States and the industrialized world is secured.

 

Few of these achievements would have been possible with-
out the leadership of the United States of America. They
are testament to our enduring political, moral, economic,
and military strength. They are testament to our strategy of
containment and deterrence, to the dedication and sacri-
fice of the brave men and women of our armed forces, to
our foreign assistance programs and our diplomacy, and to
the support and spirit of the American people. More than
anything else, our achievements are testament to the values
that define us as a Nation — freedom, compassion, justice,
opportunity, the rule of law, and hope. The impoverished,
the oppressed, and the weak have always looked to the
United States to be strong, to be capable, and to care.
Perhaps more than anything else, they have depended on
us to lead. And lead we have.

We are indeed moving into a new era. It is an era that
holds great opportunities — but also great dangers.
America has a fateful choice to make. We can choose to
lead the world into this most historic of transformations, or
we can choose, as we have earlier in this century, to turn
inward, abandon our leadership role, and accept whatever
results may follow. If we choose leadership, America can
seize the opportunities that will be offered, and reduce the
dangers that will surely confront us. Although we will
work with other nations, our status as the preeminent world
power with unique capabilities places great responsibilities
upon us. And, if we are to learn anything from the often
tragic history of this century, it is first that the future is
uncertain, and second, that the world needs the leadership
that only America can provide.

 

As the continuing turmoil in virtually every region of the
world underscores, we have not achieved a permanent
peace. Although the forces of integration are stronger than
ever, new and in some cases dormant forces of fragmenta-
tion have also been unleashed. Even as the danger of glob-
al war recedes, the potential for smaller but still highly
destructive conflicts between nations and within nations is
growing. We simply do not and cannot know all the chal-
lenges that will arise in the future. What we do know is
that our citizens and our interests will be challenged again.
We must remain strong enough to protect and defend them.

We live in an interdependent world in which our hopes for
peace and prosperity at home are increasingly linked to the
success of our policies abroad. Looking to the future, our
success at home will depend more — not less — on the
same kind of global leadership we exercised throughout
the second half of the 20th century. It is equally clear that
America cannot hope to achieve its foreign policy goals
nor maintain its credibility abroad if it does not sustain its
economic dynamism and competitiveness at home. Thus,
renewing our domestic vitality — in economic productivi-
ty, investment, technology, education, and energy — is an
absolute prerequisite for our future.

 

Our policy has one overriding goal: real peace — not the
illusory and fragile peace maintained by a balance of ter-
ror, but an enduring democratic peace based on shared
values. Such a peace can only exist if it is based on the
rule of law. This is the peace we have enjoyed for decades
with former enemies such as Germany and Japan. It is the
peace we hope to forge with more recent adversaries of the
Warsaw Pact. It is the peace and liberty we wish upon
every region of the world, enabling free peoples and free
economies everywhere to flourish and to prosper.

Building such a peace is an historic challenge. In a few
short years, we have come farther than many would have
imagined possible. But we still have far to go if historians
are to look back on the end of the 20th Century as the
beginning of an “Age of Democratic Peace.”

This is no Jess than a summons to national greatness. But
meeting renewed and nearly impossible challenges is what
America is all about. 1, for one, am fully confident in our
success. Let us enter this challenging period of transition to
a new era determined by our leadership and our commit-
ment that we, our children and grandchildren will live in
prosperity and security.

|. The World As It Is...

Our National Security Challenges

and Opportunities

The collapse of the Soviet Union and our collective victory
in the Cold War have fundamentally changed the strategic
environment. That victory would have been impossible
without long-term American political, economic, and mili-
tary strength, without commitment and leadership, and
without strong, capable, and reliable allies. The new inter-
national environment has also been shaped by the victory
of the United States and its coalition allies in Iraq — the
first major post-Cold War conflict. Our experience in the
Gulf War demonstrated that we cannot be sure when or
where the next conflict will arise; that regions critical to our
interests must be defended; that the world must respond to
straightforward aggression; that international coalitions can
be forged, though they often will require American leader-
ship; that the proliferation of advanced weaponry repre-
sents a clear, present, and widespread danger; and that the
United States remains the nation whose strength and lead-
ership are essential to a stable and democratic world order.

The Challenges

Despite both these successes, the world remains a danger-
ous place. While we no longer face the single defining
threat which dominated our policy, budgets, force struc-
tures, and indeed our fears for forty years, multiple threats
to our security still remain. Today’s challenges are more
complex, ambiguous and diffuse than ever before. They
are political, economic, and military; unilateral and multi-
lateral; short-and long-term.

Politically, we are challenged to help ensure the successful
transition of newly emerged and emerging democracies in
Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Success in these efforts is vital to world stability. Fragile
democracies elsewhere must be nurtured to ensure that
there are no reversals in the process. Together with our
allies and friends, the United States must continue to foster

 

the Middle East peace process and to encourage democrat-
ic reform in China, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, and Cuba,
where one quarter of the earth’s population still lives under
Communist rule. We must also help shape our alliances as
well as regional and international structures to deal with
today’s realities and anticipate tomorrow’s challenges.
Every effort must be made to overcome chaos, and create
and sustain stability in a democratic international order.
Fundamentally, we must make clear America’s steadfast-
ness and eliminate any perception that we will turn inward
once again and renounce our mandate for global leadership.

Economically, in the international marketplace, we face the
continuing challenge of protecting and broadening open
markets and of formidable economic competitors such as
Japan and Germany. The challenges of change and the
transition to a more open competitive trading system
demand a more flexible and skilled workforce, a dedica-
tion to quality and cost-efficient production, and a commit-
ment to expand open and free trade. We need to save and
invest more. We need to inhibit environmental degrada-
tion which, if left unchecked, will have an adverse, long-
term economic impact.

Militarily, global security is threatened by regional instabili-
ties which we may have to confront either to protect our
own citizens and interests or at the request of our allies or
the United Nations. We are threatened by the continued
proliferation of advanced conventional arms, ballistic mis-
siles of increasing range, and weapons of mass destruction;
by terrorism; and by the international drug trade.
Longstanding missions, such as humanitarian assistance,
must now be undertaken in the midst of civil war and anar-
chy. Peacekeeping and peace enforcement are more com-
plex than ever. Finally, we must continue to support the
concept of democratic civilian authority over national mili-
tary institutions. Without civilian control, democracy can-
not exist.

 

The Opportunities

There is a peace dividend. The United States is no longer
burdened by the enormous military requirements of global
containment. We have an unprecedented opportunity to
promote our interests rather than simply defend them, to
address simultaneously our domestic needs, and indeed to
shape our future both at home and abroad. Our interna-
tional opportunities and our domestic imperatives are, in
fact, interdependent.

For the first time in more than forty years, we are no longer
faced with the constant threat of World War III.
Democracy has been embraced by a majority of countries
around the world and our former adversaries are now our
partners. We face the future enjoying not only great credi-
bility in the eyes of the world, but also with more, and in
many cases stronger, friends and allies than ever before to
help shoulder the responsibilities and burdens. Multilateral
institutions such as the United Nations, the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, NATO, the
Organization of American States, the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum and others are energized and
ready to confront new challenges. In combat and humani-
tarian operations, we have proven our ability to build
coalitions to achieve common objectives. Our economic
future lies more than ever in the global marketplace, our
economic well-being guaranteed by expanded trade
through such historic initiatives as the North American Free
Trade Agreement and the Uruguay Round of multilateral
trade talks.

We must seize our opportunities, both for the benefits that
will accrue to us, and to further the prospects for peace,

 

stability, and prosperity that can and should be shared by
others around the globe. We must lead because we can-
not otherwise hope to achieve a more democratic and
peaceful future in a world still rife with turmoil and con-
flict. If we shun this role, our own future will be shaped by
others.

The Domestic Imperative

In the final analysis, our national security requirements
must be viewed in the context of our overall national well-
being. While our underlying economic dynamism is
undoubted, we are challenged at home by government
budget deficits and a need to increase savings and invest-
ment. We need a tax and legal system that facilitates, not
burdens, economic progress. Our public infrastructure
requires substantial investment. We must overcome the
challenges of crime and drugs. We must ensure social
peace and racial harmony as national imperatives. We
must have an education system that makes our children the
equal of their international peers; we must promote job
training, improved health care, and welfare reform. Age-
old principles of personal responsibility, individual initia-
tive, and commitment to helping others must be strength-
ened.

Meeting the challenges of renewal at home only reaffirms
the need for continued American strength. At the same
time, the economic and social basis of our national
strength will be more important than ever before in deter-
mining our ability to be a force for good in the world.

 

Il. What We Seek ... Our National
Security Interests And Objectives

The vision of the world to which the United States aspires
is one of freedom, respect for human rights, free markets,
and the rule of law. Defining a new strategy to achieve
such a vision must begin with our national interests and
objectives, for these constitute the fundamental rationale
for all our domestic and international undertakings.

Foremost, the United States must ensure its security as a
free and independent nation, and the protection of its fun-
damental values, institutions, and people. This is a sover-
eign responsibility which we will not abdicate to any other
nation or collective organization.

Through a strategy of engagement and leadership, we seek:

¢ Global and regional stability which encourages peace-
ful change and progress. To this end, we have four
mutually supportive goals that guide our overall national
security efforts. These are protecting the United States
and its citizens from attack; honoring, strengthening,
and extending our historic, treaty and collective defense
arrangements; ensuring that no hostile power is able to
dominate or control a region critical to our interests;
and, working to avoid conflict by reducing sources of
regional instability and violence, limiting the prolifera-
tion of advanced military technology and weapons of
mass destruction, and strengthening civil-military institu-
tions while reducing the economic burdens of military
spending.

© Open, democratic and representative political systems
worldwide. In our own actions and in concert with oth-
ers, we should foster open and democratic systems that
secure human rights and respect for every citizen, and
work to strengthen respect for international norms of
conduct. The active promotion of increased political

 

 

participation, especially now in Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union, is in our national interest — history
teaches that representative governments responsive to
their people are least likely to turn to aggression against
their neighbors. Democracies also ensure individual
civil and human rights, support economic freedom, and
promote stability.

An open international trading and economic system
which benefits all participants. A global economic sys-
tem which encourages the free movement of goods,
capital and labor is also one which best contributes to
our prosperity and to that of others. Steady, non-infla-
tionary economic growth will help reduce social and
political tensions, thus contributing to global peace, and
will also provide a means for ensuring the health of our
environment.

An enduring global faith in America — that it can and
will lead in a collective response to the world’s crises.
This does not mean that the United States must tackle
every international problem as its own, or that we must
postpone addressing our own domestic imperatives
while we devote attention and resources to international
demands. But new democracies need our help to sur-
vive and flourish. That does not mean that we can solve
their problems or that our solutions should be theirs, but
rather that we cannot shirk our responsibility to help.
There are limits to what we can or should do — we will
have to be selective and discriminate in our global
undertakings. But others have responsibilities as well.
We also need to encourage the active engagement of
our allies and friends. But often these collective efforts
will not prove possible unless we take the lead. We
cannot ever allow our stated preference for multilateral
action to become simply an excuse for American inaction.

 

Ill. The Promotion Of Peace And
Democracy ... Our Policy Agenda

America has been blessed with an abundance of natural
and human resources and a people committed to freedom
and democracy. Because of our strength, others have been
able to lift themselves up from the ravages of war, improve
their economies, free themselves from totalitarianism, and
take the first hopeful steps toward a better way of life. In
today’s world, we face new and diverse international and
domestic challenges that will require flexibility in the com-
mitment of the various resources of national power and
influence. We must focus anew on meeting economic
challenges and on fostering democracy worldwide. Our
influence will increasingly be defined more by the quality
of our ideas, values, and leadership, and by our competi-
tiveness in the international marketplace, than by the pre-
dominance of our military capabilities.

What We Have Achieved

As we look back on more than four decades of Cold War,
the United States can be proud of many accomplishments.

Perhaps most important, by providing the stability that
allowed for peaceful change, we nurtured a democratic
community of nations — a “zone of peace” among the
Western Hemisphere, Western Europe, and Japan, Australia
and the newly industrializing economies of East Asia. In
Latin America, we have come very close to our goal of a
democratic hemisphere, with elected heads of government
in every country except Cuba, and the principle of the con-
sent of the governed now firmly established. Europe is
whole and free. Our continued presence in Asia centered
on our alliance with Japan has ensured unprecedented sta-
bility in the region.

In crafting a post-war foreign policy based on containment,
we defended the Free World against Communist expan-
sion and aggression. We provided an environment of

 

deterrence in which the Communist system succumbed to
its internal contradictions. We provided an inspiring politi-
cal and economic alternative which demonstrated the
bankruptcy of that system. We forged the strong military
alliances which helped maintain peace, manage crises, set-
tle conflicts and made containment work.

Remembering how in the 1930s economic conflicts exac-
erbated political conflict, the United States took the lead
in laying the foundation for a global economic system
based on multilateral cooperation, liberalized trade, inter-
national institutions for financial cooperation and develop-
ment assistance, and other mechanisms. These institutions
are proving their worth today in responding to the new
challenges of aiding the former Communist countries.

The United States has taken the lead both to defeat
aggression, notably in the Persian Gulf, and to promote
peaceful resolution of longstanding conflicts, such as in
the Middle East, which threaten international peace and
our vital interests.

And finally, for forty years, the United States served as
both symbol and spokesman for democracy world-wide.
The United States has promoted democracy and political
pluralism in Eastern and Central Europe, and in the former
Soviet Union where our former adversaries seek advice as
they make the transition from totalitarianism to democracy.
Our efforts in Africa have been extensive as well. We have
encouraged independence in Namibia; presidential elec-
tions in Benin; steps toward a multiparty system in
Ethiopia; elections in Zambia, Gabon, the Ivory Coast, and
the Congo; and movement toward democracy in Angola
and free, democratic, and representative government in
South Africa. Democracy was the ideology on which our
victory in the Cold War was based, and it continues to be
the only system which guarantees individual civil and
human rights.

How We Can Lead In Collective
Engagement In The Near Term

Despite these successes, there are peoples who do not yet
enjoy freedom or who are still in the process of transition
— peoples looking for guidance and who need our help.
Democracies can be fragile and must be nurtured.
Elections by themselves are no panacea. Representative
institutions must be built with persistence and democratic
principles fostered widely so that undemocratic forces can-
not manipulate the process. It is in our national interest to
help the democratic community of nations continue to
grow while ensuring stability. Our global leadership in this
endeavor must adapt, however, in the context of new inter-
national trends: the renewed effectiveness of multinational
organizations, particularly the United Nations and the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe; the
greater diffusion of power that has accompanied the end of
the Cold War; and the increasing necessity to build coali-
tions to advance common interests.

For the United States to lead effectively in the political
arena, there are several steps we must take.

¢ The key to our success has been — and will continue to
be — our partnerships with the industrial and other
major democracies. In concert, we must support stabil-
ity and economic and political reform in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union — our number-
one foreign policy priority today. We should do so
through firm political support for reform movements and
through the extension of broad-based government and
non-government assistance. This includes macro-eco-
nomic support to enhance the prospects for long-term
institutional reform, technical economic assistance, and
humanitarian and medical assistance to promote short-
term stability. More than anything else, our encourage-
ment of private trade and investment will help these
countries integrate themselves into the free market eco-
nomic system. In addition, we are implementing a wide
variety of exchange programs and other initiatives
designed to promote closer political relationships
between our countries. Nothing would more profound-
ly enhance our security than to have our former adver-
saries succeed in establishing stable democratic, free-
market systems. Nothing would so cloud our future
security than to see them fail. After sacrificing so much

 

to contain and defeat Communism, we must act to
assure its replacement by democracy, freedom, and
human rights.

¢ We must also work to support, encourage, and consoli-
date democracy elsewhere around the world, both
multilaterally and bilaterally. Our tools include a vigor-
ous public diplomacy conducted by the USIA, the Voice
of America, and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and
successful assistance programs focused on democratic
institution-building such as the National Endowment for
Democracy and the International Military Education and
Training program. These efforts should continue. We
should strive to bring stable democracy and free markets
to lands that have little knowledge of them, strengthen
democratic institutions where they are fragile and threat-
ened. Where authoritarianism still dominates, we
should continue to explain ourselves and to provide fac-
tual information and hope. Maintaining our own high
standard of democratic practice and the rule of law is
vital to our ability to lead by example.

© We must continue to champion a fair, politically sus-
tainable international refugee and immigration regime
for the post-Cold War era. Our efforts to promote
democracy and free-market prosperity should help
reduce the flow of refugees and emigrants. The United
States should continue to assist governments, regional
organizations, and international institutions such as the
United Nations in providing humanitarian assistance to
refugees and displaced persons and in establishing
processes for free and orderly movement of peoples. At
the same time, we must expect others in the world com-
munity to work to provide economic opportunity for
their peoples.

As we provide American leadership to extend the “zone of
peace” and enhance the forces of integration that are evi-
dent in the new world, we must also provide American
leadership to inhibit the forces of fragmentation that threat-
en order, peace and stability.

 

How We Can Influence The
Future

At the United Nations...

The most desirable and efficient security strategy is to
address the root causes of instability and to ease tensions
before they result in conflict. With the paralyzing divisions
of the Cold War now over, the United Nations has been
given a new lease on life, emerging as a central instrument
for the prevention and resolution of conflicts and the
preservation of peace. But the requirement for U.N. action
has increased dramatically and now includes everything
from election monitoring, preventive diplomacy and tradi-
tional peacekeeping to humanitarian relief, facilitating the
stable transition of previously belligerent states back into
the community of Nations, and monitoring compliance
with Security Council resolutions. The U.N. has undertak-
en fifteen new operations in the last four years alone, from
Angola, El Salvador, the Western Sahara, Cambodia and
Yugoslavia, to lrag/Kuwait, Somalia, Mozambique, and
Afghanistan.

In concert with others, the United States must renew its
efforts to improve the recent effectiveness of the United
Nations. As was demonstrated in the Gulf War and in sub-
sequent crises, we now have the opportunity to make the
United Nations a key instrument of collective security. The
United States should do its part to strengthen U.N. conflict
prevention, peacekeeping and peacemaking capabilities by:

© participating in, supporting and contributing to long
overdue reform of the U.N. system to increase the orga-
nization’s capability to perform these and other impor-
tant roles;

* creating a new Fund for Peace to help pay America’s
share of the greater demands for United Nations peace-
keeping. We should pay all arrearages to the U.N. as
planned and ensure timely payment of future assess-
ments;

* taking an active role in the full spectrum of U.N. peace-
keeping and humanitarian relief planning and support;
and

¢ helping to strengthen international efforts to combat the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by making
the U.N. Security Council a key forum for nonpro-
lifeation activities.

 

 

Regionally ...

While the United States emerged from the Cold War as the
world’s preeminent power, we have neither the desire nor
the ability to be the world’s “policeman.” Regional solu-
tions to regional problems are the most enduring path to
peace. We should support those efforts, helping to facili-
tate the regional process whenever possible. Regional
organizations should be utilized to contribute to building a
broader consensus behind international endeavors. The
international coalition’s victory in the Gulf War created
conditions favorable to the Middle East peace process,
bringing adversaries together to resolve their differences
peacefully. We should continue to be a catalyst, an honest
broker and a full partner in that process.

Each region of the world has its own unique set of political,
economic and military challenges.

¢ In Europe, the North Atlantic Alliance remains central to
our security, and the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) is taking on important
new roles in the resolution of conflict and the promotion
of democracy. We should work to strengthen the
NATO alliance and adapt it to new tasks; help enhance
the CSCE in its new role; and promote dialogue, cooper-
ation, and mutual security for all nations of NATO,
Central and Eastern Europe. We should continue to par-
ticipate in the evolution of a European security identity.

* In the former Soviet Union, we will provide expertise,
including implementation of the Freedom Support Act,
to assist the new states in building representative politi-
cal systems and market economies, and foster coopera-
tive regional and international relations. We will work
with them to promote peaceful solutions to the ethnic
crises on their borders which threaten stability in
Eurasia. We will also work toward the peaceful solution
of ethnic and nationalistic tensions and crises in Eastern
Europe and the Balkans.

© In Asia, our agenda is five-fold. First, the United States
must maintain a strategic framework which reflects its
status as a Pacific power and promotes its engagement
in Asia. The key to the United States’ strategic frame-
work has been, and will continue to be, its alliance with
Japan. Second, we must continue to expand markets
through bilateral, regional, and multilateral arrange-

 

ments. Third, we must carefully watch the emergence
of China onto the world stage and support, contain, or
balance this emergence as necessary to protect U.S.
interests. Fourth, we must continue to play a critical
role in the peaceful unification process on the Korean
peninsula. Finally, we should encourage the normaliza-
tion of Indochina and the expansion and development
of the Association of East Asian Nations.

In Latin America, the Organization of American States
(OAS) was involved in the highly complex effort to bring
an end to the war in Nicaragua and to defend democra-
cy in Peru and Haiti. We should work to enhance the
OAS as an instrument for the promotion and defense of
democracy. But without economic growth, little
progress is possible. The principles underlying the
Enterprise for the Americas Initiative are basic to eco-
nomic development and the achievement of democratic
goals. Both Haiti’s and Cuba’s peaceful return to
democracy remains an unwavering objective.

 

¢ In Africa, the Organization of African Unity, along with
a number of international organizations, is actively
working to address the continent’s needs and problems.
The United States supports these and other efforts such
as the Economic Community of West Africa, foresees
the expansion of their importance, and should provide
appropriate assistance. Our leadership in Operation
RESTORE HOPE is designed to encourage other nations
to contribute to the amelioration of the human condition
there, laying the foundation for continued economic
and political progress.

¢ Inthe Middle East, the U.S.-initiated peace process has
brought together regional and extra-regional govern-
ments in bilateral! and multilateral negotiations aimed at
resolving conflicts, fostering arms control and regional
stability, and promoting economic and technical coop-
eration. We will continue to support these efforts as
well as those of the Gulf Cooperation Council to
enhance stability in that vital area.

 

 

 

IV. Economic Progress At Home And
Opportunities Abroad ...
Our Economic Agenda

National prosperity and national security are mutualiy-sup-
portive goals. Indeed, in the most tangible ways — eco-
nomic prosperity and freedom from foreign dangers — all
Americans have gained enormously from the success of
our global leadership. Our commitment to an open world
trading system, especially, has helped America, a trading
nation since its birth, to grow and prosper. And today we
depend on the global economy more than at anytime in
our history — a dependence that will certainly increase in
the future.

What We Have Achieved

Maintaining a strong domestic economy and helping our
friends and allies grow and prosper have been core ele-
ments in our national security strategy since 1945. U.S.
policies which aided the economic rebirth of Europe and
Japan after World War II enabled them to play major roles
in containing the spread of Communism. Indeed, one of
the clearest lessons of the collapse of Communism is that
without an economic system that allows for personal free-
dom and initiative, there can be no lasting political or mili-
tary strength.

America’s postwar policies have provided leadership so
that the industrial democracies have chosen to work
together, rather than pursue the destructive economic
nationalism of the inter-war period. The progressive reduc-
tion of trade barriers has raised living standards significant-
ly. Ideas, capital, goods and services now move around
the world with increasing speed, expanding economic
opportunity. Efforts to help developing nations are now
well established in the international financial institutions
and national policies of developed countries. Major
progress in democracy, economic reform and develop-

 

ment, human rights and security in the Western
Hemisphere has been achieved through the new coopera-
tion embodied in our Enterprise for the Americas Initiative.
New governments committed to democratic ideals and
market-based economics have now replaced our former
Communist adversaries in Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union.

Our Economic Challenge

A top national security priority today must be to strengthen
economic performance at home and economic leadership
abroad. Effective participation in the global economy will
be a key factor in our future prosperity and security. In
1991, U.S. foreign trade exceeded $1.2 trillion, twenty-one
percent of our gross national product. The United States is
the world’s largest exporter of goods and services, with
1991 sales totaling $591 billion. Over seven and one-half
million jobs are linked directly to our exports.

The distinction between domestic economic policy and
international economic policy is disappearing. While suc-
cessful international businesses already operate largely on
such a basis, governments have been slow to respond to
this reality. United States’ economic strategy must be glob-
al rather than national. It must include increased attention
to the range of new issues on our agenda: environmental
degradation, population pressures in developing countries,
migration and refugees, disease and other health problems.

 

What We Need To Do

America’s longer term economic position in the world will
be determined by how well we succeed in:

strengthening economic competitiveness through sound
monetary and fiscal policies, greater savings and invest-
ment;

¢ improving our infrastructure and our education system;
* ensuring our lead in the crucial technologies of a new era;

* convincing others that free trade offers greater prosperity
than managed trade or protected markets;

* supporting market economies in all regions of the world;
and

enhancing the effectiveness of the institutions,national
and international, needed to sustain a global market
economy.

This is a long-term mission which will require the active
participation of all Americans. Only a consistent growth
strategy for the next ten to fifteen years can make signifi-
cant progress in reforming our economy and sustaining
U.S. economic leadership in the world.

At home, our long-term growth strategy must include:

* sustained measures to bring federal spending more into
line with available resources and to lower the federal
deficit significantly;

* prudent monetary policy to support economic growth
while ensuring continued low inflation and stable prices;

* greater national savings to reduce the cost of capital for
productive sectors of the economy;

© increased investment, particularly in research and devel-
opment;

reducing the burden of taxation, regulation, and litiga-
tion on our economy;

© raising educational performance, particularly pre-school
through high school, and implementing reforms to
enhance parental control and choice;

10

 

* greater efficiency in the use of energy, particularly oil,
through market mechanisms, not regulation;

* improved infrastructure, particularly in transportation
and communication; and

* new approaches to dealing with societal ills which sap
our economic strength.

Updating Our International Economic
Policy

As we revitalize the domestic economy, we must also
rethink our foreign economic policy. Most important, we
need to recognize that only through joint action with our
economic partners will we be able to achieve our interna-
tional economic objectives. Thanks to our economic
strength and genuine commitment to an open international
economic system, we can play a unique guiding role. But
increasingly, the United States is viewed as first among
equals, not dominant, in international economic fora. We
cannot dictate to others, but we can encourage them to
cooperate.

Our priorities for the next decade should include action to:

* Improve economic policies and performance among the
major industrial countries to promote sustained global
economic growth. Macroeconomic policy coordination,
particularly among the G-7, needs to be strengthened.

¢ Continue promoting global and regional trade liberaliza-
tion. Globally, we need to bring the Uruguay Round to
a successful conclusion and lay the groundwork in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) for fur-
ther multilateral trade liberalization and more effective
adjudication of trade disputes. Regionally, now that we
have concluded the North American Free Trade
Agreement, we should press ahead with the Enterprise
for the Americas Initiative, building the foundation for
free trade agreements with other Latin American coun-
tries. We should also explore the possibility of arrange-
ments leading to free trade agreements with countries in
other regions, such as Asia and Europe, where we have
important interests.

¢ Ensure that relations with the European Community
remain on a sound footing through regular high-level
political and economic consultations. Building on more

 

than a decade of trade negotiations, we need an
improved understanding with Japan on resolving trade
differences and increasing market access for foreign
goods. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
should be used to strengthen trade relations and pro-
mote further liberalization in Asia.

¢ Fundamentally rethink national and international strate-
gies to assist development in poorer countries. With a
few exceptions, the results of foreign aid have not been
commensurate with the resources expended.
Significantly greater emphasis must be place on market-
oriented structural reforms.

© Continue the cooperative effort with our allies and the
international financial institutions to support the success-
ful transformation of Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union to market-based economies integrated into
the global market place. In addition to providing ade-
quate financial aid and technical assistance, we need to
ensure that these countries have access to markets
abroad to encourage trade and private-sector growth.

¢ Strengthen the international financial and economic
institutions — the World Bank, the IMF, the OECD, the
GATT and the regional development banks — so they
can effectively meet the challenges posed by a dramati-
cally evolving world economy. International financial
institutions must give greater emphasis to supporting the
private sector and developing sound market-based poli-
cies.

¢ Likewise, reassess and realign as necessary the econom-
ic mandate of various United Nations bodies. Particular
attention should be given to the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), the U.N. Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO), the U.N. Committee on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD), the Economic and Social
Council (ECOSOC), and the five regional U.N. econom-
ic commissions.

Building Government Institutions to
Serve the Future

We must complete the process of streamlining and restruc-
turing U.S. government institutions. Most of our institu-
tions dealing with economic issues either date from before
1940 or were created during the Cold War. Coordination
within the government can be improved; duplication of

 

activities should be eliminated. We need to re-examine
the entire government apparatus — agency structure, per-
sonnel and practices — to ensure the most efficient policy-
making under new conditions.

We need also emphasize the importance of an active U.S.
international role. Many of our overseas diplomatic activi-
ties directly support U.S. jobs and create opportunities for
business to expand. We should restructure the various
agencies of the U.S. government engaged in export promo-
tion to ensure a coherent, coordinated approach. In re-
evaluating our approaches to trade promotion, we should
focus on key areas of trade competitiveness and work with
the private sector to tailor programs to meet specific needs.

Bilateral Development Assistance

Just as the United States saw that it was in its national inter-
est to help Europe and Japan overcome the devastation of
World War II, so too is it in our interest to help former
Communist countries overcome the ravages of central
planning and excessive state control. But the Executive
and Congress must join these countries in casting aside old
thinking, especially in deciding how to use and when to
provide foreign assistance. U.S. foreign assistance pro-
grams and management both must be thoroughly reorient-
ed in support of our economic policy. Numerous commis-
sions and experts have advocated fundamental reform of
our foreign assistance structure and priorities. The end of
the Cold War provides an excellent opportunity for under-
taking needed reform.

Our foreign aid program should focus to the maximum
extent on sound economic policies in recipient countries
and the promotion of the private sector. The goal of for-
eign assistance should be to reduce dependency, not pro-
long it. The most effective use of foreign aid occurs when
recipient countries follow free market principles and build
pluralistic democratic institutions. Adherence to such prin-
ciples stimulates international trade and investment, which
are vastly more important than the relatively small flows of
official international assistance.

The Environment

Environmental degradation is one of the most pressing
global problems. Deforestation, climate change, air and
water pollution, and depletion of water supplies have far-
reaching effects on the capacity of countries to sustain eco-

11

 

nomic growth and ensure a healthy environment for their
citizens. Environmental problems transcend national
boundaries. Air and water pollution in one country can
affect far distant countries as well as those nearby. Some
problems, such as ozone depletion and climate change,
can have a global impact. In many developing countries,
environmental degradation is already causing serious
health problems and limiting economic development.

Addressing these environmental issues requires a global
effort. The United States has established some of the
strictest environmental standards in the world, and we need
to live up to them. However, we are not immune to the
effects of environmental degradation elsewhere. The
United States is already playing an active role in supporting
multinational environmental programs, population control
initiatives, and research on global problems. We will con-
tinue to advance international cooperation on environmen-
tal issues and support this effort with adequate funding. We
especially need to ensure that environmental concerns are

12

 

integrated fully into our overall economic and trade poli-
cies. Economic growth and environmental protection can
be made complementary objectives to be pursued together.

Space

We need to continue to use the unique environment of
space to investigate new materials and medicines, develop
new sources of energy, and find solutions to environmental
problems on earth. This will require an invigorated and
better integrated defense and commercial space effort. We
must encourage multinational efforts as well. Significant
success has been achieved in conjunction with the
European Space Agency, the former Soviet Union, and
other nations supporting Space Station Freedom, a mission
focused on improving life on earth. In addition, we should
promote policies which encourage private investment in
space. This will help create jobs, boost the economy and
strengthen our science, engineering, and industrial base.

 

 

V. Security Through Strength: Legacy and
Mandate... Our Defense Agenda

Our strategy has shifted from a focus on a global threat to
one on regional challenges and opportunities, from con-
tainment to a new regional defense strategy. The demise of
the global threat posed by Soviet Communism leaves
America and its allies with an unprecedented opportunity
to preserve with greater ease a security environment within
which our democratic ideals can prosper. Where once a
European-wide war, potentially leading to nuclear
exchange, was theoretically only weeks and yards away,
today such a threat has receded and would take years to
rekindle. With the end of the Cold War, there are no sig-
nificant hostile alliances. We have a substantial lead in
critical areas of warfare. The combination of these trends
has given our Nation and our alliances great depth for our
strategic position.

Indeed these alliances, built during our struggle of contain-
ment, are one of the great sources of our strength in this
new era. They represent a community of democratic
nations bound together by a web of political, economic,
and security ties and offer a framework for security not
through competitive rivalries in arms, but through coopera-
tive approaches and collective security institutions. Yet,
even as we hope to rely increasingly on collective
approaches to solve international problems, we recognize
that a collective response will not always be timely, and, in
the absence of American leadership, may not be feasible.

Simply put, we should strive to shape an uncertain future to
preserve strategic depth — won at great sacrifice — and to
enhance it in ways that would help preclude hostile non-
democratic powers from dominating regions critical to our
interests. During the global struggle of the Cold War,
developments in even remote areas could affect the United
States’ relative position in the world, and therefore often
required a U.S. response. Today, the United States remains
a nation with global interests, but we must reexamine
whether and how particular challenges threaten our inter-
ests. A clear understanding of our interests and responsibil-

 

ities along with the growing strength of our friends and
allies will allow us to be more selective in determining
whether U.S. forces must be committed.

Guided by this new regional defense strategy, we are
reducing our forces significantly — by almost a quarter —
to their lowest level in terms of manpower since before the
Korean war. Yet, even as we reduce the size of our forces,
we must not destroy their quality or their technological
superiority. Along with alliances, high-quality personnel
and technological superiority represent capabilities that
would take decades to restore if foolishly lost in this time of
reductions.

While we no longer face the possibility of a Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact attack on Europe, regional instabilities contin-
ue to threaten our interests and our security. The world
remains unpredictable and over-armed, and nations have
not eliminated the age-old temptation to use force or intim-
idation to achieve their ends. The end of the Cold War has
coincided with a virtual explosion of long-dormant ethnic
and aggressive nationalistic tensions around the world,
many of which have degenerated into international crises.
Proliferation, terrorism, and the international drug trade still
threaten stability.

The United States must continue to provide the leadership
necessary to encourage and sustain cooperation among our
allies, friends, and new partners in meeting the challenges
that we will inevitably encounter in the future. We must
continue to stay engaged, thereby preventing the emer-
gence either of a new global threat or a vacuum in a region
critical to our interests. Nations will depend on America’s
strength, readiness and leadership in the years to come as
much as they did during the Cold War and the Gulf crisis.
Neither for their sake nor for our own can we afford any-
thing less than the most capable, best equipped, and best
led military in the world.

What We Have Achieved

During the Cold War, our refusal to be intimidated by
expansionist Soviet policies or massive military build-up,
our willingness to counter that build-up, and our deploy-
ment of forces overseas all helped provide a shield against
Soviet aggression. That allowed democracy to develop
and flourish around the world. The Cold War is over —
not because America passively waited, but because we led
the way. We led by maintaining our own highly-capable
military and through continued engagement in both Europe
and Asia. On the whole, our policies deterred conflict and
kept pressure on the Soviet Union which ultimately col-
lapsed from within. We helped our democratic allies in
Europe and Asia not only to counter the Communist threat,
but also to become strong enough politically and economi-
cally to help bear the burden of the common defense.
Finally, the transformation of the Soviet Union has enabled
us to achieve unprecedented new reductions in the strate-
gic nuclear arsenals of both sides and a series of agree-
ments on conventional and chemical weapons.

Most recently, our commitment and leadership in the Gulf
War sustained the confidence and respect of the world.
More than half a million men and women of our armed
forces helped carry out an historic campaign to liberate
Kuwait and stop Saddam Hussein from dominating the
region and essentially controlling global energy resources.
The quality, training, technological sophistication, and
logistics expertise of our Armed Forces, together with
superb military planning and leadership, produced a swift
victory.

The United States has assisted many nations around the
globe in building their own self-defense capabilities, thus
countering the sense of vulnerability that tends to spur arms
races and weapons proliferation. We have also assisted in
humanitarian efforts following natural disasters, in peace-
keeping operations, in infrastructure development, and
through military-to-military programs, in helping numerous
countries make the transition to democratic systems.

Beginning in 1990, the United States embarked on a
wholesale reconfiguring of our armed forces for the post-
Cold War era, consistent with a new vision of the strategic
environment. We have struck an effective balance by
downsizing and restructuring significantly and quickly
without making precipitous cuts which could tempt aggres-
sors or cause allies to doubt our resolve and capabilities.

How We Can Lead In Collective
Engagement In The Near Term

The Defense Program

The fundamental elements of our national defense strategy
— strategic deterrence and defense; forward presence; cri-
sis response; and reconstitution — are clearly defined and
will remain valid for the foreseeable future.

* Strategic Deterrence and Defense. Deterring nuclear
attack remains our top priority. We must still possess
modern strategic nuclear forces and a reliable warning
system. We must develop a system for global protection
against limited ballistic-missile attack. We must main-
tain responsive, highly trained, technologically sophisti-
cated, and broadly capable conventional and uncon-
ventional forces. We must maintain and improve space
systems integral to strategic and tactical operations
worldwide.

¢ Forward Presence. While reducing our forward-
deployed forces, we are redefining our presence abroad
with combined exercises, new access and storage agree-
ments, security and humanitarian assistance, port visits,
military-to-military contacts, and periodic and rotational
deployments. Our forward presence forces and opera-
tions lend credibility to our alliances and ensure the per-
ception that a collective response awaits any threat to
our interests or to those of our allies.

* Crisis Response. We must maintain an adequate capa-
bility to project power in response to crises should our
efforts to deter conflict fail. The very existence of a
robust crisis response capability strengthens deterrence.
Our force structure must be flexible enough to ensure
we can fulfill both traditional and non-traditional
requirements. In addition, the capability to generate
decisive combat power, if and when needed, strength-
ens our ability to terminate a given conflict swiftly on
terms favorable to us and with minimum loss of life.
The precise nature of our response to a crisis will, of
course, depend on the interests at stake, our commit-
ments to the nations involved, the level and sophistica-
tion of the threat, and on the capabilities of U.S. and
allied forces.

 

* Reconstitution. As we reduce the size of our military
forces in response to the demise of the global threat, we
must ensure that we continue to deter potential adver-
saries from militarizing and, if deterrence fails, retain the
capability to recreate a global warfighting capability.
This “reconstitution” capability involves forming, train-
ing, and fielding new fighting units from cadres; mobi-
lizing previously trained or new manpower; and activat-
ing the industrial base on a large scale. Reconstitution
also involves maintaining technology, doctrine, training,
experienced military personnel, and innovation neces-
sary to retain the competitive edge in decisive areas of
potential military competition.

We must capitalize on our traditional strengths, learn from
our experience in DESERT STORM, and _plan for future
contingencies in which our challengers will have learned
some of the same lessons. We must maintain land, mar-
itime, and aerospace as well as technological superiority.
We must improve our ability to conduct coalition opera-
tions, project power by expanding our air and sealift capa-
bilities as well as by enhancing the inter-theater strategic
agility of our forces. We must look for new and innovative
ways for our armed forces to make a long-term contribu-
tion to peace and stability through assisting the militaries of
Eastern and Central Europe, the former Soviet Union, and
elsewhere around the globe in the transition to democracy.
The new George C. Marshall European Center for Security
Studies is an excellent example of such an initiative.

In the final analysis, our armed forces must be prepared to
respond rapidly, to deter, and, if necessary, to fight and win
unilaterally or as part of a coalition.

The Defense Industrial Base

The defense industrial base is a critical element of our
national security. It is a complicated network of contract-
ing, subcontracting, and vendor firms, as well as Defense
Department maintenance depots. We rely upon the indus-
trial base for the cost efficient manufacture, maintenance
and modernization of technologically superior weapon sys-
tems and munitions over the long term in peacetime and
for the timely delivery of the goods and services required
by our armed forces in times of crisis or conflict.

In peacetime, the industrial base must provide an advanced
research and development capability, ready access to civil-
ian technology, and a continuous design and prototyping
capability. Increased focus must be placed on innovative

 

manufacturing techniques that provide the capability to
incorporate rapidly and cost effectively the most advanced
technological improvements into our armed forces.

In conflict, the industrial base must be capable of surging
production of essential warfighting items prior to and dur-
ing a contingency operation. In addition, the industrial
base must have the capacity to restore, in a reasonable
period, the war reserve stockpiles of items that were con-
sumed. Finally, the industrial base must be able to recon-
stitute forces in order to respond to the reemergence of a
global threat.

As the national defense budget declines over the near- to
mid-term, we must ensure that the industrial base providers
of unique, critical peacetime, conflict and reconstitution-
related capabilities are available when needed. In order to
do this, we need to examine such things as:

¢ Recent and projected trends in our ability to surge mili-
tary production in crises or wartime.

© Unique critical industrial capabilities affected by
changes in current and projected defense acquisition
programs.

¢ Allied potential to provide these criticalcapabilities, and
how much we should rely on outside sources.

* Technologies that are likely to emerge which could off-
set the loss of critical-component suppliers for current
and near-to mid-term weapon systems and platforms.

© Other major factors which could ensure a viable defen-
seindustrial base capable of supporting modernization
or reconstitution of forces over the long-term.

Important initiatives are already underway. National
Technology initiatives will provide opportunities to rely
more heavily upon new technological advances with sig-
nificant commercial applications. The Defense Conversion
Commission is another example. It will provide better
understanding of the opportunities for industries to diversify
and to convert from defense production while preserving
critical defense-related skills and to commercialize new
technology advances. We must, however, remain commit-
ted to the fundamental principle that a robust free market,
and not government intervention and regulation, is the key
to an effective defense industrial base.

15

 

 

Nonproliferation

In the post-Cold War era, one of our most threatening
national security challenges is the spread of weapons of
mass destruction and the means to deliver them. As the
threat of nuclear confrontation with the former Soviet
Union recedes, the danger that a nuclear, chemical, or bio-
logical weapon will be launched from some other quarter
by an aggressor is growing. Covert procurement networks
continue their energetic global efforts to acquire the means
to build these weapons. While the disintegration of the
Soviet bloc has led to relaxation of the forty-year-old East-
West controls of the allied Coordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), dual-use technolo-
gies with military applications are becoming increasingly
available throughout world markets. Inevitably, an increas-
ing number of supplier nations will become able to con-
tribute to the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons
of mass destruction.

U.S. nonproliferation policy is guided by four principles:

© Build on existing global norms against proliferation and,
where possible, strengthen and broaden them.

¢ Focus special efforts on those areas where the dangers
of proliferation remain acute, notably the Middle East,
Southwest Asia, South Asia, and the Korean Peninsula.

© Seek the broadest possible multilateral support, while
reserving the capability for unilateral action.

¢ Address the underlying security concerns that motivate
the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction, relying
on the entire range of political, diplomatic, economic,
intelligence, military, security assistance, and other
available tools.

These principles have been reflected in a number of
actions within the past year. At U.S. urging, multilateral
export control regimes — the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR) and the Australia Group (which covers
chemical and biological technologies) — updated and
expanded their control lists. Completion of negotiations on
the Chemical Weapons Convention brought the world
nearer to a verifiable global ban on chemical weapons.
The 27 nations of the Nuclear Suppliers Group reconvened
for the first time in a dozen years and in 1992 reached

16

 

agreement to control 65 categories of dual-use equipment.
At U.S. initiative, COCOM created a Cooperative Forum to
enlist the cooperation of the newly independent states of
the former Soviet Union and other East European states in
controlling the export of sensitive technology. Japan and
the United States have agreed to strengthen their existing
understandings on supercomputer export controls. The
United Nations Special Commission and the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have continued their efforts
to dismantle Saddam Hussein’s nonconventional weapons
programs. North Korea at last accepted IAEA inspections
in accordance with its international obligations, although
full compliance is not yet assured.

In addition, the United States encouraged broader partici-
pation in nonproliferation regimes. The Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) roster has grown to over 150 states including
China, France, and South Africa. The Treaty of Tlatelolco
may soon bring a nuclear weapon-free zone into force
throughout Latin America. The U.S. Enhanced Proliferation
Control Initiative has strengthened our own regulatory bar-
riers against missile, chemical, and biological weapons
technology proliferation, including proscriptions against
U.S. citizens contributing to proliferation. Through the
Middle East Arms Control Initiative, we will continue to
pursue the post-Gulf War opportunities for arms restraint.
Under the June 1992 nonproliferation initiative, we will
accelerate and intensify our nonproliferation efforts. In
addition, the United States will not produce plutonium or
highly-enriched uranium for nuclear explosive purposes —
a step intended to encourage countries in regions of ten-
sion such as the Middle East and South Asia to take similar
actions.

Though many of our efforts will continue through govern-
mental channels — including our Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency refocused to support nonproliferation
in addition to its tradition agenda — the private sector can
and must play an active role. The International Science
and Technology Center in Moscow and the Science
Technology Center in Kiev should provide promising civil-
ian opportunities for former weapon designers and engi-
neers. More creative approaches to this problem will be
required in the years ahead.

 

Arms Control

For most of the Cold War era, arms control efforts were
aimed primarily at dampening the effects of superpower
competition. Though noteworthy, the successes registered
were limited: for example, banning above-ground nuclear
tests; prohibiting biological weapons; placing ceilings on
permitted growth in strategic nuclear forces.

In the last few years, with the extraordinary changes in the
international security environment, that picture has
changed dramatically. Over a very short time, we have
achieved remarkable success in reducing nuclear and con-
ventional arsenals, in the effort to ban chemical weapons,
in establishing an extensive network of confidence-building
measures and communications facilities among former
adversaries.

Instead of merely dampening competition, arms control
now plays a major role in creating the framework for coop-
eration. In keeping with that change, the process of arms
control has also altered dramatically. In some areas, partic-
ularly with the independent states of the former Soviet
Union, we can now afford to take unilateral steps, often
based on anticipated reciprocity. In others, we continue to
require formal agreements, but those can be arrived at far
more quickly than before.

Before July 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union
had never agreed to reduce their strategic nuclear forces.
Now the combination of the July 1991 START Treaty, the
President's nuclear initiatives of September 1991 and
January 1992, and the June 1992 Bush-Yeltsin agreement
on further strategic arms reductions will lower the number
of our strategic nuclear forces to less than one-third their
1990 level. Moreover, each side will eliminate all of its
multiple-warhead ICBMs, leaving strategic nuclear forces
that are true deterrent forces.

The 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe
(CFE) significantly reduces conventional military equipment
in Europe. CFE and the Helsinki Summit Agreement plac-
ing politically binding limits on military manpower in
Europe, establish comprehensive and stable levels of con-
ventional military forces on a continent that for centuries
was a major focus of conflict. The Open Skies Treaty will
help in this regard. We are also working closely with our
partners in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe (CSCE) to develop greater stability and openness in
military activities on the continent.

 

A major unfinished itern on the arms control agenda, to
which the United States attaches the highest priority, is the
banning of chemical weapons. The best hope of achieving
the worldwide elimination of chemical weapons and of
stemming proliferation at the same time is to bring into
force the Chemical Weapons Convention. The United
States will be an original signatory to the Convention. To
spur others to commit themselves to the completion and
implementation of the Convention and to accelerate the
negotiations, the United States has formally forsworn the
use of chemical weapons for any purposes, including retal-
iation, against any state, effective when the Convention
enters into force. In addition, we are unconditionally com-
mitted to the complete destruction of all U.S. chemical
weapons stocks within ten years of its entry into force. We
did not wait for entry into force of the Convention and
have already begun the destruction of our chemical
weapons. The United States has also concluded agree-
ments with Russia concerning the destruction of chemical
weapons, along with agreements on the safety, security,
and dismantlement of nuclear warheads, as part of our
overall efforts to aid the former Soviet Union in defense
conversion.

Ballistic-Missile Defenses

Ballistic-missile defense remains a critical element of our
strategic posture, but given the current strategic conditions,
we have shifted our focus. The United States is now com-
mitted to the development of a system to provide Global
Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS). The receding
Soviet threat and the continued proliferation of ballistic-
missile capabilities encouraged us to redirect our SDI pro-
gram to meet an enduring requirement to protect our terri-
tory, our allies, and our forces abroad from accidental,
unauthorized or rogue-nation ballistic-missile attacks.

As the Patriot demonstrated during the Gulf War, ballistic
missile defenses are crucial to protect our troops and allies
against madmen or rogue nations. But we can and must
do better than Patriot to meet the growing threat from pro-
liferation. Ballistic-missile defenses will reinforce our other
security and regional policies and can be a force for stabili-
ty in troubled regions, removing the need for hair-trigger
responses to aggression, and possibly underwriting ballis-
tic-missile arms control measures.

17

 

At the June 1992 Summit, Presidents Bush and Yeltsin
agreed to work together, with allies and other interested
states, in developing a concept for a Global Protection
System (GPS) against limited ballistic missile attack. Since
then, we have discussed GPS in detail with friends, NATO
allies, and with high-level representatives of Russia and
other former Soviet republics. We will continue our unilat-
eral, bilateral and multilateral efforts in an effort to develop
a mutually agreed GPS. This commitment to cooperation
on a Global Protection System is a landmark in U.S.-
Russian relations and will ensure that missile defenses can
be deployed in a stabilizing manner for the benefit of the
community of nations.

Intelligence

Our intelligence services continue to provide insights not
available from diplomatic exchanges or open sources —
insights that can give us a critical advantage in responding
to dangers or opportunities. Accurate and timely informa-
tion about conditions, motives, and actions of foreign pow-
ers is all the more essential in a radically changed world.
Clearly the main topics of interest have changed from a
few short years ago, but there is no diminution in the value
of accurate, timely information for policy formulation and
implementation.

Additionally, there is no lessening of the value of accurate,
timely information in support of military planning and
operations, particularly as U.S. force structure levels are
drawn down. We must know the basis for other nations’
policies and actions, their motives and their limits. U.S.
intelligence assets, technical and human, must remain
strong and responsive. They must remain flexible and
adaptable to changing policy objectives and priorities.

In recognition of a radically changed world, every effort is
being made to organize our intelligence institutions more
effectively and to enhance sharing and support between
their civil and military components. Intelligence priorities
have changed significantly. Some old intelligence targets
such as state-sponsored terrorism remain, but new chal-
lenges — the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
narcotics trafficking and sanctions monitoring — demand
concentrated collection.

To the extent prudent, U.S. intelligence today is also being

used in dramatically new ways, such as assisting interna-
tional organizations like the United Nations when called

18

 

upon in support of crucial peacekeeping, humanitarian
assistance and arms control efforts. We will share informa-
tion and assets that strengthen peaceful relationships and
aid in building confidence. Finally, despite significant and
unprecedented progress in our intelligence exchange with
friendly and formerly hostile governments abroad, the hos-
tile intelligence threat still exists and continued priority
attention must be given to counterintelligence.

Terrorism

Despite having secured the release of all American
hostages in Lebanon and a welcome decline in major ter-
rorist events, terrorism remains a potential threat to our
national security — a threat we will oppose by all legal
means available. To accede to terrorist demands only
places more American citizens at risk. But terrorism is not
merely the seizing of hostages. We will pay no ransoms
nor agree to other conditions that could serve to encourage
additional terrorism. This no-concessions policy is the
most effective way of protecting the greatest number of
people and ensuring their safety. At the same time, every
available resource will be used to gain the safe return of
American citizens who are taken hostage by terrorists.
Enhanced security and counterterrorism measures have
helped thwart other terrorist acts such as arson, bombings,
and armed assaults.

States that practice or actively support terrorism will suffer
international isolation and economic repercussions. The
United States will reserve the right to act unilaterally, and
will continue to work cooperatively with other nations to
prevent and respond to terrorist acts. The number of
nations with which we have assurances of cooperation
continues to grow.

Combatting Illegal Drugs

The flow of illicit narcotics into the United States under-
mines our national security in many ways. It harms our
society and degrades our economy, our competitiveness,
and our international leadership as a champion of the rule
of law. Progress has been made in terms of record
seizures, substantial disruption of trafficking routes,
improved international cooperation and the passage of leg-
islation to help stimulate legitimate economic activity as an
alternative to the drug trade. But more is required.

 

 

 

To choke off supply, our principal strategic goal is to iden-
tify, disrupt, dismantle, and ultimately destroy the. traffick-
ing organizations that produce or smuggle illicit drugs for
the U.S. market. The U.S. will continue to mobilize the
international community to combat drug trafficking through
multilateral conventions, bilateral task forces, domestic and
international legal reforms, information programs, and
when needed, new institutions. We have also focused on
strengthening enforcement and interdiction efforts in specif-
ic regions. For example, our Andean, Caribbean, Central
American and Mexican initiatives and programs in other
regions are aimed at potential sources and transit countries.

On the demand side, our National Drug Control Strategy
unites the entire Federal effort and joins state, local and pri-
vate sector efforts into a more effective national partner-
ship. We are now committing unprecedented resources for
education, prevention, treatment, and law enforcement.
Yet, no matter how much money the government commits,
no matter how widespread the implementation programs,
government alone cannot solve the problem of illicit drugs.
We will do all we can, but in the end, it is our families,
neighborhoods, and communities that must nurture critical
values like self-discipline, personal responsibility, and ser-
vice to others.

How We Can Influence The
Future

As we look toward the future in the defense arena, we see
an agenda of new issues and opportunities.

¢ The restructuring and reshaping of the entire
Department of Defense must continue, along with the
development of new strategies and doctrines. In addi-
tion, we must continue to exploit technological opportu-
nities, taking full advantage of the military-technical rev-
olution in weapons, electronics, and organization. We
need advanced sensor and other surveillance and recon-
naissance systems, communications, as well as precision
lethal and non-lethal weapons, and we need to integrate
them more effectively. In peacetime, they will be a
deterrent. In wartime, they will be essential to survival
and success on the battlefield. We need to continue to
restructure our defense technology and industrial base to
shift resources to long-term military potential and recon-
stitution, recognizing the need to field modernized
equipment and to develop operational concepts to
employ new technology effectively.

 

© The United States should significantly increase its
efforts to improve regional and United Nations conflict
prevention efforts, humanitarian assistance, and peace-
keeping capabilities. This would contribute to the early
attenuation of conflict, rather than allowing it to expand
into a serious national threat. Together with our allies
and friends, the United States must develop multination-
al capabilities necessary for enforcing peace, and
enhance our capability to contribute to monitoring, veri-
fication and reconnaissance, as well as peace rebuilding
after conflict. These will demand innovative thinking
and creative leadership.

¢ The United States must continue to play an active role
in the evolution of the European security architecture,
seeking to maintain peace and security at the lowest
necessary level of forces. We must work to strengthen
the viability of NATO, and actively participate in the
development of a credible peacekeeping capability. We
must actively seek the contributions of the members of
the North Atlantic Cooperation Council in these endeav-
ors, and assist them in their transition to democratic sys-
tems.

¢ In Asia, we should strengthen the U.S.-Japan relation-
ship which remains key to regional stability. We must
nurture existing defense relationships, work to expand
access to facilities throughout the region, and encourage
security dialogue and cooperation. We will support
regional stability by maintaining military forces in the
region and through such fora as the ASEAN post-minis-
terial conference; encourage appropriate confidence
building measures; support North and South Korean
bilateral treaties and normalization of relations; continue
to advocate positive change in China; and, consistent
with our top priority of the fullest possible accounting
for our POWs and MIAs, improved relations with
Vietnam.

© In the former Soviet Union, we will continue to encour-
age and support positive, centralized control of nuclear
weapons, press for rapid arms control treaty implemen-
tation and help reduce their nuclear arsenals. We will
continue to press for a full accounting of former Soviet
biological warfare programs. We seek to establish new
relationships with Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, all
of which have agreed to adhere to the NPT as non-
nuclear states. We will help promote effective civilian
control over the military, and assist the military forces of
the former Soviet republics in assuming their legitimate
role in civil society.

19

 

¢ Inthe Middle East and South Asia, we will maintain
forces deployed in the region, expand our bilateral
defense arrangements, preposition materiel and equip-
ment, and conduct joint and combined exercises to
defend the sovereignty, independence and territorial
integrity of our partners in the region. We will continue
to work to assure access to oil, deter recourse to war,
terrorism and subversion, and enforce U.N. Security
Council resolutions.

¢ In Latin America, we will advocate multinational
responses to aggression, seek to strengthen civilian
authority over the military, encourage wider participa-
tion in U.N. peacekeeping operations, promote regional
efforts to implement the arms contro! agenda adopted
by the OAS, and continue to undertake major counter-
drug, counter-terrorism and nation assistance missions
in the region.

¢ In Africa, we will continue to participate in United
Nations peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance
operations. We will promote the peaceful settlement of
disputes and the rule of law, support friends and allies to
improve their self-defense capabilities in order to deter
and defend against regional aggressors, and continue to
maintain and improve our crisis response capabilities.

20

 

© The United States will continue its worldwide efforts to
constrain the proliferation of weapons of mass destruc-
tion. To reduce the danger of the spread of militarily-
useful technologies, weapons of mass destruction, and
the missiles to deliver them from the former Soviet
Union, the United States is working closely with the
new independent states. We will continue to assist their
authorities to implement al! relevant international agree-
ments, and help develop effective internal accounting of
dangerous materials and equipment and methods for
protecting them from theft or diversion. The United
States will also help establish and implement effective
export controls, and assist in the safe and secure dis-
mantling of their nuclear warheads. We will also help
create opportunities for weapons scientists and engi-
neers to redirect their talents to peaceful endeavors.

¢ Finally, it is time to refashion our security assistance
budget, and review how we fund peacekeeping and
explore adequate American financial support for U.N.
peacekeeping and humanitarian activities. We need to
increase funding for military and defense contact pro-
grams and other activities designed to facilitate the suc-
cessful transition of foreign militaries to democratic sys-
tems, as well as ensuring their ability to defend them-
selves against aggression.

 

 

VI. The World As It Can Be...
If We Lead And Attempt To Shape
It As Only America Can

As we approach the 21st Century, the fundamental values
that have guided this Nation for over two centuries have
not changed. Our basic national interests and objectives
and the requirement for American leadership are still the
same. But our strategy has changed to position us better to
lead in a world which has changed as well.

While we no longer confront a single, defining threat, the
challenges that face America today, and that will confront
us in the future, are more complex than ever before. But
just as these challenges are broad, so too are the opportuni-
ties for America. No other nation has the same combina-
tion of moral, cultural, political, economic, and military
credibility. No other has won such confidence, respect,
and trust. No other has the same potential and indeed
responsibility for world leadership.

America has always stood for much more than the sum of
its economic wants and needs. We do care about the
world around us; each successive generation of Americans
has written its own chapter of contributions to the annals of
history. We have inspired many because of what we have
achieved and because of what we represent. We live in a

 

country resplendent in freedom, where people of all reli-
gions, races, creeds, and colors can hope to live in peace
and harmony; where success and achievement are deter-
mined by one’s initiative, ingenuity, and imagination;
where there is an unbounded belief in human dignity and
faith in human potential; where there is always hope for a
better tomorrow. We must continue to share our hopes
and dreams with the world.

We have a vision for the future. We seek a world of coop-
eration and progress, not confrontation; a world no longer
divided, but a community of independent and interdepen-
dent nations joined together by shared values; a world in
which the United States role is defined by what we stand
for — freedom, human rights, economic prosperity, the
tule of law, peace — rather than what we stand against.
To succeed, our strategy will have to be more than words
on a piece of paper. It will take faith, courage, hard work,
and inspiration. It will also take dialogue and debate, for
that too is what democracy is‘all about. It will take the
very best we have to offer — as individuals, as institutions,
as a Nation. Let us work together to lead the world toward
the 21st Century, the Age of Democratic Peace. There is
no more important goal to which we could aspire.

Preface ar

Protecting our nation’s security — our people, our territory
and our way of life — is my Administration’s foremost
mission and constitutional duty. The end of the Cold War
fundamentally changed America’s security imperatives.
The central security challenge of the past half century —
the threat of communist expansion — is gone. The dangers
we face today are more diverse. Ethnic conflict is
spreading and rogue states pose a serious danger to
regional stability in many corners of the globe. The prolif-
eration of weapons of mass destruction represents a major
challenge to our security. Large scale environmental degra-
dation, exacerbated by rapid population growth, threatens
to undermine political stability in many countries and
regions.

At the same time, we have unparalleled opportunities to
make our nation safer and more prosperous. Our military
might is unparalleled. We now have a truly global
economy linked by an instantaneous communications
network, which offers growing scope for American jobs
and American investment. The community of democratic
nations is growing, enhancing the prospects for political
stability, peaceful conflict resolution and greater dignity
and hope for the people of the world. The international
community is beginning to act together to address pressing
global environmental needs.

Never has American leadership been more essential — to
navigate the shoals of the world’s new dangers and to
capitalize on its opportunities. American assets are unique:
our military strength, our dynamic economy, our powerful
ideals and, above all, our people. We can and must make
the difference through our engagement; but our involve-

 

ment must be carefully tailored to serve our interests and
priorities.

This report, submitted in accordance with Section 603 of
the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Department
Reorganization Act of 1986, elaborates a new national
security strategy for this new era. Focussing on new threats
and new opportunities, its central goals are:

* To credibly sustain our security with military forces
that are ready to fight.

* To bolster America’s economic revitalization.
© To promote democracy abroad.

Over the past seventeen months, my Administration has
worked to pursue these goals. This national security
strategy report presents the strategy that has guided this
effort. It is premised on a belief that the line between

our domestic and foreign policies has increasingly disap-
peared — that we must revitalize our economy if we are
to sustain our military forces, foreign initiatives and global
influence, and that we must engage actively abroad if we
are to open foreign markets and create jobs for our people.

We believe that our goals of enhancing our security,
bolstering our economic prosperity, and promoting
democracy are mutually supportive. Secure nations are
more likely to support free trade and maintain democratic
structures. Nations with growing economies and strong
trade ties are more likely to feel secure and to work toward
freedom. And democratic states are less likely to threaten

 

our interests and more likely to cooperate with the U.S. to
meet security threats and promote sustainable development.

Since my Administration began, we have taken actions to
meet these goals. To enhance global security, for example,
we have pursued peace initiatives in the Middle East,
established NATO’s Partnership for Peace, reached a
denuclearization agreement with Ukraine and Russia and
implemented a firm strategy for a non-nuclear Korean
peninsula.To bolster prosperity at home and around the
world, we have passed the North American Free Trade
Agreement, worked to open Asian-Pacific markets through
the first-ever summit meeting of the Organization for Asian
Pacific Economic Cooperation, lowered export controls
and — having successfully completed the seventh GATT
round — will now work with Congress to pass it this year.
Our actions to promote democracy include our support for
South Africa’s recent transformation, aid to a new democ-
ratic Russia and Central and Eastern European nations, and
our work with our Western Hemisphere neighbors, which
will culminate at December’s Summit of the Americas.

Even with the Cold War over, our nation must maintain
military forces that are sufficient to deter diverse threats
and, when necessary, to fight and win against our adver-
saries. While many factors ultimately contribute to our
nation’s safety and well-being, no single component is
more important than the men and women who wear
America’s uniform and stand sentry over our security.
Their skill, service and dedication constitute the core of
our defenses. Today our military is the best-equipped, best-
trained and best-prepared fighting force in the world, and |
am committed to ensure that it remains so.

Our national security strategy reflects both America’s inter-
ests and our values. Our commitment to freedom, equality
and human dignity continues to serve as a beacon of hope
to peoples around the world. The vitality, creativity and
diversity of American society are important sources of
national strength in a global economy that is dynamic,

 

multi-cultural and increasingly driven by ideas and
information.

Our prospects in this new era are promising. The specter
of nuclear annihilation has dramatically receded. The
historic events of the past year — including the handshake
between Israel and the PLO and the breakthroughs by
Nelson Mandela and F.W. DeKlerk that culminated in the
election of a multi-racial parliament and a government
headed by President Mandela — suggest this era’s
possibilities for progress toward security, prosperity and
democracy.

Our nation can only address this era’s dangers and oppor-
tunities if we remain actively engaged in global affairs. We
are the world’s greatest power, and we have global inter-
ests as well as responsibilities. As our nation learned after
World War |, we can find no security for America in isola-
tionism, nor prosperity in protectionism. For the American
people to be safer and enjoy expanding opportunities, our
nation must work to deter would-be aggressors, open
foreign markets, promote the spread of democracy abroad,
encourage sustainable development and pursue new
opportunities for peace.

Our national security requires the patient application of
American will and resources. We can only sustain that
necessary investment with the broad, bi-partisan support of
the American people and their representatives in Congress.
The full participation of Congress is essential to the success
of our new engagement, and I will consult with Congress
at every step of the policy making and implementation
process. The Cold War may be over, but the need for
American leadership abroad remains as strong as ever. |
am committed to building a new public consensus to
sustain our active engagement abroad. This document is a
part of that commitment.

|. Introduction.

A new era is upon us. The Cold War is over. The dissolu-
tion of the Soviet empire has radically transformed the
security environment facing the United States and our
allies. The primary security imperative of the past half
century — containing communist expansion while -
preventing nuclear war — is gone. We no longer face
massive Soviet forces across an East-West divide nor Soviet
missiles targeted on the United States and ready to fire. Yet
there remains a complex array of new and old security
chatlenges America must meet as we approach a new
century.

This national security strategy assesses America’s role in
this new international context and describes the
Administration’s strategy to advance our interests at home
and abroad.

This is a period of great promise but also great uncertainty.
We stand as the world’s preeminent power. America’s
core value of freedom, as embodied in democratic gover-
nance and market economics, has gained ground around
the world. Hundreds of millions of people have thrown off
communism, dictatorship or apartheid. Former adversaries
now cooperate with us in diplomacy and global problem
solving. The threat of a war among great powers and the
specter of nuclear annihilation both have receded dramati-
cally. The dynamism of the global economy is trans-
forming commerce, culture and global politics, promising
greater prosperity for America and greater cooperation
among nations.

At the same time, troubling uncertainties and clear threats
remain. The new, independent states that replaced the

 

Soviet Union are experiencing wrenching economic and
political transitions, as are many new democracies of
Central and Eastern Europe. While our relations with the
other great powers are as constructive as at any point in
this century, Russia’s future is uncertain, and China main-
tains a repressive regime even as that country assumes a
more important economic and political role in global
affairs. The spread of weapons of mass destruction poses
serious threats. Violent extremists threaten fragile peace
processes, from the Mideast to South Africa. Worldwide,
there is a resurgence of militant nationalism as well as
ethnic and religious conflict. This has been demonstrated
by upheavals in Bosnia, Rwanda and Somalia, where the
United States has participated in peacekeeping and
humanitarian missions.

Not all security risks are military in nature. Transnational
phenomena such as terrorism, narcotics trafficking, envi-
ronmental degradation, rapid population growth and
refugee flows also have security implications for both
present and long term American policy. In addition, an
emerging class of transnational environmental issues are
increasingly affecting international stability and conse-
quently will present new challenges to U.S. strategy.

American leadership in the world has never been more
important. If we exert our leadership abroad, we can make
America safer and more prosperous — by deterring aggres-
sion, by fostering the peaceful resolution of dangerous
conflicts, by opening foreign markets, by helping democ-
ratic regimes and by tackling global problems. Without our
active leadership and engagement abroad, threats will
fester and our opportunities will narrow.

 

 

We can only engage actively abroad if the American
people and the Congress are willing to bear the costs of
that leadership — in dollars, political energy and, at times,
American fives. In a democracy, the foreign policy of the
nation must serve the needs of the people. The preamble
of the Constitution sets out the basic objectives:

to provide for the common defense, promote
the general welfare, and secure the blessings of
liberty to ourselves and our posterity.

The end of the Cold War does not alter these fundamental
purposes. Nor does it reduce the need for active American
efforts, here and abroad, to pursue those goals. One
purpose of this report is to help foster the broad, bi-
partisan understanding and support necessary to sustain
our international engagement. Congressional participation
is critical to this commitment.

Our national security strategy is based on enlarging the
community of market democracies while deterring and
containing a range of threats to our nation, our allies and
our interests. The more that democracy and political and
economic liberalization take hold in the world, particularly
in countries of geostrategic importance to us, the safer our
nation is likely to be and the more our people

are likely to prosper.

To that broad end, the report explains the three central
components of our strategy of engagement and enlarge-
ment: our efforts to enhance our security by maintaining a
strong defense capability and promoting cooperative secu-
rity measures; our work to open foreign markets and spur
global economic growth; and our promotion of democracy
abroad. It also explains how we are pursuing the three
elements of our strategy in specific regions.

During this Administration’s first seventeen months, this
strategy already has begun to produce tangible results with
respect to our security requirements:

¢ At the President's direction, the Pentagon completed
the Bottom Up Review, a full-scale assessment of
what defense forces and systems our nation needs for
this new security era. The President has also set forth
a five-year defense budget that funds the force struc-
ture recommended by the Review, and he repeatedly
stressed that he will draw the line against further cuts
that would undermine that force structure or erode
U.S. military readiness.

 

¢ The President convened a NATO Summit in January
1994. The Summit approved the Partnership For
Peace and other major new initiatives, to ensure that
NATO is prepared to meet the European and trans-
Atlantic security challenges of this era, and to
provide the security relationships that will bind
former communist states to the rest of Europe. Since
then, 21 countries, including Russia, have joined the
Partnership for Peace.

© The President launched a comprehensive policy to
combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruc-
tion and the missiles that deliver them. The U.S.
opened formal negotiations on a Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty and secured landmark commitments
to eliminate all nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Belarus
and Kazakhstan.

* On May 3, 1994, President Clinton signed a
Presidential Decision Directive establishing “U.S.
Policy on Reforming Multilateral Peace Operations.”

This policy represents the first, comprehensive frame-

work for U.S. decision-making on issues of peace-

keeping and peace enforcement suited to the realities

of the post Cold War period.

On the economic front, Administration policies have
reaped dramatic successes:

¢ The President worked with the Congress on effective
measures to reduce the federal budget deficit and
restore economic growth. These measures help
increase our competitiveness and strengthen our
position in negotiations with other nations.

¢ The President secured approval of the North
American Free Trade Agreement which creates the
world’s largest free trade zone and will create
hundreds of thousands of American jobs. The vote
for NAFTA marked a decisive U.S. affirmation of its
international engagement. Through its environmental
and labor side agreements, we are working actively
to protect the rights of workers and to reduce air and
water pollution that crosses national boundaries.

¢ The Administration stood at the forefront of a multi-
lateral effort to achieve history’s most extensive
market-opening agreements in the GATT Uruguay-
round negotiations on world trade. The President is

committed to working with Congress to secure U.S.
accession this year to this pathbreaking agreement
and the resulting World Trade Organization.

© The President convened the first meeting of leaders
of the Organization for Asian Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) — and took steps to expand our
ties with the economies of the Asia-Pacific region,
the fastest growing area in the world..

* We have committed the United States to reduce its
greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year
2000, and we have developed a National Climate
Plan to achieve that goal. The United States has also
taken a leading role at the international level towards
phasing out the production of most ozone-depleting
substances. Under the Montreal Protocol for the
protection of the ozone layer, the U.S. is contributing
to developing countries’ efforts to reduce their emis-
sions of ozone-depleting chemicals. In June 1993,
the U.S. signed the Biodiversity Treaty.

* The Administration has asserted world leadership on
population issues, focussing in the context of the
upcoming Conference on Population and
Development on a plan to promote family planning,
primary health and related development strategies
that allow families to choose the number and
spacing of their children.

Finally, the President has demonstrated a firm commitment
to expanding the global realm of democracy:

© The Administration substantially expanded U.S.
support for democratic and market reform in Russia
and the other newly independent states of the former
Soviet Union.

 

¢ The United States launched a series of initiatives to
bolster the new democracies of Central and Eastern
Europe. We affirmed our concern for their security,
recognizing that such assurances would play a key
role in promoting democratic developments.

* The U.S., working with the Organization of
American States, helped reverse an anti-democratic
coup in Guatemala.

 

* The Administration led efforts to strengthen UN sanc-
tions on the military rulers of Haiti towards the end
of restoring democracy and Haiti’s democratically-
elected president.

¢ The President invited the democratic nations of the
Hemisphere to an unprecedented summit to discuss
cooperation in support of democracy in the hemi-
sphere, as well as mutual prosperity and sustainable
development.

© The U.S. has increased support for South Africa as it
conducted elections and became a multiracial
democracy.

* The Administration initiated policies aimed at crisis
prevention, including a new peacekeeping policy
and a proposed revision of the Foreign Assistance
Act.

This report has two major sections. The first part of the
report explains our strategy of engagement and enlarge-
ment. The second part describes briefly how the
Administration is applying this strategy to the world’s
major regions.

 

Il. Advancing our Interests Through

_ Engagement and

The dawn of the post-Cold War era presents the United
States with many distinct dangers, but also with a generally
improved security environment-and a range of opportuni-
ties to improve it further. The unitary threat that dominated
our engagement during the Cold War has been replaced
by a complex set of challenges, and our nation’s strategy
for defining and addressing those challenges is still
evolving. In this time of global change, it is clear we
cannot police the world; but it is equally clear we must
exercise global leadership. As the world’s premier
economic and military power, and its premier practitioner
of democratic values, the U.S. is indispensable to the
forging of stable political relations and open trade.

Our leadership must stress preventive diplomacy —
through such means as support for democracy, economic
assistance, overseas military presence, military-to-military
contacts and involvement in multilateral negotiations in
the Middle East and elsewhere — in order to help resolve
problems, reduce tensions and defuse conflicts before they
become crises. These measures are a wise investment in
our national security because they offer the prospect of
resolving problems with the least human and material cost.

Our engagement must be selective, focussing on the chal-
lenges that are most relevant to our own interests and
focussing our resources where we can make the most
difference. We must also use the right tools — being
willing to act unilaterally when our direct national interests
are most at stake; in alliance and partnership when our
interests are shared by others; and multilaterally when our
interests are more general and the problems are best
addressed by the international community. In all-cases, the
nature of our response must depend on what best serves
our own long-term national interests. Those interests are

 

Enlargement

ultimately defined by our security requirements. Such
requirements start with our physical defense and economic
well-being. They also include environmental security as
well as the security of values achieved through expansion
of the community of democratic nations.

Our national security strategy draws upon a range of polit-
ical, military and economic instruments, and focuses on
the primary objectives that President Clinton has stressed
throughout his campaign and his Administration:

¢ Enhancing Our Security. Taking account of the reali-
ties of the post-Cold War era and the new threats, a
military capability appropriately sized and postured
to meet the diverse needs of our strategy, including
the ability, in concert with regional allies, to win two
nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts. We
will continue to pursue arms control agreements to
reduce the danger of nuclear conflict and promote
stability.

* Promoting Prosperity at Home. A vigorous and _inte-
grated economic policy designed to stimulate global
environmentally sound economic growth and free
trade and to press for open and equal U.S. access to
foreign markets.

¢ Promoting Democracy. A framework of democratic
enlargement that increases our security by
protecting, consolidating and enlarging the commu-
nity of free market democracies. Our efforts focus on
preserving democratic processes in key emerging
democratic states including Russia, Ukraine and
other new states of the former Soviet Union.

 

 

These basic objectives of our national security strategy will
guide the allocation of our scarce national security
resources. Because deficit reduction is also central to the
long-term health and competitiveness of the American
economy, we are striving for the most efficient and envi-
ronmentally sound use of our resources. We have already
begun the difficult process of making these adjustments by
undertaking a fundamental review of our national defense
requirements and of the means for promoting democracy.
We have also submitted to the Congress major reform
legislation to update and streamline our international
programs.

Enhancing our Security

The U.S. government is responsible for protecting the lives
and personal safety of Americans, maintaining our political
freedom and independence as a nation and providing for
the well-being and prosperity of our nation. No matter
how powerful we are as a nation, we cannot secure these
basic goals unilaterally. Whether the problem is nuclear
proliferation, regional instability, the reversal of reform in
the former Soviet empire, or unfair trade practices, the
threats and challenges we face demand cooperative, multi-
national solutions. Therefore, the only responsible U.S.
strategy is one that seeks to ensure U.S. influence over and
participation in collective decisionmaking ina wide and
growing range of circumstances.

An important element of our security preparedness
depends on durable relationships with allies and other
friendly nations. Accordingly, a central thrust of our
strategy of engagement is to sustain and adapt the security
relationships we have with key nations around the world.
These ties constitute an important part of an international
framework that will be essential to ensuring cooperation
across a broad range of issues. Within the realm of security
issues, our cooperation with allies includes such activities
as: conducting combined training and exercises, coordi-
nating military plans and preparations, sharing intelli-
gence, jointly developing new systems, and controlling
exports of sensitive technologies according to common
standards.

The post-Cold War era presents a different set of threats to
our security. In this new period, enhancing American
security requires, first and foremost, developing and main-

 

taining a strong defense capability of forces ready to fight.
We are developing integrated approaches for dealing with
threats arising from the development of nuclear and other
weapons of mass destruction by other nations. Our secu-
rity requires a vigorous arms control effort and a strong
intelligence capability. We have implemented a strategy
for multilateral peace operations. We need to rigorously
apply clear guidelines for when to use military force in this
era.

We also face security risks that are not military in nature.
Transnational phenomena such as terrorism, narcotics traf-
ficking, and refugee flows also have security implications
both for present and long term American policy. An
emerging class of transnational environmental issues are
increasingly affecting international stability and conse-
quently will present new challenges to U.S. strategy.

Maintaining a Strong Defense Capability

U.S. military capabilities are critical to the success of our
strategy. This nation has unparalleled military capabilities:
the United States is the only nation capable of conducting
large-scale and effective military operations far beyond its
borders. This fact, coupled with our unique position as the
security partner of choice in many regions, provides a
foundation for regional stability through mutually benefi-
cial security partnerships. Our willingness and ability to
play a leading role in defending common interests also
help ensure that the United States will remain an influen-
tial voice in international affairs — political, military and
economic — that affect our well-being, so long as we
retain the military wherewithal to underwrite our commit-
ments credibly.

To protect and advance U.S. interests in the face of the
dangers and opportunities outlined earlier, the United
States must deploy robust and flexible military forces that
can accomplish a variety of tasks:

* Dealing with Major Regional Contingencies. Our
forces must be able to help offset the military power
of regional states with interests opposed to those of
the United States and its allies. To do this, we must
be able to credibly deter and defeat aggression, by
projecting and sustaining U.S. power in more than
one region if necessary.

¢ Providing a Credible Overseas Presence. U.S. forces
must also be forward deployed or stationed in key
overseas regions in peacetime to deter aggression.
Such overseas presence demonstrates our commit-
ment to allies and friends, underwrites regional
stability, gains us familiarity with overseas operating
environments, promotes combined training among
the forces of friendly countries, and provides timely
initial response capabilities.

¢ Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction. We are
devoting greater efforts to stemming the proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery
means, but at the same time we must improve our
capabilities to deter and prevent the use of such
weapons and protect ourselves against their effects.
(Our integrated program to deal with threats to our
security from weapons of mass destruction is
discussed below.)

* Contributing to Multilateral Peace Operations.
When our interests call for it, the United States must
also be prepared to participate in multilateral efforts
to broker settlements of internal conflicts and bolster
new democratic governments. Thus, our forces must
prepare to participate in peacekeeping, peace
enforcement and other operations in support of these
objectives. (Our strategy for peace operations and
the contribution of U.S. forces is discussed below.)

© Supporting Counterterrorism Efforts and Other
National Security Objectives. A number of other
tasks remain that U.S. forces have typically carried
out with both general purpose and specialized units.
These missions include: counterterrorism and puni-
tive attacks, noncombatant evacuation, counter-
narcotics operations, nation assistance, and humani-
tarian and disaster relief operations.

To meet all of these requirements successfully, our forces
must be capable of responding quickly and operating
effectively. That is, they must be ready to fight and win.
This imperative demands highly qualified and motivated
people; modern, well-maintained equipment; realistic
training; strategic mobility; and sufficient support and
sustainment capabilities.

 

Major Regional Contingencies

The focus of our planning for major theater conflict is on
deterring and, if necessary, fighting and defeating aggres-
sion by potentially hostile regional powers, such as North
Korea, Iran or Iraq. Such states are capable of fielding
sizable military forces that can cause serious imbalances in
military power within regions important to the United
States, with allied or friendly states often finding it difficult
to match the power of a potentially aggressive neighbor.
To deter aggression, prevent coercion of allied or friendly
governments and, ultimately, defeat aggression should it
occur, we must prepare our forces to confront this scale of
threat, preferably in concert with our allies and friends, but
unilaterally if necessary. To do this, we must have forces
that can deploy quickly and supplement U.S. forward
based and forward deployed forces, along with regional
allies, in halting an invasion and defeating the aggressor.

 

With programmed enhancements, the forces the
Administration is fielding will be sufficient to help defeat
aggression in two nearly simultaneous major regional
conflicts. As a nation with global interests, it is important
that the United States maintain forces with aggregate capa-
bilities on this scale. Obviously, we seek to avoid a situa-
tion in which an aggressor in one region might be tempted
to take advantage when U.S. forces are heavily committed
elsewhere. More basically, maintaining a “two war” force
helps ensure that the United States will have sufficient mili-
tary capabilities to deter or defeat aggression by a coalition
of hostile powers or by a larger, more capable adversary
than we foresee today.

We will never know with certainty how an enemy might
fight or precisely what demands might be placed on our
own forces in the future. The contributions of allies or
coalition partners will vary from place to place and over
time. Thus, balanced U.S. forces are needed in order to
provide a wide range of complementary capabilities and to
cope with the unpredictable and unexpected.

Overseas Presence

The need to deploy U.S. military forces abroad in peace-
time is also an important factor in determining our overall
force structure. We will maintain robust overseas presence
in several forms, such as permanently stationed forces,

 

 

deployments and combined exercises, port calls and other
force visits, as well as military-to-military contacts. These
activities provide several benefits. Specifically they:

*® Give form and substance to our bilateral and multi-
lateral security commitments.

¢ Demonstrate our determination to defend U.S. and
allied interests in critical regions, deterring hostile
nations from acting contrary to those interests.

* Provide forward elements for rapid response in crises
as well as the bases, ports and other infrastructure
essential for deployment of U.S.-based forces by air,
sea and land.

¢ Enhance the effectiveness of coalition operations,
including peace operations, by improving our ability
to operate with other nations.

* Allow the United States to use its position of trust to
prevent the development of power vacuums and
dangerous arms races, thereby underwriting regional
stability by precluding threats to regional security.

* Facilitate regional integration, since nations that may
not be willing to work together in our absence may
be willing to coalesce around us in a crisis.

* Promote an international security environment of
trust, cooperation, peace and stability, which is
fundamental to the vitality of developing democra-
cies and free market economies for America’s own
economic well-being and security.

Through training programs, combined exercises, military
contacts, interoperability and shared defense with potential
coalition partners, as well as security assistance programs
that include judicious foreign military sales, we can
strengthen the local self-defense capabilities of our friends
and allies. Through active participation in regional security
dialogues, we can reduce regional tensions, increase trans-
parency in armaments and improve our bilateral and
multilateral cooperation.

By improving the defense capabilities of our friends and
demonstrating our commitment to defend common inter-
ests, these activities enhance deterrence, encourage
responsibility-sharing on the part of friends and allies,
decrease the likelihood that U.S. forces will be necessary if

 

conflict arises and raise the odds that U.S. forces will find a
relatively favorable situation should a U.S. response be
required.

Counterterrorism, Fighting Drug Trafficking
and Other Missions

While the missions outlined above will remain the primary
determinants of our general purpose and nuclear force
structure, U.S. military forces and assets will also be called
upon to perform a wide range of other important missions
as well. Some of these can be accomplished by conven-
tional forces fielded primarily for theater operations. Often,
however, these missions call for specialized units and
capabilities.

Combating Terrorism

As long as terrorist groups continue to target American citi-
zens and interests, the United States will need to have
specialized units available to defeat such groups. From
time to time, we might also find it necessary to strike
terrorists at their bases abroad or to attack assets valued by
the governments that support them.

Our policy in countering international terrorists is to make
no concessions to terrorists, continue to pressure state
sponsors of terrorism, fully exploit all available legal mech-
anisms to punish international terrorists and help other
governments improve their capabilities to combat
terrorism.

Countering terrorism effectively requires close day-to-day
coordination among Executive Branch agencies. The
Departments of State, Justice and Defense, the FBI and CIA
continue to cooperate closely in an ongoing effort against
international terrorists. Positive results will come from inte-
gration of intelligence, diplomatic and rule-of-law activi-
ties, and through close cooperation with other govern-
ments and international counterterrorist organizations.

Improving U.S. intelligence capacities is a significant part
of the U.S. response. Terrorists, whether from well-orga-
nized groups or the kind of more loosely organized group
responsible for the World Trade Center bombing, have the
advantage of being able to take the initiative in the timing
and choice of targets. Terrorism involving weapons of
mass destruction represents a particularly dangerous
potential threat that must be countered.

 

 

 

The United States has made concerted efforts this past year
to punish and deter terrorists. On June 26, 1993, following
a determination that Iraq had plotted an assassination
attempt against former President Bush, President Clinton
ordered a cruise missile attack against the headquarters of
Iraq/s intelligence service in order to send a firm response
and deter further threats. Similarly, on March 4, 1994, the
United States obtained convictions against the four defen-
dants in the bombing of the World Trade Center.

U.S. leadership and close coordination with other govern-
ments and international bodies will continue, as demon-
strated by the UN Security Council sanctions against Libya
for the Pan Am 103 and UTA 772 bombings, a new inter-
national convention dealing with detecting and controlling
plastic explosives, and two important counterterrorism
treaties — the Protocol for the Suppression of Untawtul
Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Aviation
and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful
Attacks Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation.

Fighting Drug Trafficking

The Administration has undertaken a new approach to the
global scourge of drug abuse and trafficking that will better
integrate domestic and international activities to reduce
both the demand and the supply of drugs. Ultimate
success will depend on concerted efforts and partnerships
by the public, all levels of government and the American
private sector with other governments, private groups and
international bodies.

The U.S. will shift its strategy from the past emphasis on
transit interdiction to a more evenly balanced effort with
source countries to build institutions, destroy trafficking
organizations and stop supplies. We will support and
strengthen democratic institutions abroad, denying
narcotics traffickers a fragile political infrastructure in
which to operate. We will also cooperate with govern-
ments that demonstrate the political will to confront the
narcotics threat.

A new comprehensive strategy has been developed to deal
with the problem of cocaine and another is being devel-
oped to address the growing threat from high-purity heroin
entering this country. We will engage more aggressively
with international organizations, financial institutions and
nongovernmental organizations in counternarcotics coop-
eration. :

 

At home and in the international arena, prevention, treat-
ment and economic alternatives must work hand-in-hand
with law enforcement and interdiction activities. Long-
term efforts will be maintained to help nations develop
healthy economies with fewer market incentives for
producing narcotics. U.S. efforts will increase efforts
abroad to foster public awareness and support for govern-
mental cooperation on a broad range of activities to
reduce the incidence of drug abuse. Public awareness of a
demand problem in producing or trafficking countries can
be converted into public support and increased govern-
mental law enforcement to reduce trafficking and produc-
tion. There has been a significant attitudinal change and
awareness in Latin America and the Caribbean, particu-
larly as producer and transit nations themselves become
plagued with the ill effects of consumption.

Other Missions

The United States government is also responsible for
protecting the lives and safety of Americans abroad. In
order to carry out this responsibility, selected U.S. military
forces are trained and equipped to evacuate Americans
from such situations as the outbreak of civil or interna-
tional conflict and natural or man-made disasters. For
example, U.S. Marines evacuated Americans from
Monrovia, Liberia in August of 1990, and from
Mogadishu, Somalia, in December of that year. In 1991,
U.S. forces evacuated nearly 20,000 Americans from the
Philippines over a three-week period following the erup-
tion of Mount Pinatubo. This year, U.S. Marines coupled
with U.S. airlift, helped ensure the safe evacuation of U.S.
citizens from ethnic fighting in Rwanda.

U.S. forces also provide invaluable training and advice to
friendly governments threatened by subversion, lawless-
ness or insurgency. At any given time, we have small
teams of military experts deployed in roughly 25 countries
helping host governments cope with such challenges.

U.S. military forces and assets are frequently called upon

to provide assistance to victims of floods, storms, drought
and other disasters. Both at home and abroad, U.S. forces
provide emergency food, shelter, medical care and secu-

rity to those in need.

Finally, the U.S. will continue as a world leader in space
through its technical expertise and innovation. Over the
past 30 years, as more and more nations have ventured

 

into space, the U.S. has steadfastly recognized space as an
international region. Since all nations are immediately
accessible from space, the maintenance of an international
legal regime for space, similar to the concept of freedom of
the high seas, is especially important. Numerous attempts
have been made in the past to legally limit access to space
by countries that are unable, either technologically or
economically, to join space-faring nations. As the
commercial importance of space is developed, the U.S.
can expect further pressure from non-participants to rede-
fine the status of space, similar to what has been attempted
with exclusive economic zones constraining the high seas.

Retaining the current international character of space will
remain critical to achieving U.S. national security goals.
Our main objectives in this area include:

¢ Continued freedom of access to and use of space;

* Maintaining the U.S. position as the major
economic, political, military and technological
power in space;

* Deterring threats to U.S. interests in space and
defeating aggression if deterrence fails;

* Preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruc-
tion to space;

* Enhancing global partnerships with other space-
faring nations across the spectrum of economic,
political and security issues.

Deciding When and How to Employ
U.S. Forces

Our strategy calls for the development and deployment of
American military forces in the United States and abroad
to respond to key dangers — those posed by weapons of
mass destruction, regional aggression and threats to the
stability of states.

Although there may be many demands for U.S. involve-
ment, the need to husband scarce resources suggests that
we must carefully select the means and level of our partici-
pation in particular military operations. It is unwise to
specify in advance all the limitations we will place on our

10

 

use of force, but it is appropriate to identify several basic
principles that will guide our decisions on when to use
force. ;

First, and foremost, our national interests will dictate the
pace and extent of our engagement. In all cases, the costs
and risks of U.S. military involvement must be judged to
be commensurate with the stakes involved. In those
specific areas where our vital or survival interests — those
of broad, overriding importance to the survival, security
and vitality of our national entity — are at stake, our use of
force will be decisive and, if necessary, unilateral. In other
situations posing a less immediate threat, our military
engagement must be targeted selectively on those areas
that most affect our national interests — for instance, areas
where we have a sizable economic stake or commitments
to allies, and areas where there is a potential to generate
substantial refugee flows into our nation or our allies.

Second, as much as possible, we will seek the help of our
allies or of relevant multilateral institutions. If our most
important national interests are at stake, we are prepared
to act alone. But especially on those matters touching
directly the interests of our allies, there should be a propor-
tional commitment from them.

Third, in every case, we will consider several critical ques-
tions before committing military force. Have we consid-
ered nonmilitary means that offer a reasonable chance of
success? What types of U.S. military capabilities should
be brought to bear, and is the use of military force care-
fully matched to our political objectives? Do we have
reasonable assurance of support from the American people
and their elected representatives? Do we have timelines
and milestones that will reveal the extent of success or
failure, and, in either case, do we have an exit strategy?

Fourth, our engagement must meet reasonable cost and
feasibility thresholds. We will be more inclined to act
where there is reason to believe that our action will bring
lasting improvement. On the other hand, our involvement
will be more circumscribed when other regional or multi-
lateral actors are better positioned to act than we are. Even
in these cases, however, the United States will be actively
engaged at the diplomatic level.

 

Combatting the Spread and Use of
Weapons of Mass Destruction and
Missiles

Weapons of mass destruction — nuclear, biological, and
chemical — along with the missiles that deliver them, pose
a major threat to our security and that of our allies and
other friendly nations. Thus, a key part of our strategy is to
seek to stem the proliferation of such weapons and to
develop an effective capability to deal with these threats.
We also need to maintain robust strategic nuclear forces
while seeking to implement existing strategic arms
agreements.

Nonproliferation and Counterproliferation

A critical priority for the United States is to stem the prolif-
eration of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass
destruction and their missile delivery systems. Countries’
weapons programs, and their levels of cooperation with
our nonproliferation efforts, will be among our most
important criteria in judging the nature of our bilateral
relations.

As a key part of our effort to control nuclear proliferation,
we seek the indefinite extension of the Nonproliferation
Treaty (NPT) beyond 1995 and its universal application.
Achieving a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as soon as
possible, ending the unsafeguarded production of fissile
materials for nuclear weapons purposes and strengthening
the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) are important goals. They comple-
ment our comprehensive efforts to discourage the accumu-
lation of fissile materials, to seek to strengthen controls and
constraints on those materials, and over time, to reduce
world-wide stocks.

To combat missile proliferation, the United States seeks
prudently to broaden membership of the Missile
Technology Control Regime (MTCR). The Administration
supports the prompt ratification and earliest possible entry
in force of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) as
well as new measures to deter violations of and enhance
compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention
(BWC). We also support improved export controls for
nonproliferation purposes both domestically and
multtilaterally.

 

The proliferation problem is global, but we must tailor our
approaches to specific regional contexts. We are leading
international efforts to bring North Korea into compliance
with its nonproliferation obligations, including the NPT,
IAEA safeguards, and the North-South denuclearization
accord. We will continue efforts to prevent Iran from
advancing its weapons of mass destruction objectives and
to thwart lraq from reconstituting its previous programs.
The United States seeks to cap, reduce and, ultimately,
eliminate the nuclear and missile capabilities of India and
Pakistan. In the Middle East and elsewhere, we encourage
regional arms control agreements that address the legiti-
mate security concerns of all parties. These tasks are being
pursued with other states that share our concern for the
enormous challenge of stemming the proliferation of such
weapons.

The United States has signed bilateral agreements with
Russia and Ukraine, which commit both these countries to
adhere to the guidelines of the MTCR. Russia has agreed
not to transfer space-launch vehicle technology with
potential military applications to India. South Africa has
joined the NPT and accepted full-scope safeguards.
Argentina has joined the MTCR and Brazil has committed
itself publicly to adhere to the MTCR guidelines.
Argentina, Brazil and Chile have brought the Treaty of
Tlatelolco into force. We continue to push for the disman-
tlement of intercontinental ballistic missiles located in
Ukraine and Kazakhstan and to press China to formalize
its earlier MTCR undertakings. With the United States and
Russia, Ukraine is pressing forward on implementation of
the Trilateral Accord, which provides for the transfer of
warheads from Ukraine to Russia in return for fair compen-
sation for their value.

Thus, the United States seeks to prevent additional coun-
tries from acquiring chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons and the means to deliver them. However, should
such efforts fail, U.S. forces must be prepared to deter,
prevent and defend against their use.

The United States will retain the capacity to retaliate
against those who might contemplate the use of weapons
of mass destruction, so that the costs of such use will be
seen as outweighing the gains. However, to minimize the
impact of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction on
our interests, we will need the capability not only to deter
their use against either ourselves or our allies and friends,
but also, where necessary and feasible, to prevent it.

VW

 

 

This will require improved defensive capabilities. To mini-
mize the vulnerability of our forces abroad to weapons of
mass destruction, we are placing a high priority on
improving our ability to locate, identify, and disable arse-
nals of weapons of mass destruction, production and
storage facilities for such weapons, and their delivery
systems.

Strategic Nuclear Forces.

We will retain strategic nuclear forces sufficient to deter
any future hostile foreign leadership with access to
strategic nuclear forces from acting against our vital inter-
ests and to convince it that seeking a nuclear advantage
would be futile. Therefore we will continue to maintain
nuclear forces of sufficient size and capability to hold at
risk a broad range of assets valued by such political and
military leaders. We are engaged in a review to determine
what nuclear posture is required in the current world situa-
tion.

The strategic arms control process, with its prescribed
reductions in strategic offensive arms and steady shift
toward less destabilizing systems, remains indispensable.
The U.S. is committed to the ratification and entry into
force of the START | and II Treaties. Although Ukraine has
yet to accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Rada’s
action on 3 February 1994 to ratify the START | Treaty and
the Lisbon Protocol without reservations places Ukraine
back on track toward becoming a Non-Nuclear Weapons
State. The U.S. is also reviewing whether future reductions
in strategic forces below START II levels are advisable. We
will also explore strategic confidence-building measures
and mutual understandings that reduce the risk of
accidental war.

Arms Control

Arms control is an integral part of our national security
strategy. Arms control can help reduce incentives to initiate
attack; enhance predictability regarding the size and struc-
ture of forces, thus reducing fear of aggressive intent;
reduce the size of national defense industry establishments
and thus permit the growth of more vital, nonmilitary
industries; ensure confidence in compliance through effec-
tive monitoring and verification; and, ultimately, contribute
to a more stable and calculable balance of power.

12

 

As noted above, arms control is an integral part of our
strategy to limit the spread of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons, and to limit the strategic nuclear
forces which could still pose a direct threat to the United
States.

The full and faithful implementation of existing arms
control agreements, including the ABM Treaty, BWC, INF,
CFE, several nuclear testing agreements, the 1992 Vienna
Document on CSBMs, Open Skies, the Environmental
Modification Convention (EnMod), Incidents at Sea and
many others will remain an important element of national
security policy. The on-going negotiation initiated by the
United States to clarify the ABM Treaty by establishing an
agreed demarcation between strategic and theater ballistic
missiles and update the Treaty to reflect the break-up of
the Soviet Union reflects the Administration’s commitment
to maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of crucial
arms control agreements.

Future arms control efforts may become more regional and
multilateral. Regional arrangements can add predictability
and openness to security relations, advance the rule of
international law and promote cooperation among partici-
pants. They help maintain deterrence and a stable military
balance at regional levels. The U.S. is prepared to
promote, help negotiate, monitor and participate in
regional arms control undertakings compatible with
American national security interests. We will generally
support such undertakings but will not seek to impose
regional arms contro! accords against the wishes of
affected states.

As arms control, whether regional or global, becomes
increasingly multilateral, the Conference on Disarmament
(CD) in Geneva will play an even more important role.
The U.S. will support measures to increase the effective-
ness and relevance of the CD. Arms control agreements
can head off potential arms races in certain weapons cate-
gories or in some environments. We will continue to seek
greater transparency, responsibility and, where appro-
priate, restraint in the transfer of conventional weapons
and global military spending must increase. The UN
register of conventional arms transfers is a start in
promoting greater transparency of weapons transfers and
buildups, but more needs to be done. The U.S. has
proposed that the new regime to succeed the Coordinating
Committee (COCOM) focus on conventional arms sales
and dual-use technologies. Where appropriate, the United

States will continue to pursue such efforts vigorously.
Measures to reduce over-sized defense industrial establish-
ments, especially those parts involved with weapons of
mass destruction, will also contribute to stability in the
post-Cold War world. The Administration also will pursue
defense conversion agreements with FSU states, and
possibly China.

Peace Operations

In addition to preparing for major regional contingencies,
we must prepare our forces for peace operations to support
democracy or conflict resolution. The United States, along
with others in the international community, will seek to
prevent and contain localized conflicts before they require
a military response. U.S. support capabilities such as airlift,
intelligence, and global communications, have often
contributed to the success of multilateral peace operations,
and they will continue to do so. U.S. combat units are less
likely to be used for most peace operations, but in some
cases their use will be necessary or desirable and justified
by U.S. national interests as guided by the Presidential
Decision Directive, “U.S. Policy on Reforming Multilateral
Peace Operations,” and outlined below.

Multilateral peace operations are an important component
of our strategy. From traditional peacekeeping to peace
enforcement, multilateral peace operations are sometimes
the best way to prevent, contain, or resolve conflicts that
could otherwise be far more costly and deadly.

Peace operations often have served, and continue to serve,
important U.S. national interests. In some cases, they have
helped preserve peace between nations, as in Cyprus and
the Golan Heights. In others, peacekeepers have provided
breathing room for fledgling democracies, as in Cambodia,
EI Salvador and Namibia.

At the same time, however, we must recognize that peace
operations make demands on the UN that exceed the
organization’s current capabilities. The United States is
working with the UN headquarters and other member
states to ensure that the UN embarks only on peace oper-
ations that make political and military sense and that the
UN is able to manage effectively those peace operations it
does undertake. We support the creation of a professional
UN peace operations headquarters with a planning staff,
access to timely intelligence, a logistics unit that can be
rapidly deployed and a modern operations center with

 

global communications. The United States is committed to
working with the United Nations to see that we pay our
bilts in full, while reducing our nation’s proportional
assessment for these missions.

When deciding whether to support a particular UN peace
operation, the United States will insist that fundamental
questions be asked before new obligations are undertaken.
These include an assessment of the threat to international
peace and security, a determination that the peace opera-
tion serves U.S. interests as well as assurance of an interna-
tional community of interests for dealing with that threat
on a multilateral basis, identification of clear objectives,
availability of the necessary resources, and identification of
an operation’s endpoint or criteria for completion.

Most UN peacekeeping operations do not involve U.S.
forces. On those occasions when we consider contributing
U.S. forces to a UN peace operation, we will employ
rigorous criteria, including the same principles that would
guide any decision to employ U.S. forces. In addition, we
will ensure that the risks to U.S. personnel and the
command and control arrangements governing the partici-
pation of American and foreign forces are acceptable to
the United States.

The question of command and control is particularly crit-
ical. There may be times when it is in our interest to place
U.S. troops under the temporary operational control of a
competent UN or allied commander. The United States
has done so many times in the past — from the siege of
Yorktown in the Revolutionary War to the battles of Desert
Storm. However, under no circumstances will the
President ever relinquish his command authority over U.S.
forces.

Improving the ways the United States and the UN decide
upon and conduct peace operations will not make the
decision to engage any easier. The lesson we must take
away from our first ventures in peace operations is not that
we should foreswear such operations but that we should
employ this too! selectively and more effectively. In short,
the United States views peace operations as a means to
support our national security strategy, not as a strategy
unto itself.

The President is firmly committed to securing the active
support of Congress for U.S. participation in peace opera-
tions. The Administration has set forth a detailed blueprint

13

 

 

 

to guide consultations with Congress. With respect to
particular operations, the Administration will undertake
such consultations on questions regarding command and
control of U.S. forces, the nature of expected U.S. military
participation, the mission parameters of the operation, the
expected duration, and budgetary implications. In addition
to such operation-specific consultations, the
Administration has also conducted regular monthly brief-
ings for congressional staff, and will deliver an Annual
Comprehensive Report to Congress on Peace Operations.
Congress is critical to the institutional development of a
successful U.S. policy on peace operations.

Two other points deserve emphasis. First, the primary
mission of our Armed Forces is not peace operations; it is
to deter and, if necessary, to fight and win conflicts in
which our most important interests are threatened.
Second, while the international community can create
conditions for peace, the responsibility for peace ulti-
mately rests with the people of the country in question.

Strong Intelligence Capabilities

Only a strong intelligence effort can provide adequate
warning of threats to U.S. national security and identify
opportunities for advancing our interests. Policy analysts,
decision makers and military commanders at all levels wilt
continue to rely on our intelligence community to collect
and analyze information unavailable from other sources
and which provides an essential complement to foreign
service reporting, media reports and private analysts who
rely entirely on open sources.

Because national security has taken on a much broader
definition in this post-Cold War era, intelligence must
address a much wider range of threats and dangers. We
will continue to monitor military and technical threats, to
guide long-term force development and weapons acquisi-
tion, and to directly support military operations.
Intelligence will also be critical for directing new efforts
against regional conflicts, proliferation of WMD, counter-
intelligence, terrorism and narcotics trafficking. In order to
adequately forecast dangers to democracy and to U.S.
economic well-being, the intelligence community must
track political, economic, social and military develop-
ments in those parts of the world where U.S. interests are
most heavily engaged and where overt collection of infor-
mation from open sources is inadequate. Finally, to
enhance the study and support of worldwide environ-

14

 

mental, humanitarian and disaster relief activities, tech-
nical intelligence assets (principally imagery) must be
directed to a greater degree towards collection of data on
these subjects.

Economic intelligence will play an increasingly important
role in helping policy makers understand economic trends.
Economic intelligence can support U.S. trade negotiators
and help level the economic playing field by identifying
threats to U.S. companies from foreign intelligence
services and unfair trading practices.

This strategy requires that we take steps to reinforce
current intelligence capabilities and overt foreign service
reporting, within the limits of our resources, and similar
steps to enhance coordination of clandestine and overt
collection. Key goals include to:

* Provide timely warning of strategic threats, whether
from the remaining arsenal of weapons in the former
Soviet Union or from other nations with weapons of
mass destruction;

* Ensure timely intelligence support to military opera-
tions;

* Provide early warning of potential crises and facili-
tate preventive diplomacy;

* Develop new strategies for collection, production
and dissemination (including closer relationships
between intelligence producers and consumers) to
make intelligence products more responsive to
current consumer needs;

*¢ Improve worldwide technical capabilities to detect,
identify and determine the efforts of foreign nations
to develop weapons of mass destruction;

* Improve counterintelligence efforts;
© Provide focussed support for law enforcement agen-
cies in areas like counternarcotics, counterterrorism

and illegal technology trade;

* Streamline intelligence operations and organizations
to gain efficiency and integration;

 

 

 

* Revise long-standing security restrictions where
possible to make intelligence data more useful to
intelligence consumers.

Strengthen intelligence relationships and sharing
with friendly foreign intelligence services, especially
in areas where U.S. intelligence capabilities are
limited.

The Environment

The more clearly we understand the complex interrelation-
ships between the different parts of our world’s environ-
ment, the better we can understand the regional and even
global effects of local changes to the environment.
Increasing competition for the dwindling reserves of
uncontaminated air, arable land, fisheries and other food
sources, and water, once considered “free” goods, is
already a very real risk to regional stability around the
world. The range of environmental risks serious enough to
jeopardize international stability extends to massive popu-
lation flight from man-made or natural catastrophes, such
as Chernoby! or the East African drought, and to large-
scale ecosystem damage caused by industrial pollution,
deforestation, loss of biodiversity, ozone depletion, and
ultimately climate change. Strategies dealing with environ-
mental issues of this magnitude will require partnerships
between governments and nongovernmental organiza-
tions, cooperation between nations and regions, and a
commitment to a strategically focused, long-term policy for
emerging environmental risks.

The decisions we make today regarding military force
structures typically influence our ability to respond to
threats 20 to 30 years in the future. Similarly, our current
decisions regarding the environment will affect the magni-
tude of its security risks over at least a comparable period
of time, if not longer. The measure of our difficulties in the
future will be settled by the steps we take in the present.

As a priority initiative, the U.S. will press the global
community at the September Cairo Conference and in
other fora, to address the continuous climb in global popu-
lation. Rapid population growth in the developing world
and unsustainable consumption patterns in industrialized
nations are the root of both present and potentially even
greater forms of environmental degradation and resource
depletion. A conservative estimate of the globe’s popula-
tion projects 8.5 billion people on the planet by the year

 

2025. Even when making the most generous allowances
for advances in science and technology, one cannot help
but conclude that population growth and environmental
pressures will feed into immense sociat unrest and make
the world substantially more vulnerable to serious interna-
tional frictions.

Promoting Prosperity at Home

A central goal of our national security strategy is to
promote America’s prosperity through efforts both at home
and abroad. Our economic and security interests are
increasingly inseparable. Our prosperity at home depends
on engaging actively abroad. The strength of our diplo-
macy, our ability to maintain an unrivaled military, the
attractiveness of our values abroad — all these depend in
part on the strength of our economy.

Enhancing American Competitiveness

Our primary economic goal is to strengthen the American
economy and reverse the decline in American competi-
tiveness that plagued our international economic perfor-
mance for over a decade. The first step toward that goal
was reducing the federal deficit and the burden it imposes
on the economy and future generations. The economic
program passed in 1993 will reduce the deficit by over
$500 million, restored investor confidence in the U.S. and
strengthened our position in international economic nego-
tiations. We are building on this deficit reduction effort
with other steps to improve American competitiveness:
investing in technology; assisting defense conversion;
improving information networks and other vital infrastruc-
ture; and improving education and training programs for
America’s workforce. We are structuring our defense R&D
effort to place greater emphasis on dual-use technologies
that can enhance competitiveness and meet pressing mili-
tary needs. We are also reforming the defense acquisition
system so that we can develop and procure weapons and
materiel more efficiently.

Partnership with Business and Labor

Our economic strategy views the private sector as the
engine of economic growth. It sees government's role as a
partner to the private sector — acting as an advocate of
U.S. business interests; teveling the playing field in interna-

15

 

tional markets; helping to boost American exports; and
finding ways to remove domestic and foreign barriers to
the creativity, initiative and productivity of American
business.

To this end, on September 29, 1993, the Administration
published its report creating America’s first national export
strategy and making 65 specific recommendations for
reforming the way government works with the private
sector to expand exports. Among the recommendations
were significant improvements in advocacy, export
financing, market information systems and product stan-
dards education. The results of these reforms could enable
U.S. exports to reach the trillion dollar mark by the turn of
the century, which would help create at least six million
new American jobs.

Another critical element in boosting U.S. exports is
reforming the outdated export licensing system. Last year,
that reform began with significant liberalization of export
licensing controls for computers, supercomputers and
telecommunications equipment. This year the
Administration is seeking comprehensive reform of the
Export Administration Act, which governs the process of
export licensing. The goal of this reform is to strengthen
our ability to prevent proliferation and protect other
national interests, while removing unnecessarily burden-
some licensing requirements left over from the Cold War.

Enhancing Access to Foreign Markets

The success of American business is more than ever
dependent upon success in international markets. The
ability to compete internationally also assures that our
companies will continue to innovate and increase produc-
tivity, which will in turn lead to improvements in our own
living standards. But to compete abroad, our firms need
access to foreign markets, just as foreign industries have
access to our open market. We vigorously pursue
measures to increase access for our companies — through
bilateral, regional and multilateral arrangements.

The North American Free Trade Agreement
On December 3, 1993, President Clinton signed the North

American Free Trade Act (NAFTA), which creates a free
trade zone among the United States, Canada and Mexico.

16

 

NAFTA will create more than 200,000 American jobs and
it increases Mexico’s capacity to cooperate with our nation
on a wide range of issues that cross our 2000 mile border
— including the environment, narcotics trafficking and
illegal immigration.

Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation

Our economic relations depend vitally on our ties with the
Asia Pacific region, which is the world’s fastest-growing
economic region. In November 1993, President Clinton
convened the first-ever summit of the leaders of the
economies that constitute the Organization for Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC). U.S. initiatives in the APEC
forum will open new opportunities for economic coopera-
tion and permit U.S. companies to become involved in
substantial infrastructure planning and construction
throughout the region. The trade and investment frame-
work agreed to in 1993 provides the basis for enhancing
the “open regionalism” that defines APEC.

Uruguay Round of GATT

The successful conclusion in December 1993 of the
Uruguay Round of the negotiations under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) significantly
strengthened the world trading system. The Uruguay
Round accord is the largest, most comprehensive trade
agreement in history. It will create hundreds of thousands
of new U.S. jobs and expand opportunities for U.S. busi-
nesses. For the first time, international trade rules will
apply to services, intellectual property and investments,
and effective rules will apply to agriculture. The Uruguay
Round also continued the cuts in tariff rates throughout the
world that began just after the Second World War. The
Administration is committed to working with Congress to
passing GATT this year and ensuring that the promises
made to American industries in the Uruguay Round are
fulfilled.

U.S. - Japan Framework Agreement

While Japan is America’s second-largest export market,
foreign access to the Japanese market remains limited in
many important sectors. Japan’s persistent current account
surpluses are a major imbalance in the global economy. In
July 1993 President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister

 

Miyazawa established the U.S.-Japan Framework for
Economic Partnership to redress the imbalances in our
economic relationship. By the February 1994 Summit
between President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa,
Japan had not yet fulfilled key commitments under the
Framework agreement. The Administration is continuing
efforts to ensure that competitive American goods and
services have fair access to the Japanese market. We
believe Japan must take measures to open its markets and
stimulate its economy, both to benefit its own people and
to fulfill its international responsibilities

Expanding the Realm of Free Trade

The conclusion of NAFTA and the Uruguay Round repre-
sents unprecedented progress toward more open markets
both at the regional and global levels. The Administration
intends to continue its efforts in further enhancing U.S.
access to foreign markets. The World Trade Organization
will provide a powerful new institutional lever for securing
such access. Emerging markets, particularly along the
Pacific Rim, present vast opportunities for American enter-
prise, and APEC now provides a suitable vehicle for the
exploration of such opportunities. The U.S. may also be
amenable to the possible establishment of free trade
regimes with other nations. All such steps in the direction
of expanded trading relationships will be undertaken in a
way consistent with protection of the international envi-
ronment and to the end of sustainable development here
and abroad.

Strengthening Macroeconomic
Coordination

As national economies become more integrated interna-
tionally, the U.S. cannot drive global growth on its own.
International economic expansion will benefit from coordi-
nating the macroeconomic policies of the G-7 economies,
and especially the three major economies of the world —
the United States, Germany and Japan. To improve global
macroeconomic performance, we will continue to work
through the G-7 “heads of state” and financial leader
meetings to seek growth-oriented policies to complement
our own budget deficit reduction efforts. Together we can
promulgate a growth strategy that combines reducing
budget deficits in the U.S., lowering interest rates in
Germany and reducing current account surpluses in Japan.

 

Providing for Energy Security

The United States depends on oil for more than 40% of its
primary energy needs. Roughly 45% of our oil needs are
met with imports, and a large share of these imports come
from the Persian Gulf area. The experiences of the two oil
shocks and the Gulf War show that an interruption of oil
supplies can have a significant impact on the U.S.
economy. Appropriate economic responses can substan-
tially mitigate the balance of payments and inflationary
impacts of an oi! shock; appropriate foreign policy
responses to events such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait can
limit the magnitude of the crisis.

Over the longer term, the United States’ dependence on
access to foreign oil sources will be increasingly important
as our resources are depleted. The U.S. economy has
grown roughly 75% since the first oil shock; yet during
that time our oi! consumption has remained virtually stable
and oil production has declined. High oil prices did not
generate enough new oil exploration and discovery to
sustain production levels from our depleted resource base.
These facts show the need for continued and extended
reliance on energy efficiency and conservation and devel-
opment of alternative energy sources. Conservation
measures notwithstanding, the U.S. has a vital interest in
unrestricted access to this critical resource.

Promoting Sustainable Development
Abroad

Broad-based economic development not only improves
the prospects for democratic development in developing
countries, but also expands the demands for U.S. exports.
Economic growth abroad can alleviate pressure on the
global environment, reduce the attraction of illegal
narcotics trade and improve the health and economic
productivity of global populations.

The environmental aspects of ill-designed economic

growth are clear. Environmental damage will ultimately
block economic growth. Rapid urbanization is outstripping
the ability of nations to provide jobs, education, and other .
services to new citizens. The continuing poverty of a
quarter of the world’s people leads to hunger, malnutrition,
economic migration, and political unrest. Widespread iltit-
eracy and lack of technical skills hinder employment

17

 

 

opportunities and drive entire populations to support them-
selves on increasingly fragile and damaged resource bases.
New diseases and epidemics, often spread through envi-
ronmental degradation, threaten to overwhelm the health
facilities of developing countries, disrupt societies, and
stop economic growth. These realities must be addressed
by sustainable development programs which offer viable
alternatives. U.S. leadership is of the essence. if such alter-
natives are not developed, the consequences for the
planet's future will be grave indeed.

Domestically, the U.S. must work hard to halt local and
cross-border environmental degradation. In addition, the
U.S, should foster environmental technology targeting
pollution prevention, control, and cleanup. Companies
that invest in energy efficiency, clean manufacturing, and
environmental services today will create the high-quality,
high-wage jobs of tomorrow. By providing access to these
types of technologies, our exports can also provide the
means for other nations to achieve environmentally
sustainable economic growth. At the same time, we are
taking ambitious steps at home to better manage our
natural resources and reduce energy and other consump-
tion, decrease waste generation, and increase our recy-
cling efforts.

internationally, the Administration’s foreign assistance
program focuses on four key elements of sustainable
development: broad-based economic growth; the environ-
ment; population and health; and democracy. We will
continue to advocate environmentally sound private
investment and responsible approaches by international
lenders. At our urging, the Multilateral Development Banks
(MDB’s) are now placing increased emphasis upon
sustainable development in their funding decisions, to
include a commitment to perform environmental assess-
ments on projects for both internal and public scrutiny. In
particular, the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), estab-
lished this year, will provide a source of financial assis-
tance to the developing world for climate change, biodi-
versity, and oceans initiatives.

The U.S. is taking specific steps now in all of these areas:
¢ In June 1993, the United States signed the
Convention on Biological Diversity, which aims to

protect and utilize the world’s genetic inheritance.
The Interior Department has been directed to create

18

 

a national biological survey to help protect species
and to help the agricultural and biotechnica! indus-
tries identify new sources of food, fiber and medica-
tions.

* New policies are being implemented to ensure the
sustainable management of U.S. forests by the year
2000, as pledged internationally. In addition, U.S.
bilateral forest assistance programs are being
expanded, and the United States is promoting
sustainable management of tropical forests.

Inthe wake of the 1992 United Nations Conference
on Environment and Development, the United States
has sought to reduce land-based sources of marine
pollution, maintain populations of marine species at
healthy and productive levels and protect endan-
gered marine mammals.

© The United States has focussed technical assistance
and encouraged nongovernmental environmental
groups to provide expertise to the republics of the
Former Soviet Union and East European nations that
have suffered the most acute environmental crises.
The Agency for International Development, the
Environmental Protection Agency and other U.S.
agencies are engaged in technical cooperation with
many countries around the world to advance these
goals.

* The Administration is leading a renewed global effort
to address population problems and promote inter-
national consensus for stabilizing world population
growth. Our comprehensive approach will stress
family planning and reproductive health care,
maternal and child health, education, and improving
the status of women. The International Conference
on Population Development, to be held in
September in Cairo, will endorse these approaches
as important strategies in achieving our global popu-
lation goals.

Promoting Democracy

All of America’s strategic interests — from promoting pros-
perity at home to checking global threats abroad before
they threaten our territory — are served by enlarging the

 

community of democratic and free market nations. Thus,
working with new democratic states to help preserve them
as democracies committed to free markets and respect for
human rights, is a key part of our national security strategy.

One of the most gratifying and encouraging developments
of the past 15 years is the explosion in the number of states
moving away from repressive governance and toward
democracy. Since the success of many of those experi-
ments is by no means assured, our strategy of enlargement
must focus on the consolidation of those regimes and the
broadening of their commitment to democracy. At the
same time, we seek to increase respect for fundamental
human rights in all states and encourage an evolution to
democracy where that is possible.

The enlargement of the community of market democracies
respecting human rights and the environment is manifest
in a number of ways:

© More than 20 nations in Eastern Europe, the former
Soviet Union, Latin America, and East Asia have,
over the past 10 years, adopted the structures of a
constitutional democracy and held free elections;

* The nations of the Western Hemisphere have
proclaimed their commitment to democratic regimes
and to the collective responsibility of the nations of
the OAS to respond to threats to democracy.

* Inthe Western Hemisphere, only Cuba and Haiti are
not democratic states;

© Nations as diverse as South Africa, Cambodia and El
Salvador have resolved bitter internal disputes
with agreement on the creation of constitutional
democracies.

The first element of our democracy strategy is to work with
the other democracies of the world and to improve our
cooperation with them on security and economic issues.
We also seek their support in enlarging the realm of demo-
cratic nations.

The core of our strategy is to help democracy and markets
expand and survive in other places where we have the
strongest security concerns and where we can make the
greatest difference. This is not a democratic crusade; it is a

 

pragmatic commitment to see freedom take hold where
that will help us most. Thus, we must target our effort to
assist states that affect our strategic interests, such as those
with large economies, critical locations, nuclear weapons,
or the potential to generate refugee flows into our own
nation or into key friends and allies. We must focus our
efforts where we have the most leverage. And our efforts
must be demand-driven — they must focus on nations
whose people are pushing for reform or have already
secured it.

Russia is a key state in this regard. If we can support and
help consolidate democratic and market reforms in Russia
(and the other newly independent states), we can help turn
a former threat into a region of valued diplomatic and
economic partners. In addition, our efforts in Russia,
Ukraine and the other states raise the likelihood of
continued reductions in nuclear arms and compliance
with international nonproliferation accords.

The new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe are
another clear example, given their proximity to the great

’ democratic powers of Western Europe, their importance to

our security, and their potential markets.

Since our ties across the Pacific are no less important than
those across the Atlantic, pursuing enlargement in the
Asian Pacific is a third example. We will work to support
the emerging democracies of the region and to encourage
other states along the same path.

Continuing the great strides toward democracy and
markets in our emerging hemisphere is also a key concern
and lies behind the President’s decision to host the Summit
of the Americas this December. As we continue such
efforts, we should be on the lookout for states whose entry
into the camp of market democracies may influence the
future direction of an entire region; South Africa and
Nigeria now hold that potential with regard to sub-Saharan
Africa.

How should the United States help consolidate and
enlarge democracy and markets in these states? The
answers are as varied as the nations involved, but there are
common elements. We must continue to help lead the
effort to mobilize international resources, as we have with
Russia and the other new states. We must be willing to
take immediate public positions to help staunch democ-

19

 

ratic reversals, as we have in Haiti, Guatemala and
Nigeria. We must give democratic nations the fullest bene-
fits of integration into foreign markets, which is part of why
NAFTA and the GATT rank so high on our agenda. And
we must help these nations strengthen the pillars of civil
society, improve their market institutions, and fight corrup-
tion and political discontent through practices of good
governance.

At the same time as we work to ensure the success of
emerging democracies, we must also redouble our efforts
to guarantee basic human rights on a global basis. At the
1993 United Nations Conference on Human Rights, the
U.S. forcefully and successfully argued for a reaffirmation
of the universality of such rights and improved interna-
tional mechanisms for their promotion. In the wake of this
gathering, the UN has named a High Commissioner for
Human Rights, and the rights of women have been
afforded a new international precedence. The U.S. also
continues to work for the protection of human rights on a
bilateral basis. To demonstrate our own willingness to
adhere to international human rights standards, the
Administration will seek Senate consent to U.S. ratification
of international conventions prohibiting discrimination on
the basis of race and against women.

In all these efforts, a policy of engagement and enlarge-
ment should take on a second meaning: we should
pursue our goals through an enlarged circle not only of
government officials but also of private and non-govern-
mental groups. Private firms are natural allies in our efforts
to strengthen market economies. Similarly, our goal of
strengthening democracy and civil society has a natural
ally in !abor unions, human rights groups, environmental
advocates, chambers of commerce, and election monitors.
Just as we rely on force multipliers in defense, we should
welcome these “diplomacy multipliers,” such as the
National Endowment for Democracy.

Supporting the global movement toward democracy
requires a pragmatic and long-term effort focussed on both
values and institutions. The United States must build on
the opportunities achieved through the successful conclu-

20

 

sion of the Cold War. Our long-term goal is a world in
which each of the major powers is democratic, with many
other nations joining the community of market democra-
cies as well.

Our efforts to promote democracy and human rights are
complemented by our humanitarian assistance programs
which are designed to alleviate human suffering and to
pave the way for progress towards establishing democratic
regimes with a commitment to respect for human rights
and appropriate strategies for economic development.

Through humanitarian assistance and policy initiatives
aimed at the sources of disruption, we seek to mitigate the
contemporary migration and refugee crises, foster long-
term global cooperation and strengthen involved interna-
tional institutions. The U.S. will provide appropriate finan-
cial support and will work with other nations and interna-
tional bodies, such as the International Red Cross and the
UN High Commissioner for Refugees, in seeking voluntary
repatriation of refugees — taking into full consideration
human rights concerns as well as the economic conditions
that may have driven them out in the first place. Helping
refugees return to their homes in Mozambique,
Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia and Guatemala, for example,
is a high priority.

Relief efforts will continue for people displaced by the
conflict in Bosnia and other republics of the former
Yugoslavia. We will act in concert with other nations and
the UN against the illegal smuggling of Chinese into this
country. Efforts will continue to induce the military forces
in Haiti to accept the installation of its democratically
elected government, in part to help stem the flow of
Haitians attempting entry into the United States.

 

 

III. Integrated Regional
Approaches

The United States is a genuinely global power. Our policy
toward each of the world’s regions reflects our overall
strategy tailored to their unique challenges and opportuni-
ties. This section highlights the application of our strategy
to each of the world’s regions; our broad objectives and
thrust, rather than an exhaustive list of all our policies and
interests. It illustrates how we integrate our commitment to
the promotion of democracy and the enhancement of
American prosperity with our security requirements to
produce a mutually reinforcing policy.

Europe and Eurasia

Our strategy of enlargement and engagement is central to
U.S. policy towards post-Cold War Europe. European
stability is vital to our own security, a lesson we have
learned twice at great cost this century. Vibrant European
economies mean more jobs for Americans at home and
investment opportunities abroad. With the collapse of the
Soviet empire and the emergence of new democracies in
its wake, the United States has an unparalleled opportunity
to contribute toward a free and undivided Europe. Our
goal is an integrated democratic Europe cooperating
with the United States to keep the peace and promote

prosperity.

The first and most important element of our strategy in
Europe must be security through military strength and
cooperation. The Cold War is over, but war itself is not
over.

As we know, it rages in the former Yugoslavia. While that
war does not pose an immediate threat to our security or
warrant unilateral U.S. involvement, U.S. policy is

 

focussed on four goals: preventing the spread of the
fighting into a broader European war that could threaten
both allies and the stability of new democratic states in
Central and Eastern Europe; stemming the destabilizing
flow of refugees from the conflict; halting the slaughter of
innocents; and helping to confirm NATO’s central role in
post-Cold War Europe.

 

Our leadership paved the way to NATO’s February
ultimatum that ended the Serb shelling of Sarajevo and
restored calm to Bosnia’s capital. Our diplomatic leader-
ship brought an end to the fighting between the Muslims
and Croats in Bosnia and helped establish a bicommunal
Bosnian-Croat Federation. We have played a leading role
in the Contact Group, in tandem with the European Union
and the Russian Federation, in forging a plan for a compre-
hensive settlement to the Bosnian conflict. In addition, the
U.S., through the Sarajevo airlift and airdrops throughout
Bosnia-Herzegovina, has provided the largest quantity of
humanitarian aid of any nation. We have led the way in
NATO's decisions to enforce the no-fly zone, to protect
UN troops if they are attacked, to enforce the economic
sanctions against Serbia on the Adriatic and, most recently,
to end the Serb’s assault on Gorazde. And we have
deployed peacekeeping troops to the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia to prevent the spillover of the
conflict, as well as laying down a firm warning to Serbia
against escalation of violence in Kosovo.

The murderous conflict in Yugoslavia reminds us that mili-
tary forces remain relevant in a post-Cold War world. It
also reveals the difficulties of applying military force to
conflicts within as well as among states. And it teaches us
that it is best to act early to prevent conflicts that we may
later not be able to control.

21

As we work to resolve that tragedy and ease the suffering
of its victims we also need to change our security institu-
tions so they can better address such conflicts and advance
Europe's integration. Many institutions will play a role,
including the European Union, the Western European
Union, the Council of Europe, the Conference for Security
and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations. But
NATO, history's greatest political-military alliance, must
be central to that process.

Only NATO has the military forces, the integrated
command structure, the broad legitimacy and the habits of
cooperation that are essential to draw in new participants
and respond to new challenges. One of the deepest trans-
formations within the transatlantic community over the
past half-century occurred because the armed forces of our
respective nations trained, studied and marched through
their careers together. It is not only the compatibility of our
weapons, but the camaraderie of our warriors that provide
the sinews behind our mutual security guarantees and our
best hope for peace.

Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has
significantly reduced the level of U.S. military forces
stationed in Europe. We have determined that a force of
roughly 100,000 U.S. military personnel assigned to U.S.
European command will preserve U.S. influence and lead-
ership in NATO and provide a deterrent posture that is
visible to both Western and Eastern Europeans. While we
continue to examine the proper mix of forces, this level of
permanent presence, augmented by forward deployed
naval forces and reinforcements available from the U.S., is
sufficient to respond to plausible crises and contributes to
stability in the region. Such a force level also provides a
sound basis for U.S. participation in multinational training
and preserves the capability to deter or respond to larger
threats in Europe and to support limited NATO operations
“out of area.”

With the end of the Cold War, NATO’s mission is
evolving; today NATO plays a crucial role helping to
manage ethnic and national conflict in Europe. With U.S.
leadership, NATO has provided the muscle that is helping
to bring about a peaceful settlement in the former
Yugoslavia. NATO air power enforces the UN-mandated
no-fly zone and provides support to UN peacekeepers.
Our firm ultimatum in February 1994 finally brought an
end to the shelling of Sarajevo, and NATO’s April decision

22

 

ended the siege of Gorazde. NATO stands ready to help
support the peace once the parties reach an agreement.

With the adoption of the U.S. initiative, Partnership for
Peace, at the January 1994 summit, NATO is playing an
increasingly important role in our strategy of European
integration, extending the scope of our security coopera-
tion to the new democracies of Europe. Twenty-one
nations, including Russia, have already joined the partner-
ship, which will pave the way for a growing program of
military cooperation and political consultation. Partner
countries are sending representatives to NATO headquar-
ters near Brussels and to a military coordination cell at
Mons — the site of SHAPE. Joint exercises will take place
later this year in Poland and the Netherlands.

In keeping with our strategy of enlargement, PFP is open to
all former members of the Warsaw Pact as well as other
European states. Each partner will set the scope and pace
of its cooperation with NATO. During his trip to Europe in
July, the President reaffirmed his commitment to NATO's
future expansion, with PFP the best path toward NATO
membership. The aim of NATO's future expansion,
however, will not be to draw a new line in Europe further
east, but to expand stability, democracy, prosperity and
security cooperation to an ever-broader Europe.

The second element of the new strategy for Europe is
economic. The United States seeks to build on vibrant and
open market economies, the engines that have given us
the greatest prosperity in human history over the last
several decades in Europe and in the United States. To this
end, we strongly support the process of European integra-
tion embodied in the European Union, seek to deepen our
partnership with the EU in support of our economic goals
but also commit ourselves to the encouragement of bilat-
eral trade and investment in countries not part of the EU.

The nations of the European Union face particularly severe
economic challenges with nearly 20 million people unem-
ployed and, in Germany's case, the extraordinarily high
costs of unification. Among the Atlantic nations, economic
stagnation has clearly eroded public support in finances for
outward-looking foreign policies and for greater integra-
tion. We are working closely with our West European part-
ners to expand employment and promote longterm

growth, building on the results of the Detroit Jobs
Conference and the Naples G-7 Summit.

 

 

As we work to strengthen our own economies, we must
know that we serve our own prosperity and our security by
helping the new market reforms in the new democracies in
Europe's East that will help to deflate the region’s dema-
gogues. It will help ease ethnic tensions. It will help new
democracies take root.

In Russia, the economic transformation undertaken will go
down as one of the great historical events of this century.
The Russian Government has made remarkable progress
toward privatizing the economy and reducing inflation.
But much remains to be done to build on the reform
momentum to assure durable economic recovery and
social protection. President Clinton has given strong and
consistent support to this unprecedented reform effort, and
has mobilized the international community to provide
structural economic assistance.

The short-term. difficulties of taking Central and Eastern
Europe into Western economic institutions will be more
than rewarded if they succeed and if they are customers
for America’s and Western Europe's goods and services
tomorrow. That is why this Administration has been
committed to increase support substantially for market
reforms in the new states of the former Soviet Union, and
why we have continued our support for economic transi-
tion in Central and Eastern Europe, while also paying
attention to measures that can overcome the social dislo-
cations which have resulted largely from the collapse of
the Soviet-dominated regional trading system.

Ultimately, the success of market reforms to the East will
depend more on trade than aid. No one nation has
enough money to markedly change the future of those
countries as they move to free market systems. One of our
priorities, therefore, is to reduce trade barriers with the
former communist states.

The third and final imperative of this new strategy is to
support the growth of democracy and individual freedoms
that has begun in Russia, the nations of the former Soviet
Union and Europe's former communist states. The success
of these democratic reforms makes us all more secure;
they are the best answer to the aggressive nationalism and
ethnic hatreds unleashed by the end of the Cold War.
Nowhere is democracy’s success more important to us all
than in these countries.

 

This will be the work of generations. There will be wrong
turns and even reversals, as there have been in all coun-
tries throughout history. But as long as these states
continue their progress toward democracy and respect the
tights of their own and other people, that they understand
the rights of their minorities and their neighbors, we will
support their progress with a steady patience.

East Asia and the Pacific

East Asia is a region of growing importance for U.S. secu-
rity and prosperity; nowhere are the strands of our three-
pronged strategy more intertwined, nor is the need for
continued U.S. engagement more evident. Now more than
ever, security, open markets and democracy go hand in
hand in our approach to this dynamic region. President
Clinton envisions an integrated strategy — a New Pacific
Community — which links security requirements with
economic realities and our concern for democracy and
human rights.

In thinking about Asia, we must remember that security
comes first. The United States intends to remain active in
that region. We are a Pacific nation. We have fought three
wars there in this century. To deter regional aggression and
secure our own interests, we will maintain an active pres-
ence and we will continue to lead. Our deep bilateral ties
with allies such as Japan, South Korea, Australia, Thailand,
and the Philippines, and a continued, committed
American military presence will serve as a bedrock for
America’s security role in the Asia-Pacific region.
Currently, our forces number nearly 100,000 personnel in
this critical region. In addition to performing the general
forward deployment functions outlined above, they
contribute to deterring aggression and adventurism by the
North Korean regime.

As the first pillar of our New Pacific Community, we are
pursuing stronger efforts to combat the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction on the Korean peninsula and
in South Asia. We have instituted new regional dialogues
on the full range of common security challenges. Our goal
is to integrate, not isolate the region’s powers and to find
solutions, short of conflict, to the area’s continuing security
challenges.

23

 

 

The second pillar of our new Pacific Community and the
challenge for the Asian Pacific region in this decade is to
develop multiple new arrangements to meet multiple
threats and opportunities. These arrangements can function
like overlapping plates of armor, individually providing
protection and together covering the full body of our
common security concerns.

Our strong commitment to the region, and our active
engagement are the foundation of our efforts to secure
peace and stability on a nonnuclear Korean peninsula. We
are prepared to engage in broad and thorough discussions
with North Korea to resolve a variety of issues, provided
that the North acts in good faith and while it keeps major
elements of its nuclear program “frozen.” But if North
Korea pursues nuclear weapons development, we will do
what it takes, in concert with allies and friends, to assure
South Korea’s security and maintain international pressure
on the Pyongyang regime. Our long run objective
continues to be a non-nuclear, peacefully reunified Korean
Peninsula.

If security problems persist in Asia, so do new opportuni-
ties for economic progress. Just three decades ago, Asia
had only 8% of the world’s GDP. Today, it exceeds 25%,
Asian economies are growing at three times the rate of the
more established industrial nations.

The growth of Asia can and will benefit our nation. Over
the past five years, our exports to many Asian nations have
increased by 50% or more. Much of what Asia needs to
continue its growth are goods and services in which we
are strong. Already, Asia is our largest trading partner.
Exports to Asia account for 2.5 million jobs.

We are working with Japan to bring about the implemen-
tation of the 1993 Framework Agreement, to ensure that
the economic leg of that relationship is as healthy and
vibrant as our political and security links.

We are developing a broader engagement with the
People’s Republic of China that will encompass both our
economic and strategic interests. That policy is best
reflected in our decision to delink China’s Most Favored
Nation status from its record on human rights. We are also
working to facilitate China’s development of a more open,
market economy that accepts international trade practices.
Given its growing economic potential and already sizable

24

 

military force, it is essential that China not become a secu-
rity threat to the region. To that end, we are strongly
promoting China’s participation in regional security mech-
anisms to reassure its neighbors and assuage its own secu-
rity concerns. And we are seeking to gain further coopera-
tion from China in controlling the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction.

We are also moving to take advantage of evolving multilat-
eral mechanisms. The APEC summit, hosted by President
Clinton last year, is vivid testimony to the possibilities of
stimulating regional economic cooperation.

The third pillar of our policy in building a new Pacific
community is to support the wave of democratic reform
sweeping the region. The new democratic states of Asia
will have our strong support as they move forward to
consolidate and expand democratic reforms.

Some have argued that democracy is somehow unsuited
for Asia or at least for some Asian nations — that human
rights are relative and that they simply mask Western
culturalism and imperialism. These voices are wrong. It is
not Western imperialism, but the aspirations of Asian
peoples themselves that explain the growing number of
democracies and the growing strength of democracy
movements everywhere in Asia. It is an insult to the spirit,
the hopes, and the dreams of the people who live and
struggle in those countries to assert otherwise.

Each nation must find its own form of democracy. But
there is no cultural justification for torture or tyranny. We
refuse to let repression cloak itself in moral relativism, for
democracy and human rights are not occidental yearnings;
they are universal yearnings and universal norms. We will
continue to press for respect for human rights in countries
as diverse as China and Burma.

The Western Hemisphere

The Western hemisphere, too, is a fertile field for a strategy
of engagement and enlargement. Sustained improvements
in the security situation there, including the resolution of
border tensions, control of insurgencies and containment
of pressures for arms proliferation, will be an essential
underpinning of political and economic progress in the
hemisphere.

 

The unprecedented triumph of democracy and market
economies throughout the region offers an unparalleled
opportunity to secure the benefits of peace and stability,
and to promote economic growth and trade. Ratification of
NAFTA is one of our most important foreign policy
achievements, because it advances all three of our central
objectives: not only does it mean new jobs and new
opportunities for American workers and business, but it
also represents an important step in solidifying the hemi-
spheric community of democracies. Vice President Gore
has called NAFTA “a starting point for dealing with the
common challenges of the Americas.”

At the Summit of the Americas this December, President
Clinton will bring together the region’s leaders to explore
new ways to further this process of integration. The
Summit will address three broad themes: promoting
democracy, increasing prosperity and trade ties, and
achieving sustainable development.

At the same time, we remain committed to extending
democracy to the handful of remaining outposts where the
region’s people are not free. Our overarching objective is
to preserve the dominance of civilian elected governments
and promote their evolution into functioning democratic
societies respectful of human rights. In Haiti we are
working with the international community to reverse the
military coup and restore democracy. The Cuban
Democracy Act remains the framework for our policy
toward Cuba; our goal is the peaceful establishment of
democratic governance for the people of Cuba.

We are working with our neighbors through the OAS to
invigorate regional cooperation. Both bilaterally and
regionally, we seek to eliminate the scourge of drug traf-
ficking, which poses a serious threat to democracy and
security. We also seek to strengthen norms for defense
establishments that are supportive of democracy, respect
for human rights, and civilian control in defense matters.
Finally, protecting the region’s precious environmental
resources is an important priority.

The Middle East, Southwest and
South Asia

The United States has enduring interests in the Middle
East, especially pursuing a comprehensive breakthrough to
Middle East peace, assuring the security of Israel and our

 

Arab friends, and maintaining the free flow of oil at
reasonable prices. Our strategy is harnessed to the unique
characteristics of the region and our vital interests there, as
we work to extend the range of peace and stability, while
implementing a strategy of dua! containment of Iraq and
Iran as long as those states pose a threat to U.S. interests,
to other states in the region, and to their own citizens.

We have made solid progress in the past year. The
President's efforts helped bring about an historic first — the
handshake of peace between Prime Minister Rabin and
Chairman Arafat on the White House lawn. The President
will bring Prime Minister Rabin and King Hussein to
Washington for an historic meeting to advance the peace
process further. But our efforts have not stopped there; on
other bilateral tracks and through regional dialogue we are
working to foster a durable peace and a comprehensive
settlement, while our support for economic development
can bring hope to all the peoples of the region.

 

In Southwest Asia, the United States will maintain its long-
standing presence, which has been centered on naval
vessels in and near the Persian Gulf and prepositioned
combat equipment. Since Operation Desert Storm, tempo-
rary deployments of land-based aviation forces, ground
forces and amphibious units have supplemented our
posture in the Gulf region.

While we hold out the hand of cooperation and assistance
to the nations of the region that choose peace, we are firm
in our determination to contain and resist those who foster
conflict. We have instituted a new dual containment
strategy aimed at both Iraq and Iran.

We have made clear to Iraq it must comply with all the
relevant Security Council resolutions, and we continue to
support oppressed minorities in Iraq through Operations
Provide Comfort and Southern Watch. Our policy is
directed not against the people of Iraq, but against its
oppressive and dangerous leaders.

Our policy toward Iran is aimed at changing the behavior
of the Iranian government in several key areas, including
tran’s efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction and
missiles, its support for terrorism and groups that oppose
the peace process, its attempts to undermine friendly
governments in the region and its dismat human rights
record. We remain willing to enter into an authoritative
dialogue with Iran to discuss the differences between us.

25

 

South Asia has seen the spread of democracy, and our
strategy is designed to help the peoples of that region
enjoy the fruits of democracy and greater stability through
efforts aimed at resolving long-standing conflict and imple-
menting confidence building measures. This advances U.S.
interests in halting nuclear and ballistic missile prolifera-
tion. The United States has engaged India and Pakistan in
seeking agreement on steps to cap, reduce, and ultimately
eliminate their weapons of mass destruction and ballistic
missile capabilities. Regional stability and improved bilat-
eral ties are also important for America’s economic interest
in a region that contains a quarter of the world’s popula-
tion and one of its most important emerging markets.

A key objective of our policy in the Gulf is to reduce the
chances that another aggressor will emerge who would
threaten the independence of existing states. Therefore, we
will continue to encourage members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council to work closely on collective defense
and security arrangements, help individual GCC states
meet their appropriate defense requirements and maintain
our bilateral defense agreements.

In both the Middle East and South Asia, the pressure of
expanding populations on natural resources is enormous.
Growing desertification in the Middle East has strained
relations over arable land. Pollution of the coastal areas in
the Eastern Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Gulf of
Aqaba has degraded fish catches and hindered develop-
ment. Water shortages stemming from overuse, contami-
nated water aquifers, and riparian disputes threaten
regional relations.

In South Asia, high population densities and rampant
pollution have exacted a tremendous toll on forests, biodi-
versity, and the local environment.

Africa

Africa is one of our greatest challenges for a strategy of
engagement and enlargement. Throughout Africa, the U.S.
policy seeks to help support democracy, sustainable
economic development and resolution of conflicts through
negotiation, diplomacy and peacekeeping. New policies
will focus on efforts to strengthen civil societies and mech-
anisms for conflict resolution, particularly where ethnic,
religious, and political tensions are acute. In particular, we

26

 

intend to focus on identifying and addressing the root
causes of conflicts and disasters before they erupt.

The nexus of economic, political, social, ethnic and envi-
ronmental challenges facing Africa can lead to a sense of
“Afro-pessimism.” We will instead seek to simultaneously
address these challenges and create a synergy that can
stimulate development, resurrect societies and build hope.
Throughout the continent — in Rwanda, Burundi,
Mozambique, Angola, Liberia, Sudan.and elsewhere —
we encourage peaceful resolution of internal disputes to
promote long-term stability and development of the
region. We also encourage democratic reform in nations
tike Nigeria and Zaire to allow the people of these coun-
tries to enjoy responsive government.

This year, South Africa took key steps towards democratic
reform with the holding of non-racial elections and
creation of a Government of National Unity. We will
remain committed to ensuring that democracy takes root
in South Africa in order to foster a new era of prosperity
and stability for al! the peoples of the region. We must
support the revolution of democracy sweeping the conti-
nent — on center stage in South Africa, and in quieter but
no less dramatic ways in countries like Malawi, Benin,
Niger and Mali. We need to encourage the creation of
cultures of tolerance, flowering of civil society and the
protection of human rights and human dignity.

Our humanitarian interventions, along with the interna-
tional community, will require continued active participa-
tion to address the grave circumstances on the continent.
This has been particularly true in Somalia. The global
reach of U.S. forces in Somalia allowed us to break
through the chaos that had prevented the introduction of
relief supplies and UN peacekeepers. U.S. forces
prevented the death of hundreds of thousands of Somalis,
established a logistics system and then turned over the
mission to more than 25,000 UN peacekeepers from over
a score of nations.

In the end, however, such efforts by the U.S. and the inter-
national community must be limited in duration and
designed to give the peoples of a nation the means and
opportunity to put their own house in order. In Somalia
and elsewhere, the responsibility for the fate of a nation
rests finally with its own people. In Rwanda, the United
States has also taken an active role in providing relief to
those displaced by ethnic violence. And U.S. AID is

 

 

 

leading international efforts to get ahead of the curve on
potential famines that threaten up to 20 million people on
the continent.

The United States is also working with regional organiza-
tions, non-governmental organizations and governments
throughout Africa to address the urgent issues of popula-
tion growth, spreading disease (including AIDS), environ-
mental decline, enhancing the role of women in develop-
ment, eliminating support for terrorism, demobilization of
bloated militaries, relieving burdensome debt, and
expanding trade and investment ties to the countries of
Africa.

Central to all these efforts will be strengthening the
American constituency for Africa, drawing on the knowl-
edge, experience and commitment of millions of

 

Americans to enhance our nation’s support for positive
change in Africa. The White House Conference on Africa,
the first such gathering of regional experts ever sponsored
by the White House, drew together more than 200
Americans from the Administration, Congress, business,
labor, academia, religious groups, relief and development
agencies, human rights groups and others to discuss
Africa’s future and the role that the United States can play
in it. The President, Vice President, Secretary of State and
National Security Advisor all participated in the confer-
ence, which produced a wealth of new ideas and new
commitment to Africa.

IV. Conclusions

The clear and present dangers of the Cold War made the
need for national security commitments and expenditures
obvious to the American people. Today the task of mobi-
lizing public support for national security priorities has
become more complicated. The complex array of new
dangers, opportunities and responsibilities outlined in this
strategy come at a moment in our history when Americans
are preoccupied with domestic concerns and when
budgetary constraints are tighter than at any point in the
last half century. Yet, in an integrating and interdependent
world, we simply cannot be successful in advancing our
interests — political, military and economic — without
active engagement in world affairs.

While Cold War threats have diminished, our nation can
never again isolate itself from global developments.
Domestic renewal will not succeed if we fail to engage
abroad in open foreign markets, to promote democracy in
key countries, and to counter and contain emerging
threats.

 

We are committed to enhancing U.S. national security in
the most efficient and effective ways possible. We recog-
nize that maintaining peace and ensuring our national
security in a volatile world are expensive. The cost of any
other course of action, however, would. be immeasurably
higher.

Our engagement abroad requires the active, sustained
bipartisan support of the American people and the U.S.
Congress. Of all the elements contained in this strategy,
none is more important than this: our Administration is
committed to explaining our security interests and objec- .
tives to the nation; to seeking the broadest possible public
and congressional support for our security programs and
investments; and to exerting our leadership in the world in
a manner that reflects our best national values and protects
the security of this great and good nation.

PREFACE

Protecting our nation's security — our
people, our territory and our way of
life — is my Administration's foremost
mission and constitutional duty. The
end of the Cold war fundamentally
changed America's security imperatives.
The central security challenge of the
past half century — the threat of
communist expansion — is gone. The
dangers we face today are more diverse.
Ethnic conflict is spreading and rogue
states pose a serious danger to
regional stability in many corners of
the globe. The proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction represents
a major challenge to our security.
Large scale environmental degradation,
exacerbated by rapid population growth,
threatens to undermine political
stability in many countries and
regions.

At the same time, we have unparalleled
opportunities to make our nation safer
and more prosperous. Our military
might is unparalleled. We now have a
truly global economy linked by an
instantaneous communications network,
which offers growing opportunity for
American jobs and American investment.
The community of democratic nations is
growing, enhancing the prospects for
political stability, peaceful conflict
resolution and greater dignity and hope
for the people of the world. The
international community is beginning to
act together to address pressing global
environmental needs.

Never has American leadership been more
essential — to navigate the shoals of
the world's new dangers and to
capitalize on its opportunities.
American assets are unique: our
military strength, our dynamic economy,
our powerful ideals and, above all, our
people. We can and must make the
difference through our engagement; but
our involvement must be carefully
tailored to serve our interests and
priorities.

This report, submitted in accordance
with Section 603 of the Goldwater -
Nichols Defense Department
Reorganization Act of 1986, elaborates
a national security strategy tailored
for this new era. Focusing on new
threats and new opportunities, its
central goals are:

o To sustain our security with
military forces that are ready to
fight.

© To bolster America's economic
revitalization.

© To promote democracy abroad.

Over the past two years, my
Administration has worked diligently to
pursue these goals. This national
security strategy report presents the
strategy that has guided this effort.
It is premised on a belief that the
line between our domestic and foreign
policies is disappearing — that we must
revitalize our economy if we are to
sustain our military forces, foreign
initiatives and global influence, and
that we must engage actively abroad if
we are to open foreign markets and
create jobs for our people.

We believe that our goals of enhancing
our security, bolstering our economic
prosperity, and promoting democracy are
mutually supportive. Secure nations
are more likely to support free trade
and maintain democratic structures.
Nations with growing economies and
strong trade ties are more likely to
feel secure and to work toward freedom.
And democratic states are less likely
to threaten our interests and more
likely to cooperate with the U.S. to
meet security threats and promote free
trade and sustainable development.

Since my Administration began, we have been
deeply engaged in adapting existing
structures, and in constructing new ones, to
meet these goals. To enhance global
security, for example, we have pursued peace
initiatives in the Middle East; established
NATO's Partnership for Peace and initiated a
process that will lead to NATO's expansion;
secured the accession of Ukraine,
Kazakhstan, and Belarus to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and their agreement
to eliminate nuclear weapons from their
territory, which in turn opened the door to
the ratification and entry into force of the
START I Treaty; participated in an
unprecedented regional security gathering of
the ASEAN countries and others, including
Russia and Vietnam; and reached an agreed
framework with North Korea that halted, and
will eventually eliminate, its dangerous
nuclear program. To bolster prosperity at
home and around the world, we have secured
the enactment of legislation implementing
both the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) and the Uruguay Round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),
worked to open Asian-Pacific markets through
two leaders meetings of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum, lowered export
controls and held a Western Hemisphere
Summit in Miami where the 34 democratic
nations of this hemisphere committed
themselves to negotiate a free trade
agreement by 2005. To promote democracy, we
have supported South Africa's recent
transformation, provided aid to a new
democratic Russia and other new independent
states as well as Central and Eastern
European nations, assisted Cambodia, and
worked with our Western Hemisphere neighbors
restoring the democratically elected
government in Haiti and hosting the Summit
of the Americas, which reaffirmed and
strengthened our mutual commitment to
democracy.

Our extraordinary diplomatic leverage to
reshape existing security and economic
structures and create new ones ultimately
relies upon American power. Our economic
and military might, as well as the power of
our ideals, make America's diplomats the
first among equals. Our economic strength
gives us a position of advantage on almost
every global issue. For instance, South
Africa and our negotiations with North Korea
demonstrate how economic incentives and the
imposition — or the threat — of economic
sanctions enable us to achieve our
objectives as part of our determined
diplomacy.

But military force remains an indispensable

element of our nation's power. Even with
the Cold War over, our nation must maintain

ii

military forces sufficient to deter diverse
threats and, when necessary, to fight and
win against our adversaries. While many
factors ultimately contribute to our
nation's safety and well-being, no single
component is more important than the men and
women who wear America's uniform and stand
sentry over our security. Their skill,
service and dedication constitute the core
of our defenses. Today our military is the
best-equipped, best trained and
best-prepared fighting force in the world.
Time after time in the last year, our troops
demonstrated their current readiness and
strength: helping to save hundreds of
thousands of lives in Rwanda; moving with
lightning speed to head off another Iraqi
threat to Kuwait; and giving freedom and
democracy back to the people of Haiti. I am
committed to ensuring that this military
capability is not compromised.

The United States recognizes that we have a
special responsibility that goes along with
being a great power. Our global interests
and our historic ideals impel us to oppose
those who would endanger the survival or
well- being of their peaceful neighbors.
Nations should be able to expect that their
borders and their sovereignty will always be
secure. At the same time, this does not
mean we or the international community must
tolerate gross violations of human rights
within those borders.

When our national security interests are
threatened, we will, as America always has
use diplomacy when we can, but force if we
must. We will act with others when we can
but alone when we must. We recognize,
however, that while force can defeat an
aggressor, it cannot solve underlying
problems. Democracy and economic prosperity
can take root in a struggling society only
through local solutions carried out by the
society itself. We must use military force
selectively, recognizing that its use may do
no more than provide a window of opportunity
for a society — and diplomacy — to work.

We therefore will send American troops
abroad only when our interests and our
values are sufficiently at stake. When we
do so, it will be with clear objectives to
which we are firmly committed and which —
when combat is likely — we have the means to
achieve decisively. To do otherwise, risks
those objectives and endangers our troops.
These requirements are as pertinent for
humanitarian and other non-traditional
interventions today as they were for
previous generations during prolonged world
wars. Modern media communications may now
bring to our homes both the suffering that
exists in many parts of the world and the
casualties that may accompany interven-

tion to help. But we must remain clear
in our purpose and resolute in its
execution. And while we must continue
to reassess the costs and benefits of
any operation as it unfolds, reflexive
calls for withdrawal of our forces when
casualties are incurred would simply
encourage rogue actors to try to force
our departure from areas where there
are U.S. interests by attacking
American troops.

During the past two years, diplomacy
backed by American power has produced
results:

O When Iraq moved forces towards Kuwait
we reacted swiftly and dispatched
large-scale forces to the region under
the authority of the United Nations—but
were prepared to act alone, if
necessary.

o In Haiti, it was only when the Haitian
military learned that the 82nd Airborne
Division was enroute that we achieved
peacefully what we were prepared to do
under fire.

o In Bosnia, we have been able to achieve
limited but important objectives when
diplomacy has been married to
appropriate military power. For
instance, the Sarajevo ultimatum largely
succeeded because the threat of NATO air
power was judged real; similarly, the
threat of NATO airpower prevented the
fall of Gorazde.

o In Rwanda and Somalia, only the American
military could have done what it did in
these humanitarian missions, saving
hundreds of thousands of lives.
However, over the longer run our
interests were served by turning these
operations over to multilateral
peacekeeping forces once the immediate
humanitarian crisis was addressed. No
outside force can create a stable and
legitimate domestic order for another
society—that work can only be
accomplished by the society itself.

Our national security strategy reflects
both America's interests and our
values. Our commitment to freedom,
equality and human dignity continues to
serve as a beacon of hope to peoples
around the world. The vitality,
creativity and diversity of American

society are important sources of
national strength in a global economy
increasingly driven by information and
ideas.

Our prospects in this new era are
promising. The specter of nuclear
annihilation has dramatically receded.
The historic events of the past two
years — including the hand shake
between Israel and the PLO, the peace
treaty between Israel and Jordan, and
the transformation of South Africa to a
multiracial democracy headed by
President Mandela — suggest this era's
possibilities for achieving security,
prosperity and democracy.

Our nation can only address this era's
dangers and opportunities if we remain
actively engaged in global affairs. We
are the world's greatest power, and we
have global interests as well as
responsibilities. As our nation
learned after World War I, we can find
no security for America in isolationism
nor prosperity in protectionism. For
the American people to be safer and
enjoy expanding opportunities, our
nation must work to deter would-be
aggressors, open foreign markets,
promote the spread of democracy abroad,
encourage sustainable development and
pursue new opportunities for peace.

Our national security requires the
patient application of American will
and resources. We can only sustain
that necessary investment with the
broad, bipartisan support of the
American people and their
representatives in Congress. The full
participation of Congress is essential
to the success of our new engagement,
and I will consult with members of
Congress at every step in making and
implementing American foreign policy.
The Cold War may be over, but the need
for American leadership abroad remains
as strong as ever. I am committed to
forging a new public consensus to
sustain our active engagement abroad in
pursuit of our cherished goal — a more
secure world where democracy and free
markets know no borders. This document
details that commitment.

I. INTRODUCTION

A new era is upon us. The Cold War is
over. The dissolution of the Soviet
empire has radically transformed the
security environment facing the United
States and our allies. The primary
security imperative of the past half
century — containing communist
expansion while preventing nuclear war
— is gone. We no longer face massive
Soviet forces across an East-West
divide nor Soviet missiles targeted on
the United States. Yet there remains a
complex array of new and old security
challenges America must meet as we
approach a new century.

This national security strategy
assesses America's role in this new
international context and describes the
Administration's strategy to advance
our interests at home and abroad.

This is a period of great promise but
also great uncertainty. We stand as
the world's preeminent power.

America's core value of freedom, as
embodied in democratic governance and
market economics, has gained ground
around the world. Hundreds of millions
of people have thrown off communism,
dictatorship or apartheid. Former
adversaries now cooperate with us in
diplomacy and global problem solving.
Both the threat of a war among great
powers and the specter of nuclear
annihilation have receded dramatically.
The dynamism of the global economy is
transforming commerce, culture and
global politics, promising greater
prosperity for America and greater
cooperation among nations.

At the same time, troubling
uncertainties and clear threats remain.
The new, independent states that
replaced the

Soviet Union are experiencing wrenching
economic and political transitions, as
are many new democracies of Central and
Eastern Europe. While our relations
with the other great powers are as
constructive as at any point in this
century, Russia's historic transfor-
mation will proceed along a difficult
path, and China maintains a repressive
regime even as that country assumes a
more important economic and political
role in global affairs. The spread of
weapons of mass destruction poses
serious threats. Violent extremists
threaten fragile peace processes in
many parts of the world. Worldwide,
there is a resurgence of militant
nationalism as well as ethnic and
religious conflict. This has been
demonstrated by upheavals in Bosnia,
Rwanda and Somalia, where the United
States has participated in peacekeeping
and humanitarian missions.

Not all security risks are immediate or
military in nature. Transnational
phenomena such as terrorism, narcotics
trafficking, environmental degradation,
natural resource depletion, rapid
population growth and refugee flows
also have security implications for
both present and long term American
policy. In addition, an emerging class
of transnational environmental issues
are increasingly affecting interna-
tional stability and consequently will
present new challenges to U.S. strategy.

American leadership in the world has
never been more important, for there is
a simple truth about this new world:
the same idea that was under attack
three times in this Century — first by
imperialism and then by fascism and
communism — remains under attack today,
but on many

fronts at once. It is an idea that comes
under many names — democracy, liberty,
civility, pluralism — but which together are
the values of a society where leaders and
governments preserve individual freedoms

and ensure opportunity and human dignity.

As the President has said, ""We face a
contest as old as history — a struggle
between freedom and tyranny; between
tolerance and isolation. It is a fight
between those who would build free societies
governed by laws and those who would impose
their will by force. Our struggle today, in
a world more high-tech, more fast-moving,
more chaotically diverse than ever, is the
age-old fight between hope and fear.""

The victors of World War I squandered their
triumph in this age-old struggle when they
turned inward, bringing on a global
depression and allowing fascism to rise, and
reigniting global war. After World war II,
we learned the lessons of the past. In the
face of a new totalitarian threat this great
nation did not walk away from the challenge
of the moment. Instead it chose to reach
out, to rebuild international security
structures and to lead. This determination
of previous generations to prevail over
communism by shaping new international
structures left us a world stronger, safer
and freer. It is this example and its
success which now inspire us to begin the
difficult task of a new stage in this old
struggle: to secure the peace won in the
Cold War against those who would still deny
people their human rights, terrorists who
threaten innocents and pariah states who
choose repression and extremism over
openness and moderation.

If we exert our leadership abroad, we can
make America safer and more prosperous — by
deterring aggression, by fostering the
peaceful resolution of dangerous conflicts
by opening foreign markets, by helping
democratic regimes and by tackling global
problems. Without our active leadership and
engagement abroad, threats will fester and
our opportunities will narrow.

We must seek to be as creative and
constructive — in the literal sense of that
word — as the generation of the late 1940's.
For all its dangers, this new world presents
an immense opportunity — the chance to adapt
and construct global institutions that will
help to provide security and increase
economic growth throughout the world.

The issue for the next decade is whether our
efforts at this construction can succeed in
the face of shifting threats to the ideals
and habits of democracy. It is therefore in
our

interest that democracy be at once the
foundation and the purpose of the
international structures we build through
this constructive diplomacy: the foundation
because the institutions will be a
reflection of their shared values and norms;
the purpose, because if our economic
institutions are secure, democracy will
flourish.

While democracy will not soon take hold
everywhere, we know that the larger the pool
of democracies, the better off we, and the
entire community of nations, will be.
Democracies create free markets that offer
economic opportunity, make for more reliable
trading partners, and are far less likely to
wage war on one another. It is in our
interest to do all that we can to enlarge
the community of free and open societies
especially in areas of greatest strategic
interest, as in the former Soviet Union.

We can only engage actively abroad if the
American people and the Congress are willing
to bear the costs of that leadership — in
dollars, political energy and, at times
American lives. In a democracy, the foreign
policy of the nation must serve the needs of
the people. The preamble of the
Constitution sets out the basic objectives:

to provide for the common defense,
promote the general welfare, and secure
the blessings of liberty to ourselves
and our posterity.

The end of the Cold War does not alter these
fundamental purposes. Nor does it reduce
the need for active American efforts, here
and abroad, to pursue those goals. One
purpose of this report is to help foster the
broad, bipartisan understanding and support
necessary to sustain our international
engagement. A coalition of the center
through bipartisan congressional
participation is critical to this
commitment.

Our national security strategy is based on
enlarging the community of market
democracies while deterring and containing a
range of threats to our nation, our allies
and our interests. The more that democracy
and political and economic liberalization
take hold in the world, particularly in
countries of geostrategic importance to us
the safer our nation is likely to be and the
more our people are likely to prosper.

To that broad end, the report explains the
three central components of our strategy of
engagement and enlargement: our efforts to
enhance our security by maintaining a

strong defense capability and promoting
cooperative security measures; our work to
open foreign markets and spur global
economic growth; and our promotion of
democracy abroad. It also explains how we
are pursuing the three elements of our
strategy in specific regions by adapting and
constructing institutions that will help to
provide security and increase economic
growth throughout the world.

During the first two years of this
Administration, this strategy already has
produced tangible results with respect to
our security requirements:

oO

At the President's direction, the
Pentagon completed the Bottom Up Review,
a full-scale assessment of what defense
forces and systems our nation needs for
this new security era. The President
has also set forth a defense budget for
Fiscal Years 1996-2001 that funds the
force structure recommended by the
Review, and he repeatedly stressed that
he will draw the line against further
cuts that would undermine that force
structure or erode U.S. military
readiness. The swift and efficient
deployment of our forces last October to
the Persian Gulf, and to Haiti and
Rwanda, clearly demonstrates their
continued readiness to respond as
needed. The President also requested
Congress to enact supplemental appro-
priations of $1.7 billion for FY 1994
and $2.6 billion for FY 1995 to ensure
training readiness is not impaired by
the costs of such unanticipated contin-
gencies. In addition, the President
added $25 billion to the defense
spending plan over the next six years to
provide more funding for readiness and
to improve the quality of life of our
military personnel and families.

At President Clinton's initiative, a
NATO Summit in January 1994 approved the
Partnership For Peace (PFP) and
initiated a process that will lead to
NATO's gradual expansion to ensure that
NATO is prepared to meet the European
and trans-Atlantic security challenges
of this era, and to provide the security
relationships that will provide the
underpinnings for the democratic gains
in Europe since 1989. Since the Summit,
25 countries, including Russia, agreed
to join the Partnership for Peace.

The United States, Russia, Ukraine,
Belarus and Kazakhstan exchanged
instruments of ratification for the
START I Treaty at the December summit of
the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe

(CSCE), culminating two years of inten-
sive U.S. diplomatic efforts to bring
the Treaty into force and paving the way
for ratification of the START II Treaty.
START I requires the permanent elimi-
nation of bombers, ICBM silos and bal-
listic missile submarine launch tubes
that carried over 9,000 of the 21,000
total warheads the United States and the
former Soviet Union declared when the
Treaty was signed — a reduction of 40
percent. START II, signed in 1993, will
eliminate additional U.S. and Russian
strategic launchers and will effectively
remove an additional 5,000 warheads,
leaving each side with no more than
3,500. These actions will reduce the
strategic force arsenals of the United
States and Russia by two-thirds. Pre-
sidents Clinton and Yeltsin have agreed
that once START II is ratified, the
United States and Russia will begin
immediately to deactivate all strategic
nuclear delivery systems to be reduced
under the Treaty by removing their
nuclear warheads or taking other steps
to take them out of combat status, thus
removing thousands of warheads from
alert status years ahead of schedule.
The two Presidents also directed an
intensification of dialogue regarding
the possibility of further reductions
of, and limitations on, remaining
nuclear forces.

The President launched a comprehensive
policy to combat the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and the
missiles that deliver them. The United
States has secured landmark commitments
to eliminate all nuclear weapons from
Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan and, in
December, all three nations formally
acceded to the Nuclear Non-proliferation
Treaty as non-nuclear weapon states.
The United States and over 30 other
nations opened formal negotiations ona
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in January
1994, producing a Joint Draft Treaty
text that provides a baseline for
resolving remaining issues. We also
made significant progress during the
past year in negotiations within the
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty's
Standing Consultative Commission (SCC)
to establish an agreed demarcation
between strategic and theater ballistic
missiles that will allow for the
deployment of advanced theater missile
defense and update the ABM treaty to
reflect the break-up of the Soviet
Union. The Administration also sub-
mitted the Chemical Weapons Convention
to the Senate for ratification and
supported the development of new
measures to strengthen the Biological
Weapons Convention.

The Administration reached an important
agreed framework with North Korea that
has halted, and will eventually
eliminate, that country's nuclear
program, greatly enhancing regional
stability and achieving our
nonproliferation goals. The
Administration also reached agreements
with Russia, Ukraine and South Africa to
control missile-related technology and
secured China's commitment not to
transfer MTCR-controlled
ground-to-ground missiles.

The President's efforts helped bring
about many historic firsts in the Middle
East peace process — the handshake of
peace between Prime Minister Rabin and
Chairman Arafat on the White House lawn
has been followed by the Jordan-Israel
peace treaty, progress on eliminating
the Arab boycott of Israel and the
establishment of ties between Israel and
an increasing number of its Arab
neighbors.

On May 3, 1994, President Clinton signed
a Presidential Decision Directive
establishing ""U.S. Policy on Reforming
Multilateral Peace Operations."" This
policy represents the first,
comprehensive framework for U.S.
decisionmaking on issues of peacekeeping
and peace enforcement suited to the
realities of the post Cold War period.

In October 1994, President Clinton
submitted the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea to the Senate for
ratification. This was the culmination
of years of negotiations to ensure an
equitable balance between the rights of
coastal states to control activities in
adjacent offshore areas to protect their
economic, security and environmental
interests, and the rights of maritime
states to free and unimpeded navigation
and overflight of the oceans of the
world. This included an acceptable
regime to administer the mineral
resources of the deep seabed, thereby
protecting U.S. interests.

 

On the economic front, Administration
policies have created nearly six million
American jobs and established the foundation
for the global economy of the 21st Century:

oO

The President worked with the Congress
on effective measures to reduce the
federal budget deficit and restore
economic growth. These measures help
increase our competitiveness and
strengthen our position in negotiations
with other nations.

The President secured approval of the
North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) which creates the world's
largest free trade zone and has already
created more than 100,000 American jobs.
The vote for NAFTA marked a decisive
U.S. affirmation of its international
engagement. Through NAFTA's
environmental and labor side agreements
we are working actively to protect the
rights of workers and to reduce air and
water pollution that crosses national
boundaries. When Mexico came under
short-term financial pressures in
December of 1994, the United States took
the lead in marshaling international
support to assist the country in meeting
this challenge. This decision reflected
the President's belief that the United
States has a strong interest in
prosperity and stability in Mexico and
that it is in our economic and strategic
interest that Mexico's economic reform
program succeeds.

The Administration stood at the
forefront of a multilateral effort to
achieve history's most extensive
market-opening agreements in the GATT
Uruguay-round negotiations on world
trade. Working with a bipartisan
coalition in the Congress, the President
secured approval of this path breaking
agreement and the resulting World Trade
Organization, which will add $100-200
billion and hundreds of thousands of
jobs each year to the U.S. economy.

The President convened the first meeting
of leaders of the Asia- Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum — and took
steps to expand our ties with the
economies of the Asia-Pacific region,
the fastest growing area in the world.
At their second meeting in November
1994, the APEC leaders agreed to the
goal of free trade within the region by
early in the 21st Century and to develop
a blueprint for implementation by the
APEC meeting this year in Osaka.

The President hosted the Summit of the
Americas in December, a historic
gathering where the 34 democratic
nations of the hemisphere committed
themselves to completing negotiations on
a regional free trade agreement by 2005.
In Miami, the United States, Canada and
Mexico also invited Chile to begin
negotiations to join NAFTA.

We have committed the United States to
reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to
1990 levels by the year

2000, and we have developed a National
Climate Plan to achieve that goal. The
United States has also taken a leading
role at the international level towards
phasing out the production of most
ozone-depleting substances. Under the
Montreal Protocol for the protection of
the ozone layer, the United States is
contributing to developing countries'
efforts to reduce their emissions of
ozone-depleting chemicals. In June
1993, the U.S. signed the Biodiversity
Treaty, and one year later, the
Desertification Convention.

The Administration has asserted world
leadership on population issues. We
played a key role during the Cairo
Conference on Population and Development
in developing a consensus Program of
Action, including increased availability
of voluntary family planning and
reproductive health services

sustainable economic development,
strengthening of family ties, the
empowerment of women including enhanced
educational opportunities, anda
reduction in infant and child mortality
through immunizations and other
programs.

Finally, the President has demonstrated a
firm commitment to expanding the global
realm of democracy:

oO

The Administration substantially
expanded U.S. support for democratic and
market reform in Russia, Ukraine and the
other newly independent states of the
former Soviet Union, including a
comprehensive assistance package for
Ukraine.

The United States launched a series of
initiatives to bolster the new
democracies of Central and Eastern
Europe, including the White House Trade
and Investment Conference for Central
and Eastern Europe held in Cleveland in
January. We affirmed our concern for
their security and market economic
transformation, recognizing that such
assurances would play a key role in
promoting democratic developments.

Working with the international community
under the auspices of the UN, we
succeeded in reversing the coup in Haiti
and restoring the democratically elected
president and government. We are now
helping the Haitian people consolidate
their hardwon democracy and rebuild
their country as we complete the
transition from the Multinational Force
to the United Nations Mission in Haiti.

o U.S. engagement in Northern Ireland
contributed to the establishment of a
cease-fire, first by the IRA and
subsequently by loyalist
para-militaries. The President
announced in November a package of
initiatives aimed at consolidating the
peace by promoting economic
revitalization and increased private
sector trade and investment in Northern
Ireland.

o At the Summit of the Americas, the 34
democratic nations of the hemisphere
agreed to a detailed plan of cooperative
action in such diverse fields as health
education, counter-narcotics
environmental protection, information
infrastructure, and the strengthening
and safeguarding of democratic
institutions, in addition to mutual
prosperity and sustainable development.
The Summit ushered in a new era of
hemispheric cooperation that would not
have been possible without U.S.
leadership and commitment.

o The United States has increased support
for South Africa as it conducted
elections and became a multiracial
democracy. During the state visit of
Nelson Mandela in October, we announced
formation of a bilateral commission to
foster new cooperation between our
nations, and an assistance package to
support housing, health, education,
trade and investment.

o The United States, working with the
Organization of American States, helped
reverse an anti-democratic coup in
Guatemala.

o In Mozambique and Angola, the United
States played a leading role in
galvanizing the international community
to help bring an end to two decades of
civil war and to promote national
reconciliation. For the first time,
there is the prospect that all of
southern Africa will enjoy the fruits of
peace and prosperity.

o The Administration initiated policies
aimed at crisis prevention, including a
new peacekeeping policy.

This report has two major sections. The
first part of the report explains our
strategy of engagement and enlargement. The
second part describes briefly how the
Administration is applying this strategy to
the world's major regions.


II. ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS THROUGH

ENGAGEMENT AND ENLARGEMENT

The dawn of the post-Cold War era presents
the United States with many distinct
dangers, but also with a generally improved
security environment and a range of
opportunities to improve it further. The
unitary threat that dominated our engagement
during the Cold war has been replaced by a
complex set of challenges. Our nation's
strategy for defining and addressing those
challenges has several core principles which
guide our policy. First and foremost, we
must exercise global leadership. We are not
the world's policeman, but as the world's
premier economic and military power, and
with the strength of our democratic values
the U.S. is indispensable to the forging of
stable political relations and open trade.

Our leadership must stress preventive
diplomacy — through such means as support
for democracy, economic assistance, overseas
military presence, military-to-military
contacts and involvement in multilateral
negotiations in the Middle East and
elsewhere — in order to help resolve
problems, reduce tensions and defuse
conflicts before they become crises. These
measures are a wise investment in our
national security because they offer the
prospect of resolving problems with the
least human and material cost.

Our engagement must be selective, focusing
on the challenges that are most relevant to
our own interests and focusing our resources
where we can make the most difference. We
must also use the right tools — being
willing to act unilaterally when our direct
national interests are most at stake; in
alliance and partnership when our interests
are shared by others; and multilaterally
when our interests are more general and the
problems are best addressed by the
international community. In all cases, the
nature of our response must depend on what
best serves our own long-term national
interests. Those interests are

ultimately defined by our security
requirements. Such requirements start with
our physical defense and economic
well-being. They also include environmental
security as well as the security of values
achieved through expansion of the community
of democratic nations.

Our national security strategy draws upon a
range of political, military and economic
instruments, and focuses on the primary
objectives that President Clinton has
stressed throughout his Administration:

o Enhancing Our Security. Taking account
of the realities of the post-Cold war
era and the new threats, a military
capability appropriately sized and
postured to meet the diverse needs of
our strategy, including the ability, in
concert with regional allies, to win two
nearly simultaneous major regional
conflicts. We will continue to pursue
arms control agreements to reduce the
danger of nuclear, chemical, biological
and conventional conflict and to promote
stability.

oO Promoting Prosperity at Home. A
vigorous and integrated economic policy
designed to stimulate global
environmentally sound economic growth
and free trade and to press for open and
equal U.S. access to foreign markets.

Oo Promoting Democracy. A framework of
democratic enlargement that increases
our security by protecting,
consolidating and enlarging the
community of free market democracies.
Our efforts focus on strengthening
democratic processes in key emerging
democratic states including Russia,
Ukraine and other new states of the
former Soviet Union.

These basic objectives of our national
security strategy will guide the allocation
of our scarce national security resources.
Because deficit reduction is also central to
the long-term health and competitiveness of
the American economy, we have made it, along
with efficient and environmentally sound use
of our resources, a major priority. Under
the Clinton economic plan, the deficit will
be reduced over 700 billion dollars by
Fiscal Year 1998. President Clinton has
also lowered the deficit as a percentage of
the Gross Domestic Product from 4.9 percent
in Fiscal Year 1992 to 2.4 percent in Fiscal
Year 1995-the lowest since 1979.

Enhancing our Security

The U.S. government is responsible for
protecting the lives and personal safety of
Americans, maintaining our political freedom
and independence as a nation and promoting
the well-being and prosperity of our nation.
No matter how powerful we are as a nation,
we cannot secure these basic goals
unilaterally. Whether the problem is
nuclear proliferation, regional instability,
the reversal of reform in the former Soviet
empire or unfair trade practices, the
threats and challenges we face demand
cooperative, multinational solutions.
Therefore, the only responsible U.S.
strategy is one that seeks to ensure U.S.
influence over and participation in
collective decisionmaking in a wide and
growing range of circumstances.

An important element of our security
preparedness depends on durable
relationships with allies and other friendly
nations. Accordingly, a central thrust of
our strategy of engagement is to sustain and
adapt the security relationships we have
with key nations around the world. These
ties constitute an important part of an
international framework that will be
essential to ensuring cooperation across a
broad range of issues. Within the realm of
security issues, our cooperation with allies
includes such activities as: conducting
combined training and exercises

coordinating military plans and
preparations, sharing intelligence, jointly
developing new systems and controlling
exports of sensitive technologies according
to common standards.

The post-Cold War era presents a different
set of threats to our security. In this new
period, enhancing American security
requires, first and foremost, developing and
maintaining a strong defense capability of
forces ready to fight.

We are developing integrated approaches for
dealing with threats arising from the
development of nuclear and other weapons of
mass destruction by other nations. Our
security requires a vigorous arms control
effort and a strong intelligence capability.
We have implemented a strategy for
multilateral peace operations. We have
clarified rigorous guidelines for when and
how to use military force in this era.

We also face security risks that are not
solely military in nature. Transnational
phenomena such as terrorism, narcotics
trafficking, and refugee flows also have
security implications both for present and
long term American policy. An emerging
class of transnational environmental and
natural resource issues is increasingly
affecting international stability and
consequently will present new challenges to
U.S. strategy. The threat of intrusions to
our military and commercial information
systems poses a significant risk to national
security and must be addressed.

Maintaining a Strong Defense
Capability

U.S. military capabilities are critical to
the success of our strategy. This nation
has unparalleled military capabilities: the
United States is the only nation capable of
conducting large-scale and effective
military operations far beyond its borders.
This fact, coupled with our unique position
as the security partner of choice in many
regions, provides a foundation for regional
stability through mutually beneficial
security partnerships. Our willingness and
ability to play a leading role in defending
common interests also help ensure that the
United States will remain an influential
voice in international affairs — political
military and economic — that affect our
well-being, so long as we retain the
military wherewithal to underwrite our
commitments credibly.

To protect and advance U.S. interests in the
face of the dangers and opportunities
outlined earlier, the United States must
deploy robust and flexible military forces
that can accomplish a variety of tasks:

o Deterring and Defeating Aggression in
Major Regional Conflicts. Our forces
must be able to help offset the military
power of regional states with interests
opposed to those of the United States
and its allies. To do this, we must be
able to credibly deter and defeat
aggression, by projecting and sustaining
U.S. power in more than one region if
necessary.

o Providing a Credible Overseas Presence.
U.S. forces must also be forward
deployed or stationed in key overseas
regions in peacetime to deter aggression
and advance U.S. strategic interests.
Such overseas presence demonstrates our
commitment to allies and friends,
underwrites regional stability, gains us
familiarity with overseas operating
environments, promotes combined training
among the forces of friendly countries
and provides timely initial response
capabilities.

oO Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction.
We are devoting greater efforts to
stemming the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and their delivery
means, but at the same time we must
improve our capabilities to deter and
prevent the use of such weapons and
protect ourselves against their effects.

o Contributing to Multilateral Peace
Operations. When our interests call for
it, the United States must also be
prepared to participate in multilateral
efforts to resolve regional conflicts
and bolster new democratic governments.
Thus, our forces must be ready to
participate in peacekeeping, peace
enforcement and other operations in
support of these objectives.

Oo Supporting Counterterrorism Efforts and
Other National Security Objectives. A
number of other tasks remain that U.S.
forces have typically carried out with
both general purpose and specialized
units. These missions include:
counterterrorism and punitive attacks
noncombatant evacuation
counternarcotics operations, special
forces assistance to nations and
humanitarian and disaster relief
operations.

To meet all of these requirements
successfully, our forces must be capable of
responding quickly and operating
effectively. That is, they must be ready to
fight and win. This imperative demands
highly qualified and motivated people;
modern, well-maintained equipment; realistic
training; strategic mobility; sufficient
support and sustainment capabilities, and
proper investment in science and technology.

Major Regional Contingencies
The focus of our planning for major theater

conflict is on deterring and, if necessary,
fighting and defeating aggres-

sion by potentially hostile regional powers,
such as North Korea, Iran or Iraq. Such
states are capable of fielding sizable
military forces that can cause serious
imbalances in military power within regions
important to the United States, with allied
or friendly states often finding it
difficult to match the power of a
potentially aggressive neighbor. To deter
aggression, prevent coercion of allied or
friendly governments and, ultimately, defeat
aggression should it occur, we must prepare
our forces to confront this scale of threat
preferably in concert with our allies and
friends, but unilaterally if necessary. To
do this, we must have forces that can deploy
quickly and supplement U.S. forward based
and forward deployed forces, along with
regional allies, in halting an invasion and
defeating the aggressor, just as we
demonstrated by our rapid response in
October 1994 when Iraq threatened aggression
against Kuwait.

With programmed enhancements, the forces the
Administration is fielding will be
sufficient to help defeat aggression in two
nearly simultaneous major regional
conflicts. As a nation with global
interests, it is important that the United
States maintain forces with aggregate
capabilities on this scale. Obviously, we
seek to avoid a situation in which an
aggressor in one region might be tempted to
take advantage when U.S. forces are heavily
committed elsewhere. More basically,
Maintaining a ""two war"" force helps ensure
that the United States will have sufficient
military capabilities to deter or defeat
aggression by a coalition of hostile powers
or by a larger, more capable adversary than
we foresee today.

We will never know with certainty how an
enemy might fight or precisely what demands
might be placed on our own forces in the
future. The contributions of allies or
coalition partners will vary from place to
place and over time. Thus, balanced U.S.
forces are needed in order to provide a wide
range of complementary capabilities and to
cope with the unpredictable and unexpected.

Overseas Presence

The need to deploy U.S. military forces
abroad in peacetime is also an important
factor in determining our overall force
structure. We will maintain robust overseas
presence in several forms, such as
permanently stationed forces and
prepositioned equipment, deployments and
combined exercises, port calls and other
force visits, as well as military-to-
military contacts. These activities provide
several benefits. Specifically they:

o Gave form and substance to our bilateral
and multilateral security commitments.

o Demonstrate our determination to defend
U.S. and allied interests in critical
regions, deterring hostile nations from
acting contrary to those interests.

o Provide forward elements for rapid
response in crises as well as the bases,
ports and other infrastructure essential
for deployment of U.S.-based forces by
air, sea and land.

o Enhance the effectiveness of coalition
operations, including peace operations,
by improving our ability to operate with
other nations.

o Allow the United States to use its
position of trust to prevent the
development of power vacuums and
dangerous arms races, thereby
underwriting regional stability by
precluding threats to regional security.

o Facilitate regional integration, since
nations that may not be willing to work
together in our absence may be willing
to coalesce around us in a crisis.

o Promote an international security
environment of trust, cooperation, peace
and stability, which is fundamental to
the vitality of developing democracies
and free market economies for America's
own economic well-being and security.

Through training programs, combined
exercises, military contacts
interoperability and shared defense with
potential coalition partners, as well as
security assistance programs that include
judicious foreign military sales, we can
strengthen the local self-defense
capabilities of our friends and allies.
Through active participation in regional
security dialogues, we can reduce regional
tensions, increase transparency in armaments
and improve our bilateral and multilateral
cooperation.

By improving the defense capabilities of our
friends and demonstrating our commitment to
defend common interests, these activities
enhance deterrence, encourage
responsibility-sharing on the part of
friends and allies, decrease the likelihood
that U.S. forces will be necessary if
conflict arises and raise the odds that U.S.
forces will find a relatively favorable
situation should a U.S. response be
required.

10

Counterterrorism, Fighting Drug
Trafficking and Other Missions

While the missions outlined above will
remain the primary determinants of our
general purpose and nuclear force structure,
U.S. military forces and assets will also be
called upon to perform a wide range of other
important missions as well. Some of these
can be accomplished by conventional forces
fielded primarily for theater operations.
Often, however, these missions call for
specialized units and capabilities.

Combating Terrorism

As long as terrorist groups continue to
target American citizens and interests, the
United States will need to have specialized
units available to defeat such groups. From
time to time, we might also find it
necessary to strike terrorists at their
bases abroad or to attack assets valued by
the governments that support them.

Our policy in countering international
terrorists is to make no concessions to
terrorists, continue to pressure state
sponsors of terrorism, fully exploit all
available legal mechanisms to punish
international terrorists and help other
governments improve their capabilities to
combat terrorism.

Countering terrorism effectively requires
close day-to-day coordination among
Executive Branch agencies. The Departments
of State, Justice and Defense, the FBI and
CIA continue to cooperate closely in an
ongoing effort against international
terrorists. Positive results will come from
integration of intelligence, diplomatic and
rule-of-law activities, and through close
cooperation with other governments and
international counterterrorist
organizations.

Improving U.S. intelligence capacities is a
significant part of the U.S. response.
Terrorists, whether from well-organized
groups or the kind of more loosely organized
group responsible for the World Trade Center
bombing, have the advantage of being able to
take the initiative in the timing and choice
of targets. Terrorism involving weapons of
mass destruction represents a particularly
dangerous potential threat that must be
countered.

The United States has made concerted efforts
to punish and deter terrorists. On June 26,
1993, following a determination that Iraq
had plotted an assassination attempt

against former President Bush, President
Clinton ordered a cruise missile attack
against the headquarters of Iraq's
intelligence service in order to send a firm
response and deter further threats.
Similarly, the United States obtained
convictions against defendants in the
bombing of the World Trade Center.

U.S. leadership and close coordination with
other governments and international bodies
will continue, as demonstrated by the UN
Security Council sanctions against Libya for
the Pan Am 103 and UTA 772 bombings, a new
international convention dealing with
detecting and controlling plastic
explosives, and two important
counterterrorism treaties — the Protocol for
the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence
at Airports Serving International Aviation
and the Convention for the Suppression of
Unlawful Attacks Against the Safety of
Maritime Navigation.

Fighting Drug Trafficking

The Administration has undertaken a new
approach to the global scourge of drug abuse
and trafficking that will better integrate
domestic and international activities to
reduce both the demand and the supply of
drugs. Ultimate success will depend on
concerted efforts and partnerships by the
public, all levels of government and the
American private sector with other
governments, private groups and
international bodies.

The U.S. has shifted its strategy from the
past emphasis on transit interdiction toa
more evenly balanced effort with source
countries to build institutions, destroy
trafficking organizations and stop supplies.
We will support and strengthen democratic
institutions abroad, denying narcotics
traffickers a fragile political
infrastructure in which to operate. We will
also cooperate with governments that
demonstrate the political will to confront
the narcotics threat.

Two new comprehensive strategies have been
developed, one to deal with the problem of
cocaine and another to address the growing
threat from high-purity heroin entering this
country. We will engage more aggressively
with international organizations, financial
institutions and nongovernmental
organizations in counternarcotics
cooperation.

At home and in the international arena,
prevention, treatment and economic alter-
natives must work hand-in-hand with law
enforcement and interdiction activities.
Long-

term efforts will be maintained to help
nations develop healthy economies with fewer
market incentives for producing narcotics.
The United States has increased efforts
abroad to foster public awareness and
support for governmental cooperation on a
broad range of activities to reduce the
incidence of drug abuse. Public awareness
of a demand problem in producing or
trafficking countries can be converted into
public support and increased governmental
law enforcement to reduce trafficking and
production. There has been a significant
attitudinal change and awareness in Latin
America and the Caribbean, particularly as
producer and transit nations themselves
become plagued with the ill effects of
consumption.

Other Missions

The United States government is also
responsible for protecting the lives and
safety of Americans abroad. In order to
carry out this responsibility, selected U.S.
military forces are trained and equipped to
evacuate Americans from such situations as
the outbreak of civil or international
conflict and natural or man-made disasters.
For example, U.S. Marines evacuated
Americans from Monrovia, Liberia in August
of 1990, and from Mogadishu, Somalia, in
December of that year. In 1991, U.S. forces
evacuated nearly 20,000 Americans from the
Philippines over a three-week period
following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo.
Last year, U.S. Marines coupled with U.S.
airlift, deployed to Burundi to help ensure
the safe evacuation of U.S. citizens from
ethnic fighting in Rwanda.

U.S. forces also provide invaluable training
and advice to friendly governments
threatened by subversion, lawlessness or
insurgency. At any given time, we have
small teams of military experts deployed in
roughly 25 countries helping host
governments cope with such challenges.

U.S. military forces and assets are
frequently called upon to provide assistance
to victims of floods, storms, drought and
other humanitarian disasters. Both at home
and abroad, U.S. forces provide emergency
food, shelter, medical care and security to
those in need.

Finally, the U.S. will continue as a world
leader in space through its technical
expertise and innovation. Over the past 30
years, as more and more nations have
ventured into space, the U.S. has
steadfastly recognized space as an
international region. Since all nations are
immediately accessible from space, the
maintenance of an international

11

legal regime for space, similar to the
concept of freedom of the high seas, is
especially important. Numerous attempts
have been made in the past to legally limit
access to space by countries that are
unable, either technologically or
economically, to join space-faring nations.
As the commercial importance of space is
developed, the U.S. can expect further
pressure from non-participants to redefine
the status of space, similar to what has
been attempted with exclusive economic zones
constraining the high seas.

Retaining the current international
character of space will remain critical to
achieving U.S. national security goals. Our
main objectives in this area include:

o Continued freedom of access to and use
of space;

o Maintaining the U.S. position as the
major economic, political, military and
technological power in space;

o Deterring threats to U.S. interests in
space and defeating aggressive or
hostile acts against U.S. space assets
if deterrence fails;

o Preventing the spread of weapons of mass
destruction to space;

o Enhancing global partnerships with other
space-faring nations across the spectrum
of economic, political and security
issues.

Deciding When and How to Employ U.S.
Forces

Our strategy calls for the preparation and
deployment of American military forces in
the United States and abroad to support U.S.
diplomacy in responding to key dangers —
those posed by weapons of mass destruction
regional aggression and threats to the
stability of states.

Although there may be many demands for U.S.
involvement, the need to husband scarce
resources suggests that we must carefully
select the means and level of our
participation in particular military
operations. And while it is unwise to
specify in advance all the limitations we
will place on our use of force, we must be
as clear as possible about when and how we
will use it.

12

There are three basic categories of national
interests which can merit the use of our
armed forces. The first involves America's
vital interests, i.e., interests which are
of broad, overriding importance to the
survival, security and vitality of our
national entity — the defense of U.S.
territory, citizens, allies and economic
well-being. We will do whatever it takes to
defend these interests, including — when
necessary — the unilateral and decisive use
of military power. This was demonstrated
clearly in Desert Storm and, more recently,
in Vigilant Warrior.

The second category includes cases in which
important, but not vital, U.S. interests are
threatened. That is, the interests at stake
do not affect our national survival, but
they do affect importantly our national
well-being and the character of the world in
which we live. In such cases, military
forces should only be used if they advance
U.S. interests, they are likely to be able
to accomplish their objectives, the costs
and risks of their employment are
commensurate with the interests at stake,
and other means have been tried and have
failed to achieve our objectives. Such uses
of force should also be limited, reflecting
the relative saliency of the interests we
have at stake. Haiti is the most recent
example in this category.

The third category involves primarily
humanitarian interests. Here, our decisions
focus on the resources we can bring to bear
by using unique capabilities of our military
rather than on the combat power of military
force. Generally, the military is not the
best tool to address humanitarian concerns.
But under certain conditions, the use of our
armed forces may be appropriate: when a
humanitarian catastrophe dwarfs the ability
of civilian relief agencies to respond; when
the need for relief is urgent and only the
military has the ability to jump-start the
longer-term response to the disaster; when
the response requires resources unique to
the military; and when the risk to American
troops is minimal. Rwanda is a good case in
point. U.S. military forces performed
unique and essential roles, stabilized the
situation, and then got out, turning the
operation over to the international relief
community.

The decision on whether and when to use
force is therefore dictated first and
foremost by our national interests. In
those specific areas where our vital or
survival interests are at stake, our use of
force will be decisive and, if necessary,
unilateral. In other situations posing a
less immediate threat, our military
engagement must be targeted selectively

on those areas that most affect our national
interests — for instance, areas where we
have a sizable economic stake or commitments
to allies, and areas where there is a
potential to generate substantial refugee
flows into our nation or our allies.

Second, in all cases the costs and risks of
U.S. military involvement must be judged to
be commensurate with the stakes involved.

We will be more inclined to act where there
is reason to believe that our action will
bring lasting improvement. On the other
hand, our involvement will be more circum-
scribed when other regional or multilateral
actors are better positioned to act than we
are. Even in these cases, however, the
United States will be actively engaged at
the diplomatic level. In every case,
however, we will consider several critical
questions before committing military force:
Have we considered non-military means that
offer a reasonable chance of success? Is
there a clearly defined, achievable mission?
What is the environment of risk we are
entering? What is needed to achieve our
goals? What are the potential costs — both
human and financial — of the engagement? Do
we have reasonable assurance of support from
the American people and their elected
representatives? Do we have timelines and
milestones that will reveal the extent of
success or failure, and, in either case, do
we have an exit strategy?

The decision on how we use force has a
similar set of derived guidelines:

First, when we send American troops abroad
we will send them with a clear mission and
for those operations that are likely to
involve combat, the means to achieve their
objectives decisively, having answered the
questions: What types of U.S. military
capabilities should be brought to bear, and
is the use of military force carefully
matched to our political objectives?

Second, as much as possible, we will seek
the help of our allies and friends or of
relevant international institutions. If our
most important national interests are at
stake, we are prepared to act alone. But
especially on those matters touching
directly the interests of our allies, there
should be a proportionate commitment from
them. Working together increases the
effectiveness of each nation's actions, and
sharing the responsibilities lessens
everyone's load.

These, then, are the calculations of
interest and cost that have influenced our
past uses of military power and will guide
us in the future. Every time this
Administration

has used force, it has balanced interests
against costs. And in each case, the use of
our military has put power behind our
diplomacy, allowing us to make progress we
would not otherwise have achieved.

One final consideration regards the central
role the American people rightfully play in
how the United States wields its power
abroad: the United States cannot long
sustain a fight without the support of the
public. This is true for humanitarian and
other non-traditional interventions, as well
as war. Modern media communications
confront every American with images which
both stir the impulse to intervene and raise
the question of an operation's costs and
risks. When it is judged in America's
interest to intervene, we must use force
with an unwavering commitment to our
objective. While we must continue to
reassess any operation's costs and benefits
as it unfolds and the full range of our
options, reflexive calls for early
withdrawal of our forces as soon as
casualties arise endangers our objectives as
well as our troops. Doing so invites any
rogue actor to attack our troops to try to
force our departure from areas where our
interests lie.

Combating the Spread and Use of
Weapons of Mass Destruction and
Missiles

Weapons of mass destruction — nuclear,
biological and chemical — along with their
associated delivery systems, pose a major
threat to our security and that of our
allies and other friendly nations. Thus, a
key part of our strategy is to seek to stem
the proliferation of such weapons and to
develop an effective capability to deal with
these threats. We also need to maintain
robust strategic nuclear forces and seek to
implement existing strategic arms
agreements.

Nonproliferation and Counterproliferation

A critical priority for the United States is
to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons
and other weapons of mass destruction and
their missile delivery systems. Countries'
weapons programs, and their levels of
cooperation with our nonproliferation
efforts, will be among our most important
criteria in judging the nature of our
bilateral relations.

Through programs such as the Nunn-Lugar

Cooperative Threat Reduction effort and
other denuclearization initiatives

13

important progress has been made to build a
more secure international environment. One
striking example was the successful transfer
last fall of nearly six hundred kilograms of
vulnerable nuclear material from Kazakhstan
to safe storage in the United States.
Kazakhstan was concerned about the security
of the material and requested U.S. assis-
tance in removing it to safe storage. The
Departments of Defense and Energy undertook
a joint mission to retrieve the uranium.
Similarly, under an agreement we secured
with Russia,it is converting tons of highly-
enriched uranium from dismantled weapons
into commercial reactor fuel for purchase by
the United States. The United States is
also working with Russia to enhance control
and accounting of nuclear material.

As a key part of our effort to control
nuclear proliferation, we seek the
indefinite and unconditional extension of
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)
and its universal application. Achieving a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as soon as
possible, ending the unsafeguarded
production of fissile materials for nuclear
weapons purposes and strengthening the
Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are
important goals. They complement our
comprehensive efforts to discourage the ac-
cumulation of fissile materials, to seek to
strengthen controls and constraints on those
materials, and over time, to reduce world-
wide stocks. As President Clinton announced
at last September's UN General Assembly, we
will seek a global ban on the production of
fissile material for nuclear weapons.

To combat missile proliferation, the United
States seeks prudently to broaden membership
of the Missile Technology Control Regime
(MTCR). The Administration supports the
earliest possible ratification and entry in
force of the Chemical Weapons Convention
(CWC) as well as new measures to deter
violations of and enhance compliance with
the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). We
also support improved export controls for
nonproliferation purposes both domestically
and multilaterally.

The proliferation problem is global, but we
must tailor our approaches to specific
regional contexts. We have concluded an
agreed framework to bring North Korea into
full compliance with its nonproliferation
obligations, including the NPT and IAEA
safeguards. We will continue efforts to
prevent Iran from advancing its weapons of
mass destruction objectives and to thwart
Iraq from reconstituting its previous
programs. The United States seeks to cap,
reduce and, ultimately, eliminate the
nuclear and

14

missile capabilities of India and Pakistan.
In the Middle East and elsewhere, we
encourage regional arms control agreements
that address the legitimate security
concerns of all parties. These tasks are
being pursued with other states that share
our concern for the enormous challenge of
stemming the proliferation of such weapons.

he United States has signed bilateral
greements with Russia, Ukraine and South
frica which commit these countries to

dhere to the guidelines of the MTCR. We
lso secured China's commitment to observe
he MTCR guidelines and its agreement not to
ransfer MTCR controlled ground-to- ground
issiles. Russia has agreed not to transfer
pace-launch vehicle technology with
otential military applications to India.
outh Africa has agreed to observe the MTCR
uidelines and to dismantle its Category I
issile systems and has joined the NPT and
ccepted full-scope safeguards. Hungary,

he Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and
oland have joined the Australia Group

which controls the transfer of items that
ould be used to make chemical or biological
leapons). Hungary and Argentina have joined
he MTCR and Brazil has committed itself
publicly to adhere to the MTCR guidelines.
Argentina, Brazil and Chile have brought the
Treaty of Tlatelolco into force. We
continue to push for the dismantlement of
all intercontinental ballistic missiles
located in Ukraine and Kazakhstan. With the
United States and Russia, Ukraine is
pressing forward on implementation of the
Trilateral Statement, which provides for the
transfer of all nuclear warheads from
Ukraine to Russia for dismantlement in
return for fair compensation.

 

t+ TOnVsAM SQHNGTHVs tte ow HM SoH

Thus, the United States seeks to prevent
additional countries from acquiring
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and
the means to deliver them. However, should
such efforts fail, U.S. forces must be
prepared to deter, prevent and defend
against their use. As agreed at the January
1994 NATO Summit, we are working with our
Allies to develop a policy framework to
consider how to reinforce ongoing prevention
efforts and to reduce the proliferation
threat and protect against it.

The United States will retain the capacity
to retaliate against those who might
contemplate the use of weapons of mass
destruction, so that the costs of such use
will be seen as outweighing the gains.
However, to minimize the impact of
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
on our interests, we will need the
capability not only to deter their use
against either ourselves or our allies and
friends, but also, where necessary and
feasible, to prevent it.

This will require improved defensive
capabilities. To minimize the vulnerability
of our forces abroad to weapons of mass
destruction, we are placing a high priority
on improving our ability to locate, identify
and disable arsenals of weapons of mass
destruction, production and storage
facilities for such weapons, and their
delivery systems.

Nuclear Forces

In September, the President approved the
recommendations of the Pentagon's Nuclear
Posture Review (NPR). A key conclusion of
this review is that the United States will
retain a triad of strategic nuclear forces
sufficient to deter any future hostile
foreign leadership with access to strategic
nuclear forces from acting against our vital
interests and to convince it that seeking a
nuclear advantage would be futile.
Therefore, we will continue to maintain
nuclear forces of sufficient size and
capability to hold at risk a broad range of
assets valued by such political and military
leaders. The President approved the NPR's
recommended strategic nuclear force posture
as the U.S. START II force. The forces are:
450-500 Minuteman ICBMs, 14 Trident
submarines all with D-5 missiles, 20 B-2 and
66 B52 strategic bombers, and a non-nuclear
role for the B-1s. This force posture
allows us the flexibility to reconstitute or
reduce further, as conditions warrant. The
NPR also reaffirmed the current posture and
deployment of non-strategic nuclear forces;
the United States will eliminate carrier and
surface ship nuclear weapons capability.

Arms Control

Arms control is an integral part of our
national security strategy. Arms control
can help reduce incentives to initiate
attack; enhance predictability regarding the
size and structure of forces, thus reducing
fear of aggressive intent; reduce the size
of national defense industry establishments
and thus permit the growth of more vital,
nonmilitary industries; ensure confidence in
compliance through effective monitoring and
verification; and, ultimately, contribute to
a more stable and calculable balance of
power .

In the area of strategic arms control,
prescribed reductions in strategic offensive
arms and the steady shift toward less
destabilizing systems remain indispensable.
Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty — joining Belarus'
and Kazakhstan's decision to be non-

nuclear nations — was followed immediately
by the exchange of instruments of
ratification and brought the START I treaty
into force at the December CSCE summit,
paving the way for ratification of the START
II Treaty. Under START II, the United
States and Russia will each be left with
between 3,000 and 3,500 deployed strategic
nuclear warheads, which is a two-thirds
reduction from the Cold War peak. The two
Presidents agreed that once START II is
ratified, both nations will immediately
begin to deactivate or otherwise remove from
combat status, those systems whose
elimination will be required by that treaty,
rather than waiting for the treaty to run
its course through the year 2003. START II
ratification will also open the door to the
next round of strategic arms control, in
which we will consider what further
reductions in, or limitations on, remaining
U.S. and Russian nuclear forces should be
carried out. We will also explore strategic
confidence building measures and mutual
understandings that reduce the risk of
accidental war.

The full and faithful implementation of
other existing arms control agreements,
including the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
Treaty, Strategic Arms Reduction Talks I
(START I), Biological Weapons Convention
(BWC), Intermediate range Nuclear Forces
(INF) Treaty, Conventional Forces in Europe
(CFE) Treaty, several nuclear testing
agreements, the 1994 Vienna Document on
Confidence and Security Building Measures
(CSBMs), Open Skies, the Environmental
Modification Convention (EnMod), Incidents
at Sea and many others will remain an
important element of national security
policy. The on-going negotiation initiated
by the United States to clarify the ABM
Treaty by establishing an agreed demarcation
between strategic and theater ballistic
missiles and update the Treaty to reflect
the break-up of the Soviet Union reflects
the Administration's commitment to
Maintaining the integrity and effectiveness
of crucial arms control agreements.

Future arms control efforts may become more
regional and multilateral. Regional
arrangements can add predictability and
openness to security relations, advance the
rule of international law and promote
cooperation among participants. They help
Maintain deterrence and a stable military
balance at regional levels. The U.S. is
prepared to promote, help negotiate, monitor
and participate in regional arms control
undertakings compatible with American
national security interests. We will gene-
rally support such undertakings but will not
seek to impose regional arms control accords
against the wishes of affected states.

15

AS arms control, whether regional or global,
becomes increasingly multilateral, the
Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva
will play an even more important role. The
U.S. will support measures to increase the
effectiveness and relevance of the CD. Arms
control agreements can head off potential
arms races in certain weapons categories or
in some environments. We will continue to
seek greater transparency, responsibility
and, where appropriate, restraint in the
transfer of conventional weapons and global
military spending. The UN register of
conventional arms transfers is a start in
promoting greater transparency of weapons
transfers and buildups, but more needs to be
done. The U.S. has proposed that the new
regime to succeed the Coordinating Committee
(COCOM) focus on conventional arms sales and
dual-use technologies. Where appropriate,
the United States will continue to pursue
such efforts vigorously. Measures to reduce
oversized defense industrial establishments,
especially those parts involved with weapons
of mass destruction, will also contribute to
stability in the post-Cold War world. The
Administration also will pursue defense
conversion agreements with the Former Soviet
Union (FSU) states, and defense conversion
is also on the agenda with China. The
United States has also proposed a regime to
reduce the number and availability of the
world's long-lived antipersonnel mines whose
indiscriminate and irresponsible use has
reached crisis proportions. As another part
of our effort to address this landmine
problem, the Administration has also
submitted the Convention on Conventional
Weapons to the Senate for advice and
consent.

Peace Operations

In addition to preparing for major regional
contingencies, we must prepare our forces
for peace operations to support democracy or
conflict resolution. The United States,
along with others in the international
community, will seek to prevent and contain
localized conflicts before they require a
military response. U.S. support
capabilities such as airlift, intelligence
and global communications, have often
contributed to the success of multilateral
peace operations, and they will continue to
do so. U.S. combat units are less likely to
be used for most peace operations, but in
some cases their use will be necessary or
desirable and justified by U.S. national
interests as guided by the Presidential
Decision Directive, ""U.S. Policy on
Reforming Multilateral Peace Operations,""
and outlined below.

16

Multilateral peace operations are an
important component of our strategy. From
traditional peacekeeping to peace
enforcement, multilateral peace operations
are sometimes the best way to prevent,
contain, or resolve conflicts that could
otherwise be far more costly and deadly.

Peace operations often have served, and
continue to serve, important U.S. national
interests. In some cases, they have helped
preserve peace between nations, as in Cyprus
and the Golan Heights. In others,
peacekeepers have provided breathing room
for fledgling democracies, as in Cambodia,
El Salvador and Namibia.

At the same time, however, we must recognize
that some types of peace operations make
demands on the UN that exceed the
organization's current capabilities. The
United States is working with the UN head-
quarters and other member states to ensure
that the UN embarks only on peace operations
that make political and military sense and
that the UN is able to manage effectively
those peace operations it does undertake.

We support the creation of a professional UN
peace operations head-quarters with a
planning staff, access to timely
intelligence, a logistics unit that can be
rapidly deployed and a modern operations
center with global communi-cations. The
United States will reduce our peacekeeping
payments to 25 percent while working to
ensure that other nations pay their fair
share. We are also working to ensure that
peacekeeping operations by appropriate
regional organizations such as NATO and the
OSCE can be carried out effectively.

In order to maximize the benefits of UN
peace operations, the United States must
make highly disciplined choices about when
and under what circumstances to support or
participate in them. The need to exercise
such discipline is at the heart of President
Clinton's policy on Reforming Multilateral
Peace Operations. Far from handing a blank
check to the UN, the President's policy
review on peace operations — the most
thorough ever undertaken by an
Administration — requires the United States
to undertake a rigorous analysis of
requirements and capabilities before voting
to support or participate in peace
operations. The United States has not
hesitated to use its position on the
Security Council to ensure that the UN
authorizes only those peace operations that
meet these standards.

Most UN peacekeeping operations do not
involve U.S. forces. On those occasions
when we consider contributing U.S. forces to
a UN peace operation, we will employ

rigorous criteria, including the same
principles that would guide any decision to
employ U.S. forces. In addition, we will
ensure that the risks to U.S. personnel and
the command and control arrangements
governing the participation of American and
foreign forces are acceptable to the United
States.

The question of command and control is
particularly critical. There may be times
when it is in our interest to place U.S.
troops under the temporary operational
control of a competent UN or allied
commander. The United States has done so
many times in the past — from the siege of
Yorktown in the Revolutionary War to the
battles of Desert Storm. However, under no
circumstances will the President ever
relinquish his command authority over U.S.
forces.

Improving the ways the United States and the
UN decide upon and conduct peace operations
will not make the decision to engage any
easier. The lesson we must take away from
our first ventures in peace operations is
not that we should forswear such operations
but that we should employ this tool
selectively and more effectively. In short,
the United States views peace operations as
a means to support our national security
strategy, not as a strategy unto itself.

The President is firmly committed to
securing the active support of the Congress
for U.S. participation in peace operations.
The Administration has set forth a detailed
blueprint to guide consultations with
Congress. With respect to particular
operations, the Administration will
undertake consultations on questions such as
the nature of expected U.S. military
participation, the mission parameters of the
operation, the expected duration, and
budgetary implications. In addition to such
operation- specific consultations, the
Administration has also conducted regular
monthly briefings for congressional staff,
and will deliver an Annual Comprehensive
Report to Congress on Peace Operations.
Congress is critical to the institutional
development of a successful U.S. policy on
peace operations, including the resolution
of funding issues which have an impact on
military readiness.

Two other points deserve emphasis. First,
the primary mission of our Armed Forces is
not peace operations; it is to deter and, if
necessary, to fight and win conflicts in
which our most important interests are
threatened. Second while the international
community can create conditions

for peace, the responsibility for peace
ultimately rests with the people of the
country in question.

Strong Intelligence Capabilities

U.S. intelligence capabilities are critical
instruments of our national power and remain
an integral part of our national security
strategy. Only a strong intelligence effort
can provide adequate warning of threats to
U.S. national security and identify
opportunities for advancing our interests.
Policy analysts, decisionmakers and military
commanders at all levels will continue to
rely on our intelligence community to
collect information unavailable from other
sources and to provide strategic and
tactical analysis to help surmount potential
challenges to our military, political and
economic interests.

Because national security has taken on a
much broader definition in this post-Cold
War era, intelligence must address a much
wider range of threats and dangers. We will
continue to monitor military and technical
threats, to guide long-term force
development and weapons acquisition, and to
directly support military operations.
Intelligence will also be critical for
directing new efforts against regional
conflicts, proliferation of WMD
counterintelligence, terrorism and narcotics
trafficking. In order to adequately
forecast dangers to democracy and to U.S.
economic well-being, the intelligence
community must track political, economic,
social and military developments in those
parts of the world where U.S. interests are
most heavily engaged and where overt
collection of information from open sources
is inadequate. Finally, to enhance the
study and support of worldwide
environmental, humanitarian and disaster
relief activities, technical intelligence
assets (principally imagery) must be
directed to a greater degree towards
collection of data on these subjects.

The collection and analysis of intelligence
related to economic development will play an
increasingly important role in helping
policy makers understand economic trends.
That collection and analysis can help level
the economic playing field by identifying
threats to U.S. companies from foreign
intelligence services and unfair trading
practices.

This strategy requires that we take steps to
reinforce current intelligence capabilities
and overt foreign service reporting, within
the limits of our resources, and similar

17

steps to enhance coordination of clandestine
and overt collection. Key goals include to.

o Provide timely warning of strategic
threats, whether from the remaining
arsenal of weapons in the former Soviet
Union or from other nations with weapons
of mass destruction;

© Ensure timely intelligence support to
military operations;

@ Provide early warning of potential
crises and facilitate preventive
diplomacy;

o Develop new strategies for collection
production and dissemination (including
closer relationships between
intelligence producers and consumers) to
make intelligence products more
responsive to current consumer needs;

o Improve worldwide technical capabilities
to detect, identify and determine the
efforts of foreign nations to develop
weapons of mass destruction;

o Enhance counterintelligence
capabilities;

o Provide focused support for law
enforcement agencies in areas like
counternarcotics, counterterrorism and
illegal technology trade;

o Streamline intelligence operations and
organizations to gain efficiency and
integration;

o Revise long-standing security
restrictions where possible to make
intelligence data more useful to
intelligence consumers.

o Develop security countermeasures based
on sound threat analysis and risk
Management practices

To advance these goals the President
significantly restructured
counterintelligence policy development and
interagency coordination. In a Presidential
Decision Directive (PDD) on U.S.
counterintelligence effectiveness, the
President took immediate steps to improve
our ability to counter both traditional and
new threats to our Nation's security in the
post-Cold War era. The President further
directed a comprehensive restructuring of
the process by which our security policies
practices and procedures are

18

developed and implemented. The PDD on
Security Policy Coordination ensures the
development of security policies and
practices that realistically meet the
threats we face as they continue to evolve
at a price we can afford, while guaranteeing
the fair and equitable treatment of all
Americans upon whom we rely to guard our
nation's security. Consistent with the
provisions of the FY 1995 Intelligence
Authorization Act, President Clinton has
also directed the Chairman of the Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board to conduct a
comprehensive review of the roles and
missions of the intelligence community and
fundamentally evaluate and define the need
for intelligence in the post-Cold war
environment.

The Environment and Sustainable
Development

The more clearly we understand the complex
interrelationships between the different
parts of our world's environment, the better
we can understand the regional and even
global effects of local changes to the
environment. Increasing competition for the
dwindling reserves of uncontaminated air,
arable land, fisheries and other food
sources, and water, once considered ""free""
goods, is already a very real risk to
regional stability around the world. The
range of environmental risks serious enough
to jeopardize international stability
extends to massive population flight from
man-made or natural catastrophes, such as
Chernobyl or the East African drought, and
to large-scale ecosystem damage caused by
industrial pollution, deforestation, loss of
biodiversity, ozone depletion,
desertification, ocean pollution and
ultimately climate change. Strategies
dealing with environmental issues of this
magnitude will require partnerships between
governments and nongovernmental
organizations, cooperation between nations
and regions, and a commitment to a
strategically focused, long-term policy for
emerging environmental risks.

The decisions we make today regarding
military force structures typically
influence our ability to respond to threats
20 to 30 years in the future. Similarly,
our current decisions regarding the
environment and natural resources will
affect the magnitude of their security risks
over at least a comparable period of time,
if not longer. The measure of our
difficulties in the future will be settled
by the steps we take in the present.

AS a priority initiative, the U.S.
successfully led efforts at the September
Cairo Conference to develop a consensus
Program of Action to address the continuous
climb in global population, including
increased availability of family planning
and reproductive health services,
sustainable economic development, the
empowerment of women to include enhanced
educational opportunities and a reduction in
infant and child mortality. Rapid
population growth in the developing world
and unsustainable consumption patterns in
industrialized nations are the root of both
present and potentially even greater forms
of environmental degradation and resource
depletion. A conservative estimate of the
globe's population projects 8.5 billion
people on the planet by the year 2025. Even
when making the most generous allowances for
advances in science and technology, one
cannot help but conclude that population
growth and environmental pressures will feed
into immense social unrest and make the
world substantially more vulnerable to
serious international frictions.

Promoting Prosperity at Home

A central goal of our national security
strategy is to promote America's prosperity
through efforts both at home and abroad.
Our economic and security interests are
increasingly inseparable. Our prosperity at
home depends on engaging actively abroad.
The strength of our diplomacy, our ability
to maintain an unrivaled military, the
attractiveness of our values abroad — all
these depend in part on the strength of our
economy.

Enhancing American Competitiveness

Our primary economic goal is to strengthen
the American economy. The first step toward
that goal was reducing the federal deficit
and the burden it imposes on the economy and
future generations. The economic program
passed in 1993 has restored investor
confidence in the U.S. and strengthened our
position in international economic
negotiations. Under the Clinton economic
plan, the deficit will be reduced over 700
billion dollars by Fiscal Year 1998.
President Clinton has also lowered the
deficit as a percentage of the Gross
Domestic Product from 4.9 percent in Fiscal
Year 1992 to 2.4 percent in Fiscal Year 1995
— the lowest since 1979.

And Fiscal Year 1995 will be the first time
that the deficit has been reduced three
years in a row since the Truman
Administration. We are building on this
deficit reduction

effort with other steps to improve American
competitiveness: investing in science and
technology; assisting defense conversion;
improving information networks and other
vital infrastructure; and improving
education and training programs for
America's workforce. We are structuring our
defense R&D effort to place greater emphasis
on dual-use technologies that can enhance
competitiveness and meet pressing military
needs. We are also reforming the defense
acquisition system so that we can develop
and procure weapons and materiel more
efficiently.

Partnership with Business and Labor

Our economic strategy views the private
sector as the engine of economic growth. It
sees government's role as a partner to the
private sector, acting as an advocate of
U.S. business interests; leveling the
playing field in international markets;
helping to boost American exports; and
finding ways to remove domestic and foreign
barriers to the creativity, initiative and
productivity of American business.

To this end, on September 29, 1993, the
Administration published its report creating
America's first national export strategy and
making 65 specific recommendations for
reforming the way government works with the
private sector to expand exports. Among the
recommendations were significant
improvements in advocacy, export financing
market information systems and product
standards education. The results of these
reforms could enable U.S. exports to reach
the trillion dollar mark by the turn of the
century, which would help create at least
six million new American jobs.

Another critical element in boosting U.S.
exports is reforming the outdated export
licensing system. That reform began with
significant liberalization of export
licensing controls for computers,
supercomputers and telecommunications
equipment. The Administration is also
seeking comprehensive reform of the Export
Administration Act, which governs the
process of export licensing. The goal of
this reform is to strengthen our ability to
prevent proliferation and protect other
national interests, while removing
unnecessarily burdensome licensing
requirements left over from the Cold war.

Enhancing Access to Foreign Markets
The success of American business is more

than ever dependent upon success in
international markets. The

19

ability to compete internationally also
assures that our companies will continue to
innovate and increase productivity, which
will in turn lead to improvements in our own
living standards. But to compete abroad,
our firms need access to foreign markets
just as foreign industries have access to
our open market. We vigorously pursue
measures to increase access for our
companies — through bilateral, regional and
multilateral arrangements.

The North American Free Trade
Agreement

On December 3, 1993, President Clinton
signed the North American Free Trade Act
(NAFTA), which creates a free trade zone
among the United States, Canada and Mexico.
NAFTA has already created more than 100,000
American jobs. NAFTA has increased Mexico's
capacity to cooperate with our nation ona
wide range of issues that cross our 2000
mile border — including the environment,
narcotics trafficking and illegal
immigration.

Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation

Our economic relations depend vitally on our
ties with the Asia Pacific region, which is
the world's fastest-growing economic region.
In November 1993, President Clinton convened
the first-ever summit of the leaders of the
economies that constitute the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. U.S.
initiatives in the APEC forum will open new
opportunities for economic cooperation and
permit U.S. companies to become involved in
substantial infrastructure planning and
construction throughout the region. The
trade and investment framework agreed to in
1993 provided the basis for enhancing the
""open regionalism"" that defines APEC. At
the second leaders meeting in November 1994,
the leaders of APEC further drove the
process by accepting the goal of free and
open trade and investment throughout the
region by early in the 21st Century, and
agreeing to lay out a blueprint for
achieving that goal by the Osaka APEC
leaders meeting.

Uruguay Round of GATT

The successful conclusion in December 1993
of the Uruguay Round of the negotiations
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) significantly strengthened the
world trading system. The Uruguay Round
accord is the largest, most comprehensive
trade agreement in history. It will create
hundreds of thousands

20

of new U.S. jobs and expand opportunities
for U.S. businesses. For the first time,
international trade rules will apply to
services, intellectual property and
investments, and effective rules will apply
to agriculture. The Uruguay Round also
continued the cuts in tariff rates
throughout the world that began just after
the Second World War. Working with
Congress, the President secured U.S.
approval of this pathbreaking agreement and
the resulting World Trade Organization which
provides a forum to resolve disputes openly.
The President remains committed to ensuring
that the commitments in the Uruguay Round
agreement are fulfilled.

U.S. - Japan Framework Agreement

While Japan is America's second-largest
export market, foreign access to the
Japanese market remains limited in important
sectors, including automobiles and
automobile parts. Japan's persistent
current account surpluses are a major
imbalance in the global economy. In July
1993 President Clinton and Japanese Prime
Minister Miyazawa established the U.S.-Japan
Framework for Economic Partnership to
redress the imbalances in our economic
relationship. In October 1994, the United
States and Japan reached framework
agreements regarding government procurement
of medical technologies and
telecommunications (including Nippon
Telephone and Telegraph (NPP) procurement)
In December, we concluded a further
agreement on flat glass. We have also
reached framework agreements on financial
services and intellectual property rights.
The Administration is committed to ensuring
that competitive American goods and services
have fair access to the Japanese market. We
will continue to work to ensure that Japan
takes measures to open its markets and
stimulate its economy, both to benefit its
own people and to fulfill its international
responsibilities.

Summit of the Americas

America's economy benefits enormously from
the opportunity offered by the commitment of
the democratic nations of the Western
Hemisphere to negotiate a free trade
agreement for the region by 2005. The
Western Hemisphere is our largest export
market, constituting over 35 percent of all
U.S. sales abroad. The action plan will
accelerate progress toward free, integrated
markets which will create new high-wage jobs
and sustain economic growth for America.

The invitation to Chile to begin
negotiations to join NAFTA is the first step
toward the Summit's goal of reaching a
hemispheric free-trade zone.

Expanding the Realm of Free Trade

The conclusion of NAFTA, the Uruguay Round
the Bogor Declaration of the 1994 APEC
leaders meeting, and the Summit of the
Americas' action plan represents
unprecedented progress toward more open
markets both at the regional and global
levels. The Administration intends to
continue its efforts in further enhancing
U.S. access to foreign markets. The World
Trade Organization will provide a new
institutional lever for securing such
access. Emerging markets, particularly
along the Pacific Rim, present vast
opportunities for American enterprise, and
APEC now provides a suitable vehicle for the
exploration of such opportunities.
Similarly, the United States convened the
Summit of the Americas to seize the
opportunities created by the movement toward
open markets throughout the hemisphere. All
such steps in the direction of expanded
trading relationships will be undertaken in
a way consistent with protection of the
international environment and to the goal of
sustainable development here and abroad.

Strengthening Macroeconomic
Coordination

AS national economies become more integrated
internationally, the U.S. cannot thrive in
isolation from developments abroad.
International economic expansion is
benefiting from G-7 macroeconomic policy
coordination. To improve global
macroeconomic performance, we will continue
to work through the G-7 process to promote
growth-oriented policies to complement our
own efforts.

Providing for Energy Security

The United States depends on oil for more
than 40% of its primary energy needs.
Roughly 45% of our oil needs are met with
imports, and a large share of these imports
come from the Persian Gulf area. The
experiences of the two oil shocks and the
Gulf War show that an interruption of oil
supplies can have a significant impact on
the economies of the United States and its
allies. Appropriate economic responses can
substantially mitigate the balance of
payments and inflationary impacts of an oil
shock; appropriate foreign policy responses
to events such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
can limit the magnitude of the crisis.

Over the longer term, the United States'
dependence on access to foreign oil sources
will be increasingly important

as our resources are depleted. The U.S.
economy has grown roughly 75% since the
first oil shock; yet during that time our
oil consumption has remained virtually
stable and oil production has declined.

High oil prices did not generate enough new
oil exploration and discovery to sustain
production levels from our depleted resource
base. These facts show the need for
continued and extended reliance on energy
efficiency and conservation and development
of alternative energy sources. Conservation
Measures notwithstanding, the U.S. has a
vital interest in unrestricted access to
this critical resource.

Promoting Sustainable Development
Abroad

Broad-based economic development not only
improves the prospects for democratic
development in developing countries, but
also expands the demands for U.S. exports.
Economic growth abroad can alleviate
pressure on the global environment, reduce
the attraction of illegal narcotics trade
and improve the health and economic
productivity of global populations.

The environmental aspects of ill-designed
economic growth are clear. Environmental
damage will ultimately block economic
growth. Rapid urbanization is outstripping
the ability of nations to provide jobs,
education and other services to new
citizens. The continuing poverty of a
quarter of the world's people leads to
hunger, malnutrition, economic migration and
political unrest. Widespread illiteracy and
lack of technical skills hinder employment
opportunities and drive entire populations
to support themselves on increasingly
fragile and damaged resource bases. New
diseases such as AIDS and epidemics, often
spread through environmental degradation
threaten to overwhelm the health facilities
of developing countries, disrupt societies
and stop economic growth. These realities
must be addressed by sustainable development
programs which offer viable alternatives.
U.S. leadership is of the essence. If such
alternatives are not developed, the
consequences for the planet's future will be
grave indeed.

Domestically, the U.S. must work hard to
halt local and cross-border environmental
degradation. In addition, the U.S. should
foster environmental technology targeting
pollution prevention, control, and cleanup.
Companies that invest in energy efficiency,
clean manufacturing, and environmental
services today will create the high-quality,
high-wage jobs of tomorrow. By providing
access to these types of technologies, our
exports can also provide the

21

means for other nations to achieve
environmentally sustainable economic growth.
At the same time, we are taking ambitious
steps at home to better manage our natural
resources and reduce energy and other
consumption, decrease waste generation and
increase our recycling efforts.

Internationally, the Administration's
foreign assistance program focuses on four
key elements of sustainable development:
broad-based economic growth; the
environment; population and health; and
democracy. We will continue to advocate
environmentally sound private investment and
responsible approaches by international
lenders. At our urging, the Multilateral
Development Banks (MDB's) are now placing
increased emphasis upon sustainable
development in their funding decisions, to
include a commitment to perform
environmental assessments on projects for
both internal and public scrutiny. In
particular, the Global Environmental
Facility (GEF), established last year, will
provide a source of financial assistance to
the developing world for climate change,
biodiversity and oceans initiatives.

The U.S. is taking specific steps now in all
of these areas:

o In June 1993, the United States signed
the Convention on Biological Diversity,
which aims to protect and utilize the
world's genetic inheritance. The
Interior Department has been directed to
create a national biological survey to
help protect species and to help the
agricultural and biotechnical industries
identify new sources of food, fiber and
medications.

o New policies are being implemented to
ensure the sustainable management of
U.S. forests by the year 2000, as
pledged internationally. In addition,
U.S. bilateral forest assistance
programs are being expanded, and the
United States is promoting sustainable
Management of tropical forests.

o In the wake of the 1992 United Nations
Conference on Environment and
Development, the United States has
sought to reduce land-based sources of
marine pollution, maintain populations
of marine species at healthy and
productive levels and protect endangered
marine mammals.

22

o The United States has focused technical
assistance and encouraged
nongovernmental environmental groups to
provide expertise to the republics of
the Former Soviet Union and Central and
Eastern European nations that have
suffered the most acute environmental
crises. The Agency for International
Development, the Environmental
Protection Agency and other U.S.
agencies are engaged in technical
cooperation with many countries around
the world to advance these goals.

o The Administration is leading a renewed
global effort to address population
problems and promote international
consensus for stabilizing world
population growth. Our comprehensive
approach will stress family planning and
reproductive health care, maternal and
child health, education and improving
the status of women. The International
Conference on Population Development,
held in September in Cairo, endorsed
these approaches as important strategies
in achieving our global population
goals.

Promoting Democracy

All of America's strategic interests — from
promoting prosperity at home to checking
global threats abroad before they threaten
our territory — are served by enlarging the
community of democratic and free market
nations. Thus, working with new democratic
states to help preserve them as democracies
committed to free markets and respect for
human rights, is a key part of our national
security strategy.

One of the most gratifying and encouraging
developments of the past 15 years is the
explosion in the number of states moving
away from repressive governance and toward
democracy. Since the success of many of
those experiments is by no means assured,
our strategy of enlargement must focus on
the consolidation of those regimes and the
broadening of their commitment to democracy.
At the same time, we seek to increase
respect for fundamental human rights in all
states and encourage an evolution to
democracy where that is possible.

The enlargement of the community of market
democracies respecting human rights and the
environment is manifest in a number of ways:

o More than 30 nations in Central and
Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union,
Latin America, Africa and East Asia
have, over the past 10 years, adopted
the structures of a constitutional
democracy and held free elections;

o The nations of the Western Hemisphere
have proclaimed their commitment to
democratic regimes and to the collective
responsibility of the nations of the OAS
to respond to threats to democracy.

o In the Western Hemisphere, only Cuba is
not a democratic state.

o Nations as diverse as South Africa,
Cambodia and El Salvador have resolved
bitter internal disputes with agreement
on the creation of constitutional
democracies.

The first element of our democracy strategy
is to work with the other democracies of the
world and to improve our cooperation with
them on security and economic issues. We
also seek their support in enlarging the
realm of democratic nations.

The core of our strategy is to help
democracy and markets expand and survive in
other places where we have the strongest
security concerns and where we can make the
greatest difference. This is not a
democratic crusade; it is a pragmatic
commitment to see freedom take hold where
that will help us most. Thus, we must
target our effort to assist states that
affect our strategic interests, such as
those with large economies, critical
locations, nuclear weapons or the potential
to generate refugee flows into our own
nation or into key friends and allies. We
must focus our efforts where we have the
most leverage. And our efforts must be
demand-driven — they must focus on nations
whose people are pushing for reform or have
already secured it.

Russia is a key state in this regard. If we
can support and help consolidate democratic
and market reforms in Russia (and the other
newly independent states), we can help turn
a former threat into a region of valued
diplomatic and economic partners. Our
intensified interaction with Ukraine has
helped move that country on to the path of
economic reform, which is critical to its
long-term stability. In addition, our
efforts in Russia, Ukraine and the other
states support and facilitate our efforts to
achieve

continued reductions in nuclear arms and
compliance with international
nonproliferation accords.

The new democracies in Central and Eastern
Europe are another clear example, given
their proximity to the great democratic
powers of Western Europe, their importance
to our security, and their potential
markets.

Since our ties across the Pacific are no
less important than those across the
Atlantic, pursuing enlargement in the Asian
Pacific is a third example. We will work to
support the emerging democracies of the
region and to encourage other states along
the same path.

Continuing the great strides toward
democracy and markets in our hemisphere is
also a key concern and was behind the
President's decision to host the Summit of
the Americas in December 1994. As we
continue such efforts, we should be on the
lookout for states whose entry into the camp
of market democracies may influence the
future direction of an entire region; South
Africa now holds that potential with regard
to sub-Saharan Africa.

How should the United States help
consolidate and enlarge democracy and
markets in these states? The answers are as
varied as the nations involved, but there
are common elements. We must continue to
help lead the effort to mobilize
international resources, as we have with
Russia, Ukraine and the other new
independent states. We must be willing to
take immediate public positions to help
staunch democratic reversals, as we have in
Haiti and Guatemala. We must give
democratic nations the fullest benefits of
integration into foreign markets, which is
part of why NAFTA and the GATT ranked so
high on our agenda. And we must help these
nations strengthen the pillars of civil
society, improve their market institutions
and fight corruption and political discon-
tent through practices of good governance.

At the same time as we work to ensure the
success of emerging democracies, we must
also redouble our efforts to guarantee basic
human rights on a global basis. At the 1993
United Nations Conference on Human Rights,
the United States forcefully and
successfully argued for a reaffirmation of
the universality of such rights and improved
international mechanisms for their
promotion. In the wake of this gathering,
the UN has named a High Commissioner for
Human Rights, and the rights of women have
been afforded a new international
precedence. The United

23

States has taken the lead in assisting the
UN to set up international tribunals to
enforce accountability for the war crimes in
the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda.

The United States also continues to work for
the protection of human rights ona
bilateral basis. To demonstrate our own
willingness to adhere to international human
rights standards, the United States ratified
the international convention prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of race, and the
Administration is seeking Senate consent to
ratification for the convention prohibiting
discrimination against women. The United
States will play a major role in promoting
women's rights internationally at the UN
Women's Conference in September.

In all these efforts, a policy of engagement
and enlargement should take on a second
meaning: we should pursue our goals through
an enlarged circle not only of government
officials but also of private and
nongovernmental groups. Private firms are
natural allies in our efforts to strengthen
market economies. Similarly, our goal of
strengthening democracy and civil society
has a natural ally in labor unions, human
rights groups, environmental advocates,
chambers of commerce and election monitors.
Just as we rely on force multipliers in
defense, we should welcome these ""diplomacy
multipliers,"" such as the National Endowment
for Democracy.

Supporting the global movement toward
democracy requires a pragmatic and long-term
effort focused on both values and
institutions. The United States must build
on the opportunities achieved through the
successful conclusion of the Cold War. Our
long-term goal is a world in which each of
the major powers is democratic, with many
other nations joining the community of
market democracies as well.

Our efforts to promote democracy and human
rights are complemented by our humanitarian
assistance programs which are designed to
alleviate human suffering and to

24

pave the way for progress towards
establishing democratic regimes with a
commitment to respect for human rights and
appropriate strategies for economic
development. We are also exploring ideas
such as the suggestion of Argentina's
President Menem for the creation of an
international civilian rapid response
capability for humanitarian crises
including a school and training for
humanitarian operations.

Through humanitarian assistance and policy
initiatives aimed at the sources of
disruption, we seek to mitigate the
contemporary migration and refugee crises,
foster longterm global cooperation and
strengthen involved international
institutions. The U.S. will provide
appropriate financial support and will work
with other nations and international bodies
such as the International Red Cross and the
UN High Commissioner for Refugees, in
seeking voluntary repatriation of refugees —
taking into full consideration human rights
concerns as well as the economic conditions
that may have driven them out in the first
place. Helping refugees return to their
homes in Mozambique, Afghanistan, Eritrea,
Somalia and Guatemala, for example, is a
high priority.

Relief efforts will continue for people
displaced by the conflict in Bosnia and
other republics of the former Yugoslavia.

We will act in concert with other nations
and the UN against the illegal smuggling of
Chinese into this country. In concert with
the tools of diplomatic, economic and
military power, our humanitarian and refugee
policies can bear results, as was evident in
Haiti. We provided temporary safe haven at
Guantanamo Naval Base for those Haitians who
feared for their safety and left by sea
until we helped restore democracy.

III. INTEGRATED REGIONAL APPROACHES

The United States is a genuinely global
power. Our policy toward each of the
world's regions reflects our overall
strategy tailored to their unique challenges
and opportunities. This section highlights
the application of our strategy to each of
the world's regions; our broad objectives
and thrust, rather than an exhaustive list
of all our policies and interests. It
illustrates how we integrate our commitment
to the promotion of democracy and the
enhancement of American prosperity with our
security requirements to produce a mutually
reinforcing policy.

Europe and Eurasia

Our strategy of enlargement and engagement
is central to U.S. policy towards post-Cold
War Europe. European stability is vital to
our own security, a lesson we have learned
twice at great cost this century. Vibrant
European economies mean more jobs for
Americans at home and investment
opportunities abroad. With the collapse of
the Soviet empire and the emergence of new
democracies in its wake, the United States
has an unparalleled opportunity to
contribute toward a free and undivided
Europe. Our goal is an integrated
democratic Europe cooperating with the
United States to keep the peace and promote
prosperity.

The first and most important element of our
strategy in Europe must be security through
military strength and cooperation. The Cold
War is over, but war itself is not over.

As we know, war continues in the former
Yugoslavia. While that war does not pose a
direct threat to our security or warrant
unilateral U.S. involvement, U.S. policy is
focused on five goals: achieving a political
settlement in

Bosnia that preserves the country's
territorial integrity and provides a viable
future for all its peoples; preventing the
spread of the fighting into a broader Balkan
war that could threaten both allies and the
stability of new democratic states in
Central and Eastern Europe; stemming the
destabilizing flow of refugees from the
conflict; halting the slaughter of
innocents; and helping to support NATO's
central role in post-Cold War Europe while
Maintaining our role in shaping Europe's
security architecture.

Our leadership paved the way to NATO's
February 1994 ultimatum that ended the heavy
Serb bombardment of Sarajevo, Bosnia's
capital. Our diplomatic leadership brought
an end to the fighting between the Muslims
and Croats in Bosnia and helped establish a
bicommunal Bosnian-Croat Federation. Since
April 1994, we have been working with the
warring parties through the Contact Group
(United States, Russia, United Kingdom,
France and Germany) to help the parties
reach a negotiated settlement. Our goal is
to bring an end to the war in Bosnia
consistent with the Contact Group plan which
would preserve Bosnia as a single state
within its existing borders while providing
for an equitable division of territory
between the Muslim-Croat Federation and the
Bosnian Serb entity. While we have not yet
succeeded in achieving a political
settlement, diplomatic efforts in the final
months of 1994 helped produce a cease-fire
and a cessation of hostilities agreement
that took effect on January 1, 1995. On
this basis, efforts are now underway with
our Contact Group partners to renew
negotiations on a political settlement based
on the Contact Group plan.

Should these new diplomatic efforts falter,
we remain prepared to move forward with our
proposal at the UN to lift the arms embargo
on Bosnia-Herzegovina, multilaterally. We
remain strongly opposed to a unilateral
lifting of

25

the arms embargo as a step that would have
grave consequences for NATO and U.S.
interests. Should large-scale fighting
resume and UN troops need to be withdrawn,
the President has agreed, in principle, to
provide U.S. support, including the use of
ground forces, to a NATO-led operation to
help assure a safe withdrawal. We also
remain prepared to help implement a final
peace settlement in Bosnia.

As we work to resolve that tragedy and ease
the suffering of its victims we also need to
transform European and trans-Atlantic
institutions so they can better address such
conflicts and advance Europe's integration.
Many institutions will play a role,
including the European Union (EU), the
Western European Union (WEU), the Council of
Europe (CE), the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the
United Nations. But NATO, history's
greatest political-military alliance, must
be central to that process.

The NATO alliance will remain the anchor of
American engagement in Europe and the
linchpin of transatlantic security. That is
why we must keep it strong, vital and
relevant. For the United States and its
allies, NATO has always been far more than a
transitory response to a temporary threat.
It has been a guarantor of European
democracy and a force for European
stability. That is why its mission endures
even though the Cold War has receded into
the past. And that is why its benefits are
so clear to Europe's new democracies.

Only NATO has the military forces, the
integrated command structure, the broad
legitimacy and the habits of cooperation
that are essential to draw in new
participants and respond to new challenges.
One of the deepest transformations within
the transatlantic community over the past
half-century occurred because the armed
forces of our respective nations trained,
studied and marched through their careers
together. It is not only the compatibility
of our weapons, but the camaraderie of our
warriors that provide the sinews behind our
mutual security guarantees and our best hope
for peace.

Since the end of the Cold War, the United
States has significantly reduced the level
of U.S. military forces stationed in Europe.
We have determined that a force of roughly
100,000 U.S. military personnel assigned to
U.S. European command will preserve U.S.
influence and leadership in NATO and provide
a deterrent posture that is

26

visible to all Europeans. While we continue
to examine the proper mix of forces, this
level of permanent presence, augmented by
forward deployed naval forces and
reinforcements available from the United
States, is sufficient to respond to
plausible crises and contributes to
stability in the region. Such a force level
also provides a sound basis for U.S.
participation in multinational training and
preserves the capability to deter or respond
to larger threats in Europe and to support
limited NATO operations ""out of area.""

With the end of the Cold war, NATO's mission
is evolving; today NATO plays a crucial role
helping to manage ethnic and national
conflict in Europe. With U.S. leadership,
NATO has provided the muscle behind efforts
to bring about a peaceful settlement in the
former Yugoslavia. NATO air power enforces
the UN-mandated no-fly zone and provides
support to UN peacekeepers. NATO stands
ready to help support the peace once the
parties reach an agreement.

With the adoption of the U.S. initiative,
Partnership for Peace, at the January 1994
summit, NATO is playing an increasingly
important role in our strategy of European
integration, extending the scope of our
security cooperation to the new democracies
of Europe. Twenty-five nations, including
Russia, have already joined the partnership
which will pave the way for a growing
program of military cooperation and
political consultation. Partner countries
are sending representatives to NATO
headquarters near Brussels and to a military
coordination cell at Mons — the site of
Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe
(SHAPE). Joint exercises have taken place
in Poland and the Netherlands. In keeping
with our strategy of enlargement, PFP is
open to all former members of the Warsaw
Pact as well as other European states. Each
partner will set the scope and pace of its
cooperation with NATO.

The North Atlantic Treaty has always looked
to the addition of members who shared the
Alliance's purposes and its values, its
commitment to respect borders and
international law, and who could add to its
strength; indeed, NATO has expanded three
times since its creation. In January 1994,
President Clinton made it plain that ""the
question is no longer whether NATO will take
on new members, but when and how we will do
so."" Last December, we and our Allies began
a steady, deliberate, and transparent
process that will lead to NATO expansion.

During 1995, we will come to agreement with
our allies on the process and principles
and we will share our conclusions with the
members of the Partnership for Peace (PFP)
Once this effort is complete, NATO can turn
to the question of candidates and timing.
Each nation will be considered individually.
No non-member of NATO will have a veto.

Expanding the Alliance will promote our
interests by reducing the risk of
instability or conflict in Europe's eastern
half — the region where two world wars and
the Cold War began. It will help assure
that no part of Europe will revert to a zone
of great power competition or a sphere of
influence. It will build confidence, and
give new democracies a powerful incentive to
consolidate their reforms. And each
potential member will be judged according to
the strength of its democratic institutions
and its capacity to contribute to the goals
of the Alliance.

As the President has made clear, NATO
expansion will not be aimed at replacing one
division of Europe with a new one, but to
enhance the security of all European states,
members and non-members alike. In this
regard, we have a major stake in ensuring
that Russia is engaged as a vital
participant in European security affairs.

We are committed to a growing, healthy
NATO-Russia relationship and want to see
Russia closely involved in the Partnership
for Peace. Recognizing that no single
institution can meet every challenge to
peace and stability in Europe, we have begun
a process that will strengthen the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) and enhance its conflict
prevention and peacekeeping capabilities.

The second element of the new strategy for
Europe is economic. The United States seeks
to build on vibrant and open market
economies, the engines that have given us
the greatest prosperity in human history
over the last several decades in Europe and
in the United States. To this end, we
strongly support the process of European
integration embodied in the European Union
and seek to deepen our partnership with the
EU in support of our economic goals, but
also commit ourselves to the encouragement
of bilateral trade and investment in
countries not part of the EU.

The nations of the European Union face
particularly significant economic challenges
with nearly 20 million people unemployed
and, in Germany's case, the extraordinarily
high costs of unification. Among the
Atlantic nations, economic stagnation has
clearly eroded public support in

finances for outward-looking foreign
policies and for greater integration. We
are working closely with our West European
partners to expand employment and promote
long-term growth, building on the results of
the Detroit Jobs Conference and the Naples
G-7 Summit. A White House-sponsored Trade
and Investment Conference for Central and
Eastern Europe took place in Cleveland in
January.

In Northern Ireland, the Administration is
implementing a package of initiatives to
promote the peace process. The Secretary of
Commerce led a Trade and Investment mission
to Belfast in December 1994, and in April
the President will host a White House
Conference in Philadelphia on Trade and
Investment in Northern Ireland.

As we work to strengthen our own economies
we must know that we serve our own
prosperity and our security by helping the
new market reforms in the new democracies in
Europe's East that will help to deflate the
region's demagogues. It will help ease
ethnic tensions. It will help new
democracies take root.

In Russia, Ukraine and the other new
independent states of the former Soviet
Union, the economic transformation
undertaken will go down as one of the great
historical events of this century. The
Russian Government has made remarkable
progress toward privatizing the economy
(over 50 percent of the Russian Gross
Domestic Product is now generated by the
private sector) and reducing inflation, and
Ukraine has taken bold steps of its own to
institute much needed economic reforms. But
much remains to be done to build on the
reform momentum to assure durable economic
recovery and social protection. President
Clinton has given strong and consistent
support to this unprecedented reform effort,
and has mobilized the international
community to provide structural economic
assistance, for example, securing agreement
by the G-7 to make available four billion
dollars in grants and loans as Ukraine
implemented economic reform.

The short-term difficulties of taking
Central and Eastern Europe into Western
economic institutions will be more than
rewarded if they succeed and if they are
customers for America's and Western Europe's
goods and services tomorrow. That is why
this Administration has been committed to
increase support substantially for market
reforms in the new states of the former
Soviet Union, and why we have continued our
support for economic transition

27

in Central and Eastern Europe, while also
paying attention to measures that can
overcome the social dislocations which have
resulted largely from the collapse of the
Soviet-dominated regional trading system.

Ultimately, the success of market reforms to
the East will depend more on trade than aid.
No one nation has enough resources to
markedly change the future of those
countries as they move to free market
systems. One of our priorities, therefore
is to reduce trade barriers with the former
communist states.

The third and final imperative of this new
strategy is to support the growth of
democracy and individual freedoms that has
begun in Russia, the nations of the former
Soviet Union and Europe's former communist
states. The success of these democratic
reforms makes us all more secure; they are
the best answer to the aggressive
nationalism and ethnic hatreds unleashed by
the end of the Cold War. Nowhere is
democracy's success more important to us all
than in these countries.

This will be the work of generations. There
will be wrong turns and even reversals, as
there have been in all countries throughout
history. But as long as these states
continue their progress toward democracy and
respect the rights of their own and other
people, that they understand the rights of
their minorities and their neighbors, we
will support their progress with a steady
patience.

East Asia and the Pacific

East Asia is a region of growing importance
for U.S. security and prosperity; nowhere
are the strands of our three pronged
strategy more intertwined, nor is the need
for continued U.S. engagement more evident.
Now more than ever, security, open markets
and democracy go hand in hand in our
approach to this dynamic region. Last year
President Clinton laid out an integrated
strategy — a New Pacific Community — which
links security requirements with economic
realities and our concern for democracy and
human rights.

In thinking about Asia, we must remember
that security is the first pillar of our new
Pacific community. The United States is a
Pacific nation. We have fought three wars
there in this century. To deter regional
aggression and secure our own interests, we
will maintain an active presence and

28

we will continue to lead. Our deep
bilateral ties with allies such as Japan,
South Korea, Austral, Thailand and the
Philippines, and a continued American
military presence will serve as the
foundation for America's security role in
the region. Currently, our forces number
nearly 100,000 personnel in East Asia. In
addition to performing the general forward
deployment functions outlined above, they
contribute to regional stability by
deterring aggression and adventurism.

As a key element of our strategic commitment
to the region, we are pursuing stronger
efforts to combat the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction on the Korean
Peninsula and in South Asia. In October
1994, we reached an important agreed
framework with North Korea — stopping, and
eventually eliminating, its nuclear weapons
program — and an agreement with China,
limiting its sales of ballistic missiles.

Another example of our security commitment
to the Asia Pacific region in this decade is
our effort to develop multiple new
arrangements to meet multiple threats and
opportunities. We have supported new
regional exchanges — such as the ASEAN
Regional Forum — on the full range of common
security challenges. These arrangements can
enhance regional security and understanding
through dialogue and transparency. These
regional exchanges are grounded on the
strong network of bilateral relationships
that exist today.

The continuing tensions on the Korean
Peninsula remain the principal threat to the
peace and stability of the Asian region. We
have worked assiduously with our South
Korean and Japanese allies, with the
People's Republic of China and with Russia
and with various UN organizations to resolve
the problem of North Korea's nuclear
program. We have also engaged in extensive
negotiations with the Pyongyang government
and have worked out an agreed framework for
replacing — over a ten-year period — North
Korea's dangerous, plutonium-producing
reactors with safer light water reactors.
That effort will be accompanied by a
willingness to improve bilateral political
and economic ties with the North,
commensurate with their continued
cooperation to resolve the nuclear issue and
to make progress on other issues of concern.
Our long run objective continues to be a
non-nuclear, peacefully reunified Korean
Peninsula. Our strong and active commitment
to our South Korean allies and to the region
is the foundation of this effort.

We are developing a broader engagement with
the People's Republic of China that will
encompass both our economic and strategic
interests. That policy is best reflected in
our decision to delink China's Most Favored
Nation status from its record on human
rights. We will also facilitate China's
entry into international trade
organizations, such as the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade if it undertakes the
necessary obligations. Given its growing
economic potential and already sizable
military force, it is essential that China
not become a security threat to the region.
To that end, we are strongly promoting
China's participation in regional security
mechanisms to reassure its neighbors and
assuage its own security concerns. We have
also broadened our bilateral security
dialogue with the Chinese and we are seeking
to gain further cooperation from China in
controlling the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction. We are also in the early
stages of a dialogue with China on
environmental and health challenges.

The second pillar of our engagement in Asia
is our commitment to continuing and
enhancing the economic prosperity that has
characterized the region. Opportunities for
economic progress continue to abound in
Asia, and underlie our strong commitment to
multilateral economic cooperation,
principally through APEC. Today, the 18
member states of APEC — comprising about
one-third of the world's population —
produce $14 trillion and export $1.7
trillion of goods annually, about one-half
of the world's totals. U.S. exports to APEC
economies reached $300 billion last year,
supporting nearly 2.6 million American jobs.
U.S. investments in the region totaled over
$140 million — about one-third of total U.S.
direct foreign investment. A prosperous and
open Asia Pacific is key to the economic
health of the United States. The first APEC
leaders meeting, hosted by President
Clinton, is vivid testimony to the
possibilities of stimulating regional
economic cooperation as we saw in the recent
APEC leaders statement at the second leaders
meeting that accepted the goal of free trade
within the region by early in the 21st
Century.

We are also working with our major bilateral
trade partners to improve trade relations.
The U.S. and Japan successfully completed a
preliminary accord in September to bring
about the implementation of the 1993
Framework Agreement, designed to open
Japan's markets more to competitive U.S.
goods and reduce the U.S. trade deficit.
Since we delinked China's Most -Favored-
Nation trade status from specific human
rights considerations in May,

U.S.-China trade has grown significantly.

We continue to work closely with Beijing to
resolve remaining bilateral and multilateral
trade problems, such as intellectual
property rights and market access. Unless
the issue of intellectual property rights is
resolved, economic sanctions will be
imposed.

The third pillar of our policy in building a
new Pacific community is to support
democratic reform in the region. The new
democratic states of Asia will have our
strong support as they move forward to
consolidate and expand democratic reforms.

Some have argued that democracy is somehow
unsuited for Asia or at least for some Asian
nations — that human rights are relative and
that they simply mask Western cultural
imperialism. These arguments are wrong. It
is not Western imperialism, but the
aspirations of Asian peoples themselves that
explain the growing number of democracies
and the growing strength of democracy
Movements everywhere in Asia. We support
those aspirations and those movements.

Each nation must find its own form of
democracy, and we respect the variety of
democratic institutions that have grown in
Asia. But there is no cultural
justification for torture or tyranny. Nor
do we accept repression cloaked in moral
relativism. Democracy and human rights are
universal yearnings and universal norms
just as powerful in Asia as elsewhere. We
will continue to press for respect for human
rights in countries as diverse as China and
Burma.

The Western Hemisphere

The Western hemisphere, too, is a fertile
field for a strategy of engagement and
enlargement. Sustained improvements in the
security situation there, including the
resolution of border tensions, control of
insurgencies and containment of pressures
for arms proliferation, will be an essential
underpinning of political and economic
progress in the hemisphere.

The unprecedented triumph of democracy and
market economies throughout the region
offers an unparalleled opportunity to secure
the benefits of peace and stability, and to
promote economic growth and trade. At the
Summit of the Americas, which President
Clinton hosted in

29

December, the 34 democratic nations of the
hemisphere committed themselves for the
first time to the goal of free trade in the
region. They also agreed to a detailed plan
of cooperative action in such diverse fields
as health, education, environmental
protection and the strengthening of
democratic institutions. To assure that
proposals in this plan are implemented, they
called for a series of follow-on ministerial
meetings over the next year and requested
the active participation of the Organization
of American States and the Inter-American
Development Bank. The Summit ushered ina
new era of hemispheric cooperation that
would not have been possible without U.S.
leadership and commitment.

NAFTA, ratified in December 1994, has
strengthened economic ties, with substantial
increases in U.S. exports to both Mexico and
Canada, creating new jobs and new
opportunities for American workers and
business. The United States, Mexico and
Canada have begun discussions to add Chile
to NAFTA.

We remain committed to extending democracy
to all of the region's people still blocked
from controlling their own destinies. Our
overarching objective is to preserve and
defend civilian elected governments and
strengthen democratic practices respectful
of human rights. Working with the
international community, we succeeded in
reversing the coup in Haiti and restoring
the democratically-elected president and
government. Our challenge now is to help
the Haitian people consolidate their
hard-won democracy and rebuild their
country. With the restoration of democracy
in Haiti, Cuba is the only country in the
hemisphere still ruled by a dictator. The
Cuban Democracy Act remains the framework
for our policy toward Cuba; our goal is the
peaceful establishment of democratic
governance for the people of Cuba.

We are working with our neighbors through
various hemispheric organizations, including
the OAS, to invigorate regional cooperation.
Both bilaterally and regionally, we seek to
eliminate the scourge of drug trafficking,
which poses a serious threat to democracy
and security. We also seek to strengthen
norms for defense establishments that are
supportive of democracy, respect for human
rights, and civilian control in defense
matters. Finally, protecting the region's
precious environmental resources is an
important priority.

30

The Middle East, Southwest
and South Asia

The United States has enduring interests in
the Middle East, especially pursuing a
comprehensive breakthrough to Middle East
peace, assuring the security of Israel and
our Arab friends, and maintaining the free
flow of oil at reasonable prices. Our
strategy is harnessed to the unique
characteristics of the region and our vital
interests there, as we work to extend the
range of peace and stability.

We have made solid progress in the past two
years. The President's efforts helped bring
about many historic firsts — the handshake
of peace between Prime Minister Rabin and
Chairman Arafat on the White House lawn has
been followed by the Jordan-Israel peace
treaty, progress on eliminating the Arab
boycott of Israel, and the establishment of
ties between Israel and an increasing number
of its Arab neighbors. But our efforts have
not stopped there; on other bilateral tracks
and through regional dialogue we are working
to foster a durable peace and a
comprehensive settlement, while our support
for economic development can bring hope to
all the peoples of the region.

In Southwest Asia, the United States remains
focused on deterring threats to regional
stability, particularly from Iraq and Iran
as long as those states pose a threat to
U.S. interests, to other states in the
region, and to their own citizens. We have
in place a dual containment strategy aimed
at these two states, and will maintain our
long-standing presence which has been
centered on naval vessels in and near the
Persian Gulf and prepositioned combat
equipment. Since Operation Desert Storm,
temporary deployments of land-based aviation
forces, ground forces and amphibious units
have supplemented our posture in the Gulf
region. Operation Vigilant Warrior
demonstrated our ability to rapidly
reinforce the region in time of crisis.

We have made clear to Iraq it must comply
with all the relevant Security Council
resolutions, and we remain committed to
supporting oppressed minorities in Iraq
through Operations Provide Comfort and
Southern Watch. Our policy is directed not
against the people of Iraq, but against the
aggressive behavior of the government. The
October 1994 deployment, Vigilant Warrior
demonstrated again the need and our ability
to respond quickly to threats to our allies.

Our policy toward Iran is aimed at changing
the behavior of the Iranian government in
several key areas, including Iran's efforts
to obtain weapons of mass destruction and
missiles, its support for terrorism and
groups that oppose the peace process, its
attempts to undermine friendly governments
in the region and its dismal human rights
record. We remain willing to enter into an
authoritative dialogue with Iran to discuss
the differences between us.

A key objective of our policy in the Gulf is
to reduce the chances that another aggressor
will emerge who would threaten the
independence of existing states. Therefore,
we will continue to encourage members of the
Gulf Cooperation Council to work closely on
collective defense and security
arrangements, help individual GCC states
meet their appropriate defense requirements
and maintain our bilateral defense
agreements.

South Asia has experienced an important
expansion of democracy and economic reform,
and our strategy is designed to help the
peoples of that region enjoy the fruits of
democracy and greater stability through
efforts aimed at resolving long-standing
conflict and implementing confidence
building measures. The United States has
engaged India and Pakistan in seeking
agreement on steps to cap, reduce, and
ultimately eliminate their weapons of mass
destruction and ballistic missile
capabilities. Regional stability and
improved bilateral ties are also important
for America's economic interest in a region
that contains a quarter of the world's
population and one of its most important
emerging markets.

In both the Middle East and South Asia, the
pressure of expanding populations on natural
resources is enormous. Growing
desertification in the Middle East has
strained relations over arable land.
Pollution of the coastal areas in the
Eastern Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the
Gulf of Aqaba has degraded fish catches and
hindered development. Water shortages
stemming from overuse, contaminated water
aquifers and riparian disputes threaten
regional relations. In South Asia, high
population densities and rampant pollution
have exacted a tremendous toll on forests,
biodiversity and the local environment.

Africa

Africa poses one of our greatest challenges
and opportunities to enlarge the community
of market democracies. Throughout Africa,
U.S. policy supports democracy, sustainable
economic development and resolution of
conflicts through negotiation, diplomacy and
peacekeeping. New policies will strengthen
civil societies and mechanisms for conflict
resolution, particularly where ethnic,
religious, and political tensions are acute.
In particular, we will seek to identify and
address the root causes of conflicts and
disasters before they erupt.

The nexus of economic, political, social,
ethnic and environmental challenges facing
Africa can lead to a sense of
""Afro-pessimism."" However, if we can
simultaneously address these challenges, we
create a synergy that can stimulate
development, resurrect societies and build
hope. We encourage democratic reform in
nations like Nigeria and Zaire to allow the
people of these countries to enjoy
responsive government. In Mozambique and
Angola, we have played a leading role in
bringing an end to two decades of civil war
and promoting national reconciliation. For
the first time, there is the prospect that
all of southern Africa could enjoy the
fruits of peace and prosperity. Throughout
the continent — in Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia,
Sudan and elsewhere — we work with the UN
and regional organizations to encourage
peaceful resolution of internal disputes.

 

Last year, South Africa held its first
non-racial elections and created a
Government of National Unity. We remain
committed to addressing the socio-economic
legacies of apartheid to ensure that
democracy fully takes root in South Africa.
During the state visit of Nelson Mandela, we
announced formation of a bilateral
commission to foster new cooperation between
our nations. We must support the revolution
of democracy sweeping the continent — on
center stage in South Africa, and in quieter
but no less dramatic ways in countries like
Malawi, Benin, Niger, and Mali. We need to
encourage the creation of cultures of
tolerance, flowering of civil society and
the protection of human rights and human
dignity.

31

Our humanitarian interventions, along with
the international community, will address
the grave circumstances in several nations
on the continent. USAID's new ""Greater Horn
of Africa"" initiative got ahead of the curve
on a potential famine that threatened 25
million people, and moved beyond relief to
support reconstruction and sustainable
development. In Somalia, our forces broke
through the chaos that prevented the
introduction of relief supplies. U.S.
forces prevented the death of hundreds of
thousands of Somalis and then turned over
the mission to UN peacekeepers from over a
score of nations. In Rwanda, Sudan, Angola
and Liberia, we have taken an active role in
providing humanitarian relief to those
displaced by violence.

Such efforts by the U.S. and the
international community must be limited in
duration and designed to give the peoples of
a nation the opportunity to put their own
house in order. In the final analysis, the
responsibility for the fate of a nation
rests with its own people.

We are also working with regional
organizations, nongovernmental organizations
and governments throughout Africa to address
the urgent issues of population growth,

32

spreading disease (including AIDS),
environmental decline, enhancing the role of
women in development, eliminating support
for terrorism, demobilization of bloated
militaries, relieving burdensome debt, and
expanding trade and investment ties to the
countries of Africa.

Central to all these efforts will be
strengthening the American constituency for
Africa, drawing on the knowledge, experience
and commitment of millions of Americans to
enhance our nation's support for positive
change in Africa. For example, the white
House Conference on Africa, the first such
gathering of regional experts ever sponsored
by the White House, drew together more than
200 Americans from the Administration
Congress, business, labor, academia,
religious groups, relief and development
agencies, human rights groups and others to
discuss Africa's future and the role that
the United States can play in it. The
President, Vice President, Secretary of
State and National Security Advisor all
participated in the conference, which
produced a wealth of new ideas and new
commitment to Africa.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The clear and present dangers of the Cold
War made the need for national security
commitments and expenditures obvious to the
American people. Today the task of
mobilizing public support for national
security priorities has become more
complicated. The complex array of new
dangers, opportunities and responsibilities
outlined in this strategy come at a moment
in our history when Americans are
preoccupied with domestic concerns and when
budgetary constraints are tighter than at
any point in the last half century. Yet, in
a more integrated and interdependent world
we simply cannot be successful in advancing
our interests — political, military and
economic — without active engagement in
world affairs.

While Cold war threats have diminished, our
nation can never again isolate itself from
global developments. Domestic renewal will
not succeed if we fail to engage abroad in
open foreign markets, to promote democracy
in key countries, and to counter and contain
emerging threats.

We are committed to enhancing U.S. national
security in the most efficient and effective
ways possible. We recognize that
Maintaining peace and ensuring our national
security in a volatile world are expensive.
The cost of any other course of action,
however, would be immeasurably higher

Our engagement abroad requires the active,
sustained bipartisan support of the American
people and the U.S. Congress. Of all the
elements contained in this strategy, none is
more important than this: our Administration
is committed to explaining our security
interests and objectives to the nation; to
seeking the broadest possible public and
congressional support for our security
programs and investments; and to exerting
our leadership in the world in a manner that
reflects our best national values and
protects the security of this great and good
nation.

Preface

Protecting our nation’s security — our people, our territory
and our way of life — is my Administration's foremost
mission and constitutional duty. America’s security impera-
tives, however, have fundamentally changed. The central
security challenge of the past half century — the threat of
communist expansion — is gone. The dangers we face
today are more diverse. Ethnic conflict is spreading and
rogue states pose a serious danger to regional stability in
many corners of the globe. The proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction represents a major challenge to our secu-
rity. Large-scale environmental degradation, exacerbated
by rapid population growth, threatens to undermine polit-
ical stability in many countries and regions. And the threat
to our open and free society from the organized forces of
terrorism, international crime and drug trafficking is greater
as the technological revolution, which holds such promise,
also empowers these destructive forces with novel means
to challenge our security. These threats to our security
have no respect for boundaries and it is clear that
American security in the 21st Century will be determined
by the success of our response to forces that operate within
as well as beyond our borders.

At the same time, we have unprecedented opportunities to
make our nation safer and more prosperous. Our military
might is unparalleled. We now have a truly global
economy linked by an instantaneous communications
network, which offers increasing opportunities for
American jobs and American investment. The community
of democratic nations is growing, enhancing the prospects
for political stability, peaceful conflict resolution, and
greater dignity and hope for the people of the world. The
international community is beginning to act together to
address pressing global environmental needs.

 

Never has American leadership been more essential — to
navigate the shoals of the world’s new dangers and to

 

capitalize on its opportunities. American assets are unique:

our military strength, our dynamic economy, our powerful
ideals and, above all, our people. We can and must make
the difference through our engagement; but our involve-
ment must be carefully tailored to serve our interests and
priorities.

This report, submitted in accordance with Section 603 of
the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Department
Reorganization Act of 1986, elaborates a national security
strategy that is tailored for this new era and builds upon
America’s unmatched strengths. Focusing on new threats
and new opportunities, its central goals are:

¢ To enhance our security with military forces that are
ready to fight and with effective representation
abroad.

* To bolster America’s economic revitalization.
* To promote democracy abroad.

Over the past three years, my Administration has worked
diligently to pursue these goals. This national security
strategy report presents the strategy that has guided this
effort. It is premised on a belief that the line between our
domestic and foreign policies is disappearing — that we
must revitalize our economy if we are to sustain our mili-
tary forces, foreign initiatives and global influence, and
that we must engage actively abroad if we are to open
foreign markets and create jobs for our people.

We believe that our goals of enhancing our security,
bolstering our economic prosperity and promoting democ-
racy are mutually supportive. Secure nations are more
likely to support free trade and maintain democratic struc-
tures. Free market nations with growing economies and
strong and open trade ties are more likely to feel secure
and to work toward freedom. And democratic states are
less likely to threaten our interests and more likely to coop-
erate with the United States to meet security threats and
promote free trace and sustainable development. These
goals are supported by ensuring America remains engaged
in the world and by enlarging the community of secure,
free market and democratic nations.

As the boundaries between threats that start outside our
borders and the challenges from within are diminishing,
the problems others face today can more quickly become
ours, tomorrow. This is why U.S. leadership and our
engagement have never been more important: if we with-
draw from this world today, our citizens will have to pay
the price of our neglect. We therefore measure the success
of our efforts abroad, as at home, by one simple standard:
Have we made the lives of the American people safer,
today; have we made tomorrow better and more secure for
our children?

Since my Administration began, we have been deeply
engaged in efforts to realize this measure of success by
meeting the goals of our strategy:

* To enhance our security, for example, we have
helped achieve peace between Jordan and Israel and
an Interim Agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians in the Middle East; brokered a compre-
hensive peace agreement in Bosnia and successfully
deterred the spread of conflict to the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; established
NATO's Partnership for Peace and initiated a process
that will lead to NATO's enlargement; concluded an
agreement with Russia to detarget ICBMs and SLBMs;
secured the accession of Ukraine, Kazakstan, and
Belarus to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
and their agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons
from their territory, which in turn opened the door to
the ratification and entry into force of the START |
Treaty and Senate advice and consent to the ratifica-
tion of the START II Treaty; led successful interna-
tional efforts to secure the indefinite and uncondi-
tional extension of the NPT; initiated negotiations on

 

a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT), which we
hope to conclude in 1996; participated in an
unprecedented regional security gathering of the
ASEAN countries and others, including Russia and
Vietnam; reached an Agreed Framework with North
Korea that halted, and will eventually eliminate, its
dangerous nuclear program; and used our diplo-
matic support and the power of our example to give
new impetus to the efforts of the people of Northern
Ireland and the British and Irish governments to
achieve a just and lasting settlement to the conflict
there.

* To bolster prosperity at home and around the world,
we have secured the enactment of legislation imple-
menting both the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) and the Uruguay Round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT);
completed over 80 separate trade agreements;
actively engaged China on trade issues through
extension of its Most Favored Nation status and
vigorous pursuit of China’s adherence to the rules-
based regime of the World Trade Organization;
worked to open Asia-Pacific markets through three
leaders meetings of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum; lowered export controls; and
held a Western Hemisphere Summit in Miami where
the 34 democratic nations of this hemisphere
committed themselves to negotiate a free-trade
agreement by 2005.

* To promote democracy, we have supported South
Africa’s recent transformation; provided aid to a
democratizing Russia and other new independent
states of the former Soviet Union as well as Central
and Eastern European nations; assisted Cambodia;
advocated improvements in human rights globally
through the UN urging that the rule of law replace
the rule of oppressive regimes; and worked with our
Western Hemisphere neighbors restoring the democ-
ratically elected government in Haiti and hosting the
Summit of the Americas, which reaffirmed and
strengthened our mutual commitment to democracy.

Our extraordinary diplomatic leverage to reshape existing
security and economic structures and create new ones ulti-
mately relies upon American power. Our economic and
military might, as well as the power of our ideals, also
makes America’s diplomats the first among equals and

 

 

enables us to help create the conditions necessary for U.S.
interests to thrive. Our economic strength gives us a posi-
tion of advantage on almost every global issue. For
instance, our efforts in South Africa and our negotiations
with North Korea demonstrate how the imposition — or
the threat — of economic sanctions helps us to achieve
our objectives as part of our determined diplomacy. That
determined diplomacy also is reflected in our consistent
effort to engage in productive relations with China across a
broad range of issues, including regional security, nonpro-
liferation, human rights and trade. We seek a strategic rela-
tionship with China, advancing our own national interests
in key areas. It is this steady approach — asserting
America’s core national security interests while keeping in
mind longer-term goals —— that is the hallmark of deter-
mined diplomacy.

But military force remains an indispensable element of our
nation’s power. Our nation must maintain military forces
sufficient to deter diverse threats and, when necessary, to
fight and win against our adversaries. While many factors
ultimately contribute to our nation’s safety and well-being,
no single component is more important than the men and
women who wear America’s uniform and stand sentry
over our security. Their skill, service and dedication consti-
tute the core of our defenses. Today our military is the
best-equipped, best-trained and best-prepared fighting
force in the world. Time after time in the last three years,
our troops demonstrated their continued readiness and
strength: moving with lightning speed to head off another
Iraqi threat to Kuwait; helping to save hundreds of thou-
sands of lives in Rwanda; giving freedom and democracy
back to the people of Haiti; and helping enforce UN
mandates in the former Yugoslavia and subsequently
deploying forces under NATO command to help imple-
ment the peace agreement in Bosnia. | am committed to
ensuring that this military capability is not compromised.

The United States recognizes that we have a special
responsibility that goes along with being a great power
and, at times, our global interests and ideals lead us to
oppose those who would endanger the survival or well-
being of their peaceful neighbors. At the same time, all
nations should be able to expect that their borders and
their sovereignty will always be secure; however, this does
not mean we or the international community must tolerate
gross violations of human rights within those borders.

When our national security interests are threatened, we
will, as America always has, use diplomacy when we can,

 

but force if we must. We will act with others when we
can, but alone when we must. We recognize, however,
that while force can defeat an aggressor, it cannot solve
underlying problems. Democracy and economic prosperity
can take root in a struggling society only through local
solutions carried out by the society itself. We must use
military force selectively, recognizing that its use may do
no more than provide a window of opportunity for a
society — and diplomacy — to work.

We therefore will send American troops abroad only when
our interests and our values are sufficiently at stake. The
courage, loyalty and willingness of our men and women in
uniform to put their lives at risk is a national treasure
which should never be taken for granted, but neither
should we fear to employ U.S. military forces wisely.
When we do so, it will be with clear objectives to which
we are firmly committed and which — when combat is
likely — we have the means to achieve decisively. To do
otherwise, risks those objectives and endangers our troops.
These requirements are as pertinent for humanitarian and
other nontraditional interventions today as they were for
previous generations during prolonged world wars.
Modern media communications may now bring to our
homes both the suffering that exists in many parts of the
world and the casualties that may accompany interven-
tions to help. But no deployment of American service
members is risk-free, and we must remain clear in our
purpose and resolute in its execution. And while we must
continue to reassess the costs and benefits of any operation
as it unfolds, reflexive calls for withdrawal of our forces
when casualties are incurred would simply encourage
rogue actors to try to force our departure from areas where
there are U.S. interests by attacking American troops.

During the past three years, diplomacy backed by
American power has produced impressive results:

¢ When Iraq moved forces towards Kuwait, we reacted
swiftly and dispatched additional, large-scale forces
to the region under the authority of the United
Nations — but were prepared to act alone, if neces-

sary.

¢ In Haiti, it was only when the Haitian military
learned that the 82nd Airborne Division was en route
that we achieved peacefully what we were prepared
to do under fire.

 

* In Bosnia, we achieved a breakthrough when U.S.
diplomatic leadership was married to appropriate
military power. After the fall of Zepa and Srebrenica,
the United States secured an agreement from our
NATO allies to meet further assaults on the UN safe
areas with a decisive military response. American
pilots participated in the NATO bombing campaign
following the shelling of a Sarajevo marketplace,
demonstrating our resolve and helping to bring the
parties to the negotiating table.

U.S. leadership then seized the opportunity for peace
that these developments created: U.S. diplomats,
along with our Contact Group partners, brokered a
cease-fire and, after intensive U.S.-led negotiations in
Dayton, Ohio, a comprehensive peace agreement.
U.S. forces are now working as part of a larger
NATO force — joined by forces from members of
NATO’s Partnership for Peace — to help implement
the military aspects of the agreement and create the
conditions for peace to take hold.

¢ In Rwanda and Somalia, only the American military
could have accomplished what it did in these
humanitarian missions, saving hundreds of thousands
of lives. However, over the longer run our interests
were served by turning these operations over to
multilateral peacekeeping forces once the immediate
humanitarian crisis was addressed. No outside force
can create a stable and legitimate domestic order for
another society — that work can only be accom-
plished by the society itself.

Our national security strategy reflects both America’s inter-
ests and our values. Our commitment to freedom, equality
and human dignity continues to serve as a beacon of hope
to peoples around the world. The vitality, creativity and
diversity of American society are important sources of
national strength in a global economy increasingly driven
by information and ideas.

 

Our prospects in this new era are promising. The specter of
nuclear annihilation has dramatically receded. The historic
events of the past three years — including the handshake
between Israel and the PLO, the peace treaty between
Israel and Jordan, the transformation of South Africa to a
multiracial democracy headed by President Mandela and
the peace agreement to end the war in Bosnia — suggest
this era’s possibilities for achieving security, prosperity and
democracy.

Our nation can only address this era’s dangers and oppor-
tunities if we remain actively engaged in global affairs. We
are the world’s greatest power, and we have global inter-
ests as well as responsibilities. As our nation learned after
World War I, we can find no security for America in isola-
tionism nor prosperity in protectionism. For the American
people to be safer and enjoy expanding opportunities, our
nation must work to deter would-be aggressors, open
foreign markets, promote the spread of democracy abroad,
combat transnational dangers of terrorism, drug trafficking
and international crime, encourage sustainable develop-
ment and pursue new opportunities for peace.

Our national security requires the patient application of
American will and resources. We can only sustain that
necessary investment with the broad, bipartisan support of
the American people and their representatives in Congress.
The full participation of Congress is essential to the success
of our continuing engagement, and | will consult with
members of Congress at every step as we formulate and
implement American foreign policy.

The need for American leadership abroad remains as
strong as ever. | am committed to forging a new public
consensus to sustain our active engagement abroad in
pursuit of our cherished goal — a more secure world
where democracy and free markets know no borders. This
document details that commitment.

|. Introduction

When this Administration assumed office, the United States
and its allies faced a radically transformed security envi-
ronment. The primary security imperative of the past half
century — containing communist expansion while
preventing nuclear war — was gone. Instead, we
confronted a complex array of new and old security chal-
lenges America had to meet as we approached the 21st
century.

The Administration outlined a national security strategy
that assessed America’s role in this new international
context and described a strategy to advance our interests at
home and abroad.

The strategy recognized that the United States was facing a
period of great promise but also great uncertainty. We
stand as the world’s preeminent power. America’s core
value of freedom, as embodied in democratic governance
and market economics, has gained ground around the
world. Hundreds of millions of people have thrown off
communism, dictatorship or apartheid. Former adversaries
now work with us in diplomacy and global problem
solving. Both the threat of a war among great powers and
the specter of nuclear annihilation have receded dramati-
cally. The dynamism of the global economy is trans-
forming commerce, culture and global politics, promising
greater prosperity for America and greater cooperation
among nations.

At the same time, troubling uncertainties and clear threats
remain. The new, independent states that replaced the
Soviet Union continue to experience wrenching economic
and political transitions, while the progress of the many
new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe is still

 

fragile. While our relations with the other great powers are
as constructive as at any point in this century, Russia’s
historic transformation will face difficult challenges, and
China maintains an authoritative regime even as that
country assumes a more important economic and political
role in global affairs. The spread of weapons of mass
destruction poses serious threats, and rogue states still
threaten regional aggression. Violent extremists threaten
fragile peace processes in many parts of the world.
Worldwide, there is a resurgence of militant nationalism as
well as ethnic and religious conflict. This has been demon-
strated by the upheavals in Bosnia, Rwanda and Somalia,
where the United States has participated in peacekeeping
and humanitarian missions.

The strategy also recognized that a number of transna-
tional problems which once seemed quite distant, like
environmental degradation, natural resource depletion,
rapid population growth and refugee flows, now pose
threats to our prosperity and have security implications for
both present and long-term American policy. In addition,
the emergence of the information and technology age
presents new challenges to U.S. strategy even as it offers
extraordinary opportunities to build a better future. This
technology revolution brings our world closer together as
information, money and ideas move around the globe at
record speed; but it also makes possible for the violence of
terrorism, organized crime and drug trafficking to chal-
lenge the security of our borders and that of our citizens in
new ways.

It is a world where clear distinctions between threats to
our nation’s security from beyond our borders and the
challenges to our security from within our borders are

being blurred; where the separation between international
problems and domestic ones is evaporating; and where the
line between domestic and foreign policy is eroding. The
demise of communism not only lifted the lid on age-old
conflicts but it opened the door to new dangers, such as
the spread of weapons of mass destruction to non-state, as
well as state, forces. And it did so at a time when these
forces can now try to threaten our security from within our
borders because of their access to modern technology. We
must therefore assess these forces for what they are, with
our response based on the nature of their threat, not just
where they occur.

Because problems that start beyond our borders can now
much more easily become problems within them,
American leadership and engagement in the world has
never been more important. There is also a simple truth
about this new world: the same idea that was under attack
three times in this century — first by imperialism and then
by fascism and communism — remains under attack
today, but on many fronts at once. It is an idea that comes
under many names — democracy, liberty, civility,
pluralism — but which together are the values of a society
where leaders and governments preserve individual free-
doms and ensure opportunity and human dignity. As the
President has said, “We face a contest as old as history —
a struggle between freedom and tyranny; between toler-
ance and isolation. It is a fight between those who would
build free societies governed by laws and those who
would impose their will by force. Our struggle today, in a
world more high-tech, more fast-moving, more chaotically
diverse than ever, is the age-old fight between hope and
fear.” Just as surely as fascism and communism once did,
so, too, are our freedom, democracy, security and pros-
perity now threatened by regional aggressors and the
spread of weapons of mass destruction; ethnic, religious
and national rivalries; and the forces of terrorism, drug traf-
ficking and international organized crime. Today,
addressing these threats demands American leadership.

The victors of World War | squandered their triumph in
this age-old struggle when they turned inward, bringing on
a global depression and allowing fascism to rise, and
reigniting global war. After World War II, we remembered
the lessons of the past. In the face of a new totalitarian
threat, this great nation did not walk away from the chal-
lenge of the moment. Instead, it chose to reach out, to
rebuild international security structures and to lead. This
determination of previous generations to prevail over

 

 

communism by shaping new international structures left us
a world stronger, safer and freer. It is this example and its
success that now inspire us to continue the difficult task of
a new stage in this old struggle: to secure the peace won in
the Cold War against those who would still deny people
their human rights, terrorists who threaten innocents and
pariah states who choose repression and extremism over
openness and moderation.

By exerting our leadership abroad, we make America safer
and more prosperous — by deterring aggression, by
fostering the peaceful resolution of dangerous conflicts, by
opening foreign markets, by helping democratic regimes
and by tackling global problems. Without our active lead-
ership and engagement abroad, threats will fester and our
opportunities will narrow. We seek to be as creative and
constructive — in the literal sense of that word — as the
generation of the late 1940's. For all its dangers, this new
world presents an immense opportunity — the chance to
adapt and construct global institutions that will help to
provide security and increase economic growth for
America and the world.

At issue is whether our efforts at this construction can
continue to succeed in the face of shifting threats to the
ideals and habits of democracy. It is therefore in our
interest that democracy be at once the foundation and the
purpose of the international structures we build through
this constructive diplomacy: the foundation, because the
institutions will be a reflection of their shared values and
norms; the purpose, because if political and economic
institutions are secure, democracy will flourish.

Promoting democracy does more than foster our ideals. It
advances our interests because we know that the larger the
pool of democracies, the better off we, and the entire
community of nations, will be. Democracies create free
markets that offer economic opportunity, make for more
reliable trading partners and are far less likely to wage war
on one another. While democracy will not soon take hold
everywhere, it is in our interest to do all that we can to
enlarge the community of free and open societies, espe-
cially in areas of greatest strategic interest, as in Central
and Eastern Europe and the new independent states of the
former Soviet Union.

Our national security strategy is therefore based on
enlarging the community of market democracies while
deterring and limiting a range of threats to our nation, our

 

 

allies and our interests. The more that democracy and
political and economic liberalization take hold in the
world, particularly in countries of strategic importance to
us, the safer our nation is likely to be and the more our
people are likely to prosper.

To that broad end, the three central components of our
strategy of engagement and enlargement are: (1) our efforts
to enhance our security by maintaining a strong defense
capability and employing effective diplomacy to promote
cooperative security measures; (2) our work to open
foreign markets and spur global economic growth; and (3)
our promotion of democracy abroad. It also explains how
we are pursuing these elements of our strategy in specific
regions by adapting and constructing institutions that will
help to provide security and increase economic growth
throughout the world.

In a democracy, however, the foreign policy and security
strategy of the nation must serve the needs of the people.
The preamble of the Constitution sets out the basic objec-
tives:

provide for the common defence, promote the
general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to
ourselves and our posterity.

The end of the Cold War does not alter these fundamental
purposes. Nor does it reduce the need for active American
efforts, here and abroad, to pursue those goals. Our efforts
to advance the common good at home depend upon our
efforts to advance our interests around the world.
Therefore, we must judge the success of our security
strategy by its impact on the domestic lives of our citizens:
has it made a real difference in the day to day lives of
Americans? Consider just a few examples:

Every American today is safer because we are stepping
back from the nuclear precipice. Russian missiles are no

, longer targeted at the United States and we have
convinced Ukraine, Kazakstan and Belarus to give up
nuclear weapons left on their land when the Soviet Union
collapsed, American leadership secured the indefinite and
unconditional extension of the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty
and we convinced North Korea to freeze its nuclear
program. Our strategy also continues to ensure the safe-
guarding of more nuclear materials so they do not fall into
the hands of terrorists or international criminals and
endanger our citizens.

 

 

tn a world where the boundaries between threats outside
our borders and the challenges from within are dimin-
ishing, Americans are safer because our counterterrorism
strategy promoted closer cooperation with foreign govern-
ments and sanctions against states that sponsor terrorism,
while increasing the resources for our own law enforce-
ment agencies.

Large-scale migration from Haiti has been stemmed
because we gave democracy another chance in that
nation. In the months before we forced the military rulers
to step down, 16,000 Haitians fled their country for our
shores and elsewhere in the region. Three months after the
intervention, the refugee flow was practically zero.

Our strategy to help the nations of Central Europe consoli-
date democracy, find lasting security and build strong
economics makes it much less likely that Americans might
have to fight another war on the battlegrounds of Europe.
By supporting democratic reform and the transition to free
markets in the new independent states of the former Soviet
Union and in Central Europe, our strategy promoted
stability and prosperity in an area that will become a vast
market for the United States, creating jobs in America. In
Bosnia, diplomatic determination combined with military
muscle to create an opportunity to secure a peace rather
than permit instability to undermine this fragile region and
U.S. interests.

Our strategy’s trade initiatives, from NAFTA and the
Uruguay Round of GATT to over 80 separate trade agree-
ments, have created more than two million American jobs.
With the Summit of the Americas and the APEC process,
U.S. exports — and jobs — will continue to grow. Because
of our emergency assistance to Mexico during its financial
crisis, economic growth — although fragile — has returned
and exports now exceed pre-NAFTA levels. Mexico has
begun repaying its debt to the United States ahead of
schedule, protecting the nearly 310,000 American jobs
NAFTA has already created because of exports to our
partners.

From lraq to Haiti, South Africa to the Korean Peninsula,
the Middle East to Northern Ireland, our strategy has
stopped or prevented war and brought former adversaries
together in peace because it is in our interest. These efforts,
combined with assisting developing nations who are
fighting overpopulation, AIDS, drug smuggling and envi-
ronmental degradation, ensure that future generations of

Americans will not have to contend with the consequences
of neglecting these threats to our security and prosperity.

Many of these decisions were made in the face of signifi-
cant disagreement over what needed to be done at the
moment. But the alternatives bore unacceptable costs to
our citizens: tariffs and barriers would still cripple the
world trading system if not for GATT and NAFTA; the
Persian Gulf region would be very different today if the
rapid response of the United States and its allies had not
deterred Iraq's threatened aggression against Kuwait in
1994; the flood of Haitian refugees at our borders would
have continued had we not intervened in that country;
Latin America would have seen financial and economic
chaos affecting its fragile democracies, and U.S. trade
would have been harmed, had we not moved to help
stabilize Mexico’s economy; and the dangers to our people
from weapons of mass destruction would be much greater
had our strategy not reduced the threat of nuclear arms,
curbed the spread of chemical and biological weapons
around the world and countered the terrorists and crimi-
nals who would endanger us if they possessed these
weapons. The money we devoted to development, peace-
keeping or disaster relief helped to avert future crises
whose cost would have been far greater in terms of lives
lost and resources spent.

We can continue to engage actively abroad to achieve
these results only if the American people and the Congress
are willing to bear the costs of that leadership — in dollars,
political energy and, at times, American lives. U.S. secu-
rity, prosperity and freedom are neither cost- nor risk-free;
resources must be spent and casualties may be incurred.
One purpose of this report is to help foster the broad,
bipartisan understanding and support necessary to sustain
our international engagement. A coalition of the center
through bipartisan congressional participation is critical to
this commitment. Some decisions must be made in the
face of opposition; these decisions must ultimately be
judged as to whether they benefited the American people
by advancing their interests of security, prosperity and
democracy in the jong run.

During the first three years of this Administration, this
strategy has produced the following results with respect to
our security requirements:

* Atthe President's direction, the Pentagon conducted
the Bottom Up Review and Nuclear Posture Review,

 

 

assessing what defense forces and capabilities our
nation needs for this new security era. The
Administration’s defense strategy, which requires
U.S. forces to be able to deter and, if necessary,
defeat aggression in concert with regional allies in
two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts, has
proved realistic. In the late summer of 1994, we
faced the very real prospect of near-simultaneous
hostilities with North Korea and Iraq. Our rapid rein-
forcement of U.S. military presence and additional
deployments to these theaters deterred potential
aggression. Our military’s superb performance in
responding quickly and effectively when called upon
in these crises, as well as in those in Haiti and
Rwanda that same year, clearly demonstrates their
continued readiness to respond as needed and that
we have prudently managed the post-Cold War force
drawdown.

The President also set forth a defense budget for
Fiscal Years 1996-2001 which fully funds the force
structure recommended by the Bottom Up and
uclear Posture Reviews and which is necessary to
carry out the national security strategy. He repeatedly
stressed that he will draw the line against further cuts
hat would undermine that force structure or erode
U.S. military readiness. The President also requested
Congress to enact supplemental appropriations of
$1.7 billion for FY 1994 and $ 2.6 billion for FY

995 to ensure readiness would not be impaired by
the costs of unanticipated contingencies. In addition,
the President added $25 billion to the Fiscal Year
996-2001 defense spending plan to provide more
funding for readiness, modernization and quality of
life improvements for our military personnel and
families. The President also agreed to extra funding in
the FY 1996 Defense appropriations bill in order to
pay for the troop deployment in Bosnia.

 

The United States initiated an intense diplomatic
effort that forged a Bosnia-wide cease-fire and then
brokered a comprehensive peace agreement among
the parties. We contributed a substantial share of the
NATO-led peace implementation force to help
implement the military aspects of the peace agree-
ment and create the conditions for peace to take
hold.

 

 

© At President Clinton’s initiative, a NATO Summit in

January 1994 approved the Partnership For Peace
(PFP) program and initiated a process that will lead
to NATO’s gradual enlargement to ensure that the
alliance is prepared to meet the European and
transatlantic security challenges of this era, and to
provide the security relationships that will buttress
the underpinnings for the democratic and market
economic gains in Europe since 1989. Since the
Summit, 27 countries, including Russia, agreed to
join the Partnership for Peace, and Partner countries
are now working with NATO in Bosnia. In 1995,
NATO completed work on its enlargement study and
presented it to the Partners. This year, in the second
phase of the enlargement process, NATO will begin
intensive bilateral consultations with all the PFP
members who wish to participate, aimed at helping
them prepare for possible NATO membership.

The United States, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and
Kazakstan exchanged instruments of ratification for
the START | Treaty at the December 1994 summit of
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe (CSCE), culminating two years of intensive
U.S. diplomatic efforts to bring the Treaty into force
and paving the way for ratification of the 1993
START II Treaty. START | requires the permanent
elimination of bombers, !CBM silos and ballistic
missile submarine launch tubes that carried over
9,000 of the 21,000 total accountable warheads the
United States and the former Soviet Union declared
when the Treaty was signed — a reduction of 40
percent. START II, which the Senate voted 87-4 to
give its advice and consent to ratification on January
26, 1996, will eliminate additional U.S. and Russian
strategic launchers and will effectively remove an
additional 5,000 deployed warheads, leaving each
side with no more than 3,500. These actions will
reduce the deployed strategic force arsenals of the
United States and Russia by two-thirds. Presidents
Clinton and Yeltsin have agreed that once START II is
ratified by both countries, the United States and
Russia will begin immediately to deactivate all
strategic nuclear delivery systems to be reduced
under the Treaty by removing their nuclear warheads
or taking other steps to take them out of combat
status, thus removing thousands of warheads from
alert status years ahead of schedule. The two
Presidents also directed an intensification of dialogue

 

regarding the possibility of further reductions of, and
limitations on, remaining nuclear forces.

The 30-nation Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE)
Treaty’s reduction period came to an end this past
November, resulting in the elimination of over
50,000 pieces of heavy military equipment and
capping conventional forces in Europe at their lowest
levels in decades. Together with our allies, the
Administration will continue to pursue full imple-
mentation of this agreement.

The President launched a comprehensive policy to
combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruc-
tion and the missiles that deliver them. The United
States has secured landmark commitments to elimi-
nate all nuclear weapons from Ukraine, Belarus and
Kazakstan, and in December 1994, Ukraine formally
acceded to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty as a
non-nuclear weapon state, as Kazakstan and Belarus
had done previously. By the end of 1995, all nuclear
weapons had been removed from Kazakstan, most
were out of Belarus and a significant number had
been transferred from Ukraine. The United States led
the successful international effort to extend the NPT
indefinitely and without conditions by consensus of
Treaty parties at the 1995 Review and Extension
Conference. The President’s August 1995 initiative to
support a true zero yield Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) provided a significant boost to the
CTBT negotiations and has opened the door to
completing and signing a CTBT in 1996.

We also made significant progress during the past
year in negotiations to establish an agreed demarca-
tion between strategic and theater ballistic missiles
that will update the ABM Treaty and advance our
goal of deploying advanced theater missile defenses.
The Administration also submitted the Chemical
Weapons Convention to the Senate for its advice and
consent to ratification and supported the develop-
ment of new measures to strengthen the Biological
Weapons Convention.

The Administration reached an important Agreed
Framework with North Korea that has halted and,
when fully implemented, will eventually eliminate
that country’s existing, dangerous nuclear program,
greatly enhancing regional stability and advancing

our nonproliferation goals. The Administration
reached agreements with Russia, Ukraine and South
Africa to control missile-related technology, brought
Russia, Brazil and South Africa into the Missile
Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and secured
China’s commitment not to transfer MTCR-
controlled, ground-to-ground missiles. The United
States has also fed international efforts to create the
multilateral “Wassenaar Arrangement on Export
Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-use Goods
and Technology” — the successor to the
Coordinating Committee for East-West Trade
(COCOM) — to provide a regime for transparency
and restraint on dangerous transfers of conventional
arms and dual-use technologies.

The President's efforts helped bring about many
historic firsts in the Middle East peace process — the
handshake of peace between Prime Minister Rabin
and Chairman Arafat on the White House lawn has
been followed by the Jordan-Israel peace treaty, the
Israel-Palestinian Interim Agreement, progress on
eliminating the Arab boycott of Israel and the estab-
lishment of ties between Israel and an increasing
number of its Arab neighbors.

In 1995, the President proposed legislation to provide
law enforcement officials with increased tools to
combat terrorism. These include additional
manpower and training, methods to mark and trace
explosives and legal mobile wiretaps. The President
also directed new initiatives against money-laun-
dering, for seizing the assets of drug rings and for
new legislation to respond more effectively to orga-
nized crime activity. In October, the President also
announced at the United Nations an invitation to
every country to join in negotiating an international
declaration on citizens’ security that would include:
a no-sanctuary pledge for organized criminals, terror-
ists, drug traffickers and smugglers; a counterter-
rorism pact; a pledge to end the trafficking of illegal
arms and of lethal nuclear, biological and chemical
materials; an antinarcotics pledge; and an effective
police force partnership to help combat these forces
of violence and destruction. Progress has been made,
with the apprehension of leaders of the most influen-
tial South American drug cartels.

 

* In March 1995, the President obtained Senate advice
and consent to ratification of the 1980 Convention
on Conventional Weapons (CCW), which constrains
the use of certain weapons, including landmines.
The Administration is also pursuing a comprehensive
set of initiatives to address the global landmine crisis,
such as strengthening the CCW provisions governing
landmine use, placing international controls on
export, production and stockpiles, and developing
new equipment for more effective demining.

* On May 3, 1994, President Clinton signed a
Presidential Decision Directive establishing ‘U.S.
Policy on Reforming Multilateral Peace Operations.’
This policy represented the first comprehensive
framework for U.S. decisionmaking on issues of
peacekeeping and peace enforcement suited to the
realities of the new international era.

¢ In October 1994, President Clinton transmitted the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to
the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification.
This was the culmination of years of negotiations to
ensure an equitable balance between the rights of
coastal states to control activities in adjacent,
offshore areas to protect their economic, security and
environmental interests and the rights of maritime
states to free and unimpeded navigation and over-
flight of the oceans of the world. This included an
acceptable regime to administer the mineral
resources of the deep seabed, thereby protecting
U.S. interests.

* In March 1995, President Clinton ordered a
sweeping reexamination of the U.S. Government's
approach to putting science and technology to the
service of national security and global stability in
light of the changed security environment, increasing
global economic competition and growing budgetary
pressures. The resulting National Security Science
and Technology Strategy is the country’s first
comprehensive Presidential statement of national
security science and technology priorities.

On the economic front, Administration policies have
created nearly 7.5 million American jobs and established
the foundation for the global economy of the 21st Century:

 

 

* The President worked with the Congress on effective
measures to reduce the federal budget deficit and
restore economic growth. These measures help
increase our competitiveness and strengthen our
position in negotiations with other nations. Two
million of the 7.5 million new jobs created in the last
three years are a result of our efforts to expand
market access for American products overseas. These
efforts have also lead to the creation of over 3

million new small businesses and the lowest
combined rates of unemployment and inflation in 25
years. The federal budget deficit has dropped three
years in a row, from $290 billion to $164 billion a
year.

The President secured approval of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which
creates the world’s largest free trade zone and has
already created nearly 310,000 American jobs. The
vote for NAFTA marked a decisive U.S. affirmation
of its international engagement. Through NAFTA’s
environmental and labor side agreements, we are
working actively to protect the rights of workers and
to reduce air and water pollution that crosses
national boundaries. When Mexico came under
short-term financial pressures in December 1994, the
United States took the lead in marshaling interna-
tional support to assist the country in meeting this
challenge. NAFTA helped to protect and increase
U.S. exports to that country — and the jobs they
support — during the financial crisis and the subse-
quent adjustment period. We have also begun nego-
tiations with Chile to join NAFTA.

The Administration stood at the forefront of a multi-
lateral effort to achieve history’s most extensive
market-opening agreements in the GATT Uruguay-
round negotiations on world trade. Working with a
bipartisan coalition in the Congress, the President
secured approval of this path-breaking agreement
and the resulting World Trade Organization, which
will add $150 billion annually to the U.S. economy
once fully phased in and create hundreds of thou-
sands of jobs.

The President convened the first meeting of leaders
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum and took steps to expand our ties with the
economies of the Asia-Pacific region, the fastest

 

growing area in the world. At their second forum,
APEC leaders embraced the goal of free trade within
the region by 2020, and at their third meeting in
Osaka in 1995, they formulated a positive action
plan to facilitate and measure progress toward
achieving that goal. This past year, we successfully
negotiated historic trade agreements with our Asian
trading partners, including China, Japan and Korea,
all of which promote substantial new access for
American products and which will foster new atti-
tudes of openness toward our exports.

The President hosted the Summit of the Americas in
December 1994, a historic gathering where the 34
democratic nations of the hemisphere committed
themselves to completing negotiations by 2005 on a
regional free-trade agreement. In June 1995, the
United States hosted the Denver Trade Ministerial
and Commerce Forum to promote trade liberaliza-
tion and business facilitation throughout the Western
Hemisphere.

At President Clinton’s initiative, the G-7 Leaders put
forth at the Halifax Economic Summit extensive
proposals to prepare our international financial insti-
tutions for the 21st Century, including institutional
reforms to prevent and respond to financial crises, to
promote sustainable development and to support the
Middle East peace process. At the December 1995
U.S.-European Union Summit in Madrid, the
President announced the New Transatlantic Agenda,
including a Transatlantic Marketplace that will
deepen our cooperation on economic issues.

The President developed a Climate Change Action
Plan to help reduce greenhouse emissions at home
and launched the U.S. Initiative on Joint
Implementation to help reduce emissions abroad.
The United States also takes a leading role at the
international level in phasing out ozone-depleting
substances. In June 1993, the United States signed
the Biodiversity Treaty and one year later, the
Desertification Convention.

With strong U.S. leadership, the United Nations
successfully concluded negotiations on a multilateral
agreement designed to reverse the global trend of
declining fish stocks. The agreement complements
the UN Law of the Sea Convention, giving direction

to countries for implementing their obligation under
the Convention to cooperate in conserving and
managing straddling and highly migratory fish stocks.

The Administration has asserted world leadership on
population issues. We played a key role during the
Cairo Conference on Population and Development
in developing a consensus Program of Action,
including increased availability of voluntary family
planning and reproductive health services, sustain-
able economic development, strengthening of family
ties, the empowerment of women including
enhanced educational opportunities and a reduction
in infant and child mortality through immunizations
and other programs.

unmistakable signal of their support for peace. In
1994, U.S. engagement in Northern Ireland
contributed to the establishment of a cease-fire, first
by the IRA and subsequently by loyalist paramili-
taries. U.S. economic and trade initiatives, including
the White House Conference on Trade and
Investment in May 1995, are aimed at promoting
economic revitalization and job creation in Northern
Ireland.

At the Summit of the Americas, the 34 democratic
nations of the hemisphere agreed to a detailed plan
of cooperative action in such diverse fields as health,
education, science and technology, counter-
narcotics, counterterrorism, environmental protec-
tion, information infrastructure and the strengthening

Finally, the President has demonstrated a firm commitment
to expanding the global realm of democracy to advance
the interests of our citizens:

and safeguarding of democratic institutions, in addi-
tion to mutual prosperity and sustainable develop-
ment. The Summit ushered in a new era of hemi-

The United States launched a series of initiatives to
bolster the new democracies of Central and Eastern
Europe, including the White House Trade and
Investment Conference for Central and Eastern
Europe held in Cleveland in January 1995. We
affirmed our concern for their security and market
economic transformation, recognizing that such
assurances would play a key role in promoting
democratic developments.

Working with the international community under the
auspices of the UN, we succeeded in reversing the
coup in Haiti and restoring the democratically
elected president and government. We are now
helping the Haitian people rebuild their country and
consolidate their hard-won democracy through free
and fair elections at all levels — local, parliamentary
and presidential.

The President's visit to Northern Ireland in November
1995, the first ever by an American President, drew
an unprecedented response from the people of both
the Catholic and Protestant communities and sent an

democratic institutions, thwarting international crimi-
nals and terrorists and preserving natural resources
have helped improve the lives of the hemisphere’s
residents.

The United States has increased support for South
Africa as it conducted elections and became a
multiracial democracy. During the state visit of
Nelson Mandela in October 1994, we announced
formation of a bilateral commission to foster new
cooperation between our nations and an assistance
package to support housing, health, education, trade
and investment.

The United States, working with the Organization of
American States, helped reverse an antidemocratic
coup in Guatemala.

In Mozambique and Angola, the United States
played a leading role in galvanizing the international
community to help bring an end to two decades of
civil war and to promote national reconciliation. For
the first time, there is the prospect that all of southern
Africa will enjoy the fruits of peace and prosperity.

At the 1993 UN Conference on Human Rights, the
United States successfully argued for improved inter-

 

 

national mechanisms for the promotion of basic
human rights on a global basis. The President signed
the international convention on the rights of the child
and supports Senate consent to ratification for the
convention prohibiting discrimination against
women. The United States also played a major role
in promoting women’s — and children’s — interna-
tional rights at the 1995 UN Conference on Women
in Beijing.

The national security strategy has reaped significant
accomplishments for the betterment of the American
people. It continues to take advantage of remarkable
opportunities to shape a world conducive to U.S. interests
and consistent with American values — a world of open
societies and open markets. Its tangible results were based
on the belief that if we withdraw U.S. leadership from the
world today, we will have to contend with the conse-
quences of our neglect tomorrow. The progress the
strategy has enabled us to make toward increased security,
prosperity and advancement of democracy was not
inevitable; nor will it proceed easily in an even, uninter-
rupted way — there is a price for our leadership. Because
of this, we know that there must be limits to America’s
involvement in the world — limits imposed by careful
evaluation of our fundamental interests and frank assess-

 

ment of the costs and benefits of possible actions. We
cannot become involved in every problem, but the
choices we make must be always guided by our objectives
of a more secure, prosperous and free America and remain
rooted in the conviction that America cannot walk away
from its global interests or responsibilities, or our citizens’
security and prosperity will surely suffer.

As the distinction between domestic problems and interna-
tional ones is increasingly blurred, we each have a very
direct interest in ensuring the future success of this
strategy: we cannot solve our own problems at home
unless we are also operating in a world that is more
peaceful, more democratic and more prosperous. If we
can help lead the dozens of nations, the billions of
producers and consumers who are trying to adapt to
democracy and free markets, we help to create the condi-
tions for the greatest expansion of prosperity and security
the world has ever witnessed. This is what this strategy
portends by reaffirming America’s leadership in the world.

This report has two major sections. The first part of the
report explains our strategy of engagement and enlarge-
ment. The second part describes briefly how the
Administration continues to apply this strategy to the
world’s major regions.

 

 

Il. Advancing our Interests Through
Engagement and Enlargement

A new international era presents the United States with
many distinct dangers, but also with a generally improved
security environment and a range of opportunities to
improve it further. The preeminent threat that dominated
our engagement during the Cold War has been replaced
by a complex set of challenges. Our nation’s strategy for
defining and addressing those challenges has several core
principles that guide our policies to safeguard American
security, prosperity and fundamental values. First and fore-
most, we must exercise global leadership. We are not the
world’s policeman, but as the world’s premier economic
and military power, and with the strength of our democ-
ratic values, U.S. engagement is indispensable to the
forging of stable political relations and open trade to
advance our interests.

Our leadership must stress preventive diplomacy —
through such means as support for democracy, economic
assistance, overseas military presence, interaction between
U.S. and foreign militaries and involvement in multilateral
negotiations in the Middle East and elsewhere — in order
to help resolve problems, reduce tensions and defuse
conflicts before they become crises. These measures are a
wise investment in our national security because they offer
the prospect of resolving problems with the least human
and material cost.

Our engagement must be selective, focusing on the chal-
lenges that are most important our own interests and
focusing our resources where we can make the most
difference. We must also use the right tools — being
willing to act unilaterally when our direct national interests
are most at stake; in alliance and partnership when our
interests are shared by others; and multilaterally when our

 

interests are more general and the problems are best
addressed by the international community.

In all cases, the nature of our response must depend on
what best serves our own long-term national interests.
Those interests are ultimately defined by our security
requirements. Such requirements start with our physical
defense and economic well-being. They also include envi-
ronmental security as well as the security of our values
achieved through expansion of the community of democ-
ratic nations.

Our national security strategy draws upon a range of polit-
ical, military and economic instruments, and focuses on
the primary objectives that President Clinton has stressed
throughout his Administration:

¢ Enhancing Our Security. Taking account of the reali-
ties of the new international era with its array of new
threats, a military capability appropriately sized and
postured to meet the diverse needs of our strategy,
including the ability, in concert with regional allies,
to win two nearly simultaneous major regional
conflicts. We will continue to pursue a combination
of diplomatic, economic and defense efforts,
including arms control agreements, to reduce the
danger of nuclear, chemical, biological and conven-
tional conflict and to promote stability.

© Promoting Prosperity at Home. A vigorous and inte-
grated economic policy designed to put our own
economic hotse in order, work toward free and
open markets abroad and promote sustainable
development.

11

 

¢ Promoting Democracy. A framework of democratic
enlargement that increases our security by protecting,
consolidating and enlarging the community of free
market democracies. Our efforts focus on strength-
ening democratic processes in key emerging democ-
ratic states including Central and Eastern Europe,
Russia, Ukraine and other new independent states of
the former Soviet Union.

In order to advance these objectives, we must remain
engaged in the world through U.S. leadership, with our
national security strategy based on enlarging the world
community of secure, democratic and free market nations.
Overall, this makes the world a safer and more prosperous
place and in so doing directly advances our interests.
Nations that feel secure due to our engagement overseas
are more likely to support free trade and democratic insti-
tutions, thereby enhancing U.S. security and prosperity;
nations with growing and open economies and strong ties
to the United States are more likely to feel secure and to be
unafraid of freedom, thereby not threatening us or others;
and democratic states with similar values are less likely to
threaten one another's interests, and are more likely to
cooperate in confronting mutual security threats and in
promoting free and open trade and economic develop-
ment.

The three basic objectives of our national security strategy
will also guide the allocation of our limited national secu-
rity resources. Because deficit reduction is also central to
the long-term health and competitiveness of the American
economy, we have made it, along with efficient and envi-
ronmentally sound use of our resources, a major priority.
Under the Clinton economic plan, the federal budget
deficit has been lowered as a percentage of the Gross
Domestic Product from 4.9 percent in Fiscal Year 1992 to
2.4 percent in Fiscal Year 1995 — the lowest since 1979.

Enhancing our Security

The U.S. government is responsible for protecting the lives
and personal safety of Americans, maintaining our political
freedom and independence as a nation and promoting the
well-being and prosperity of our nation. No matter how
powerful we are as a nation, we cannot always secure
these basic goals unilaterally. Whether the problem is
nuclear proliferation, regional instability, the reversal of
reform in the former Soviet empire, international crime and

12

 

terrorism, or unfair trade practices, the threats and chal-
lenges we face frequently demand cooperative, multina-
tional solutions. Therefore, the only responsible U.S.
strategy is one that seeks to ensure U.S. influence over and
participation in collective decisionmaking in a wide and
growing range of circumstances.

An important element of our security preparedness
depends on durable relationships with allies and other
friendly nations. Accordingly, a central thrust of our
strategy of engagement is to sustain and adapt the security
relationships we have with key nations around the world.
These ties constitute an important part of an international
framework that will be essential to ensuring cooperation
across a broad range of issues. Within the realm of security
issues, our cooperation with allies and friendly nations
includes such activities as: conducting combined training
and exercises, coordinating military plans and prepara-
tions, sharing intelligence — particularly in support of
multilateral peacekeeping efforts or initiatives to contain
the inimical behavior of rogue states — jointly developing
new systems to include cooperative research and develop-
ment programs and controlling exports of sensitive tech-
nologies according to common standards.

The new era presents a different set of threats to our secu-
rity. In this new period, enhancing American security
requires, first and foremost, developing and maintaining a
strong defense capability of forces ready to fight. We are
developing integrated approaches for dealing with threats
arising from the development of nuclear and other
weapons of mass destruction by other nations. Our security
also requires a vigorous arms control effort and a strong
intelligence capability. We have implemented a strategy
for multilateral peace operations. We have clarified
rigorous guidelines for when and how to use military force
in this era.

We also face security risks that are not solely military in
nature. An emerging class of transnational environmental
and natural resource issues, and rapid population growth
and refugee flows, are increasingly affecting international
stability and consequently will present new challenges to
U.S. strategy. Other increasingly interconnected, transna-
tional phenomena such as terrorism, narcotics trafficking
and organized crime also have security implications both
for present and long-term American policy: the destructive
forces we face inside our borders often have their origins
overseas in rogue nations that breed and harbor terrorists,

 

 

in countries where drugs are produced and in international
organized crime cartels, which are principally headquar-
tered outside our borders; and free and open societies, in a
world brought closer together by a technology revolution
where information, money and people can move rapidly
and easily, are inherently more challenged by these kinds
of forces.

We cannot protect ourselves against drug-related crime,
track down terrorists, seize international criminals or stop
the flow of illegal arms or weapons-related materials
without both cooperation among the agencies within our
government and the help of countries that are the origin of
these forces and whose peace and freedoms are also jeop-
ardized, That is why the President proposed new legisla-
tion and initiatives for the U.S. government last year, while
also unveiling a new international proposal to work more
closely with foreign governments in order to respond more
effectively in fighting these forces that challenge our secu-
rity from within and without.

Finally, the threat of intrusions to our military and commer-
cial information systems poses a significant risk to national
security and is being addressed.

Maintaining a Strong Defense Capability

U.S. military forces are critical to the success of our
strategy. This nation has unparalleled military capabilities:
the United States is the only nation able to conduct large-
scale and effective military operations far beyond its
borders. This fact, coupled with our unique position as the
security partner of choice in many regions, provides a
foundation for regional stability through mutually benefi-
cial security partnerships. Our willingness and ability to
play a leading role in defending common interests also
help ensure that the United States will remain an influen-
tial voice in international affairs — political, military and
economic — that affect our well-being, so long as we
retain the military wherewithal to underwrite our commit-
ments credibly.

To protect and advance U.S. interests in the face of the
dangers and opportunities outlined earlier, the United
States must deploy robust and flexible military forces that
can accomplish a variety of tasks:

 

¢ Deterring and Defeating Aggression in Major
Regional Conflicts. Our forces must be able to help
offset the military power of regional states with inter-
ests opposed to those of the United States and its
allies. To do this, we must be able to credibly deter
and defeat aggression by projecting and sustaining
U.S. power in more than one region if necessary.

* Providing a Credible Overseas Presence. U.S. forces
must also be forward deployed or stationed in key
overseas regions in peacetime to deter aggression
and advance U.S. strategic interests. Such overseas
presence demonstrates our commitment to allies and
friends, underwrites regional stability, ensures famil-
iarity with overseas operating environments,
promotes combined training among the forces of
friendly countries and provides timely initial
response capabilities.

* Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction. We are
devoting greater efforts to stemming the proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery
means, limiting the spread of weapons-related mate-
rials and technology, and strengthening accounting
and security procedures for global stocks of fissile
materials. At the same time, we must improve our
capabilities to deter, defend against and prevent the
use of such weapons and protect ourselves against
their effects.

* Contributing to Multilateral Peace Operations.
When our interests call for it, the United States must
also be prepared to participate in multilateral efforts
to resolve regional conflicts and bolster new democ-
ratic governments. Thus, our forces must be ready to
participate in peacekeeping, peace enforcement and
other operations in support of these objectives.

* Supporting Counterterrorism Efforts, Fighting Drug
Trafficking and Other National Security Objectives.
A number of other tasks remain that U.S. forces have
typically carried out with both general purpose and
specialized units. These missions include: counterter-
rorism, noncombatant evacuation, counter-narcotics
operations, special forces assistance to nations and
humanitarian and disaster relief operations.

To meet all of these requirements successfully, our forces
must be capable of responding quickly and operating

13

effectively as a joint team. That is, they must be ready to
fight and win. This imperative demands highly qualified
and motivated people; modern, well-maintained equip-
ment; realistic training; strategic mobility; sufficient support
and sustainment capabilities; timely intelligence; and a
healthy investment in science and technology.

Major Regional Contingencies

The focus of our planning for major theater conflict is on
deterring and, if necessary, fighting and defeating aggres-
sion by potentially hostile regional powers, such as North
Korea, Iran or Iraq. Such states are capable of fielding
sizable military forces which can cause serious imbalances
in military power within regions important to the United
States, with allied or friendly states often finding it difficult
to match the power of a potentially aggressive neighbor.
To deter aggression, prevent coercion of allied or friendly
governments and, ultimately, defeat aggression should it
occur, we must prepare our forces to confront this scale of
threat, preferably in concert with our allies and friends, but
unilaterally if necessary. To do this, we must have forces
that can deploy quickly and supplement U.S. forward-
based and forward-deployed forces, along with regional
allies, in halting an invasion and defeating the aggressor,
just as we demonstrated by our rapid response in October
1994 when Iraq threatened aggression against Kuwait.

The forces the Administration fields today are sufficient, in
concert with regional allies, to defeat aggression in two
nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts. Programmed
enhancements will sustain and strengthen that capability to
meet future threats, As a nation with global interests, it is
important that the United States maintain forces with
aggregate capabilities on this scale. Obviously, we seek to
avoid a situation in which an aggressor in one region
might be tempted to take advantage when U.S. forces are
heavily committed elsewhere. More basically, maintaining
a ‘two war’ force helps ensure that the United States will
have sufficient military capabilities to deter or defeat
aggression by a coalition of hostile powers or by a larger,
more capable adversary than we foresee today. The need
to deter or defeat aggression in two theaters was demon-
strated by the real prospect of near simultaneous hostilities
with Iraq and North Korea in the late summer of 1994. The
threat of such near simultaneous hostilities and our rapid
response in reinforcing our presence and deploying addi-
tional forces showed we have a correct and realistic
defense strategy. And because tomorrow’s threats are less

14

 

clear, a strategy for deterring and defeating aggression in
more than one theater ensures we maintain the flexibility
to meet unknown future threats, while our continued
engagement represented by that strategy helps preclude
such threats from developing in the first place.

We will never know with certainty how an enemy might
fight or precisely what demands might be placed on our
own forces in the future. The contributions of allies or
coalition partners will vary from place to place and over
time. Thus, balanced U.S. forces are needed in order to
provide a wide range of complementary capabilities and to
cope with the unpredictable and unexpected. Our forces
must remain ready and modern to meet future, as well as
present, threats or challenges. Integral to these efforts is the
development of new systems and capabilities, incorpo-
rating state-of-the-art technology and new and more effec-
tive combat organizations.

Overseas Presence

The need to deploy U.S. military forces abroad in peace-
time is also an important factor in determining our overall
force structure. We will maintain robust overseas presence
in several forms, such as permanently stationed forces and
pre-positioned equipment, deployments and combined
exercises, port calls and other force visits, as well as mili-
tary-to-military contacts. These activities provide several
benefits. Specifically they:

* Give form and substance to our bilateral and multi-
lateral security commitments.

* Demonstrate our determination to defend U.S. and
allied interests in critical regions, deterring hostile
nations from acting contrary to those interests.

* Provide forward elements for rapid response in crises
as well as the bases, ports and other infrastructure
essential for deployment of U.S.-based forces by air,
sea and land.

* Enhance the effectiveness of coalition operations,
including peace operations, by improving our ability
to operate with other nations.

¢ Allow the United States to use its position of trust to
prevent the development of power vacuums and

 

dangerous arms races, thereby underwriting regional
stability by precluding threats to regional security.

* Facilitate regional integration, since nations that may
not be willing to work together in our absence may
be willing to coalesce around us in a crisis.

* Promote an international security environment of
trust, cooperation, peace and stability, which is
fundamental to the vitality of developing democra-
cies and free-market economies for America’s own
economic well-being and security.

Through training programs, combined exercises, military
contacts, interoperability and shared defense with potential
coalition partners, as well as security assistance programs
that include judicious foreign military sales, we can
strengthen the local self-defense capabilities of our friends
and allies. Through active participation in regional security
dialogues, we can reduce regional tensions, increase trans-
parency in armaments and improve our bilateral and
multilateral cooperation.

By improving the defense capabilities of our friends and
demonstrating our commitment to defend common inter-
ests, these activities enhance deterrence, encourage
responsibility-sharing on the part of friends and allies,
decrease the likelihood that U.S. forces will be necessary if
conflict arises and raise the odds that U.S. forces will find a
relatively favorable situation should a U.S. response be
required. U.S. overseas presence visibly supports our
strategy of engagement, and we must continually assess
the best approaches to achieving its objectives.

Counterterrorism, Fighting Drug Trafficking and
Other Missions

While the missions outlined above will remain the primary
determinants of our general purpose and nuclear force
structure, U.S. military forces and assets will also be called
upon to perform a wide range of other important missions
as well. Some of these can be accomplished by conven-
tional forces fielded primarily for theater operations. Often,
however, these missions call for specialized units and
capabilities.

At the same time, the challenges to the security of our citi-
zens, our borders and our democratic institutions from
destructive forces such as terrorists and drug traffickers is

 

greater today because of access to modern technology.
Cooperation, both within our government and with other
nations, is vital in combating these groups that traffic in
organized violence.

In October 1995, the President announced a new initiative
to work more closely with foreign governments to fight
these forces that threaten our security from without and
within. Along with other provisions, it includes an invita-
tion to join in the negotiation and endorsement of a decla-
ration on citizen security, which would include a no-sanc-
tuary pledge to terrorists and drug traffickers; a counterter-
rorism pact; an antinarcotics offensive; and a pledge to end
the trafficking of illegal arms and of lethal nuclear, biolog-
ical and chemical materials. We will continue to share
intelligence in anticorruption and money-laundering
programs to fight drug trafficking at its source; seek legisla-
tion that would prevent arms traders from fueling regional
conflicts and subverting international embargoes; and
provide increased manpower and funding, strengthened
legislation and additional sanctions on states that sponsor
terrorism to help protect our citizens.

Combating Terrorism

As long as terrorist groups continue to target American citi-
zens and interests, the United States will need to have
specialized units available to defeat such groups. From
time to time, we might also find it necessary to strike terror-
ists at their bases abroad or to attack assets valued by the
governments that support them.

Our policy in countering international terrorists is to make
no concessions to terrorists, continue to pressure state
sponsors of terrorism, fully exploit all available legal mech-
anisms to punish international terrorists and help other
governments improve their capabilities to combat
terrorism.

Countering terrorism effectively requires close, day-to-day
coordination among Executive Branch agencies. Under the
Clinton Administration, the efforts of the Departments of
State, Justice and Defense, the FBI and CIA have been
coordinated, with increased funding and manpower
focused on the problem. Positive results will come from
integration of intelligence, diplomatic and rule-of-law activ-
ities, and through close cooperation with other govern-
ments and international counterterrorist organizations.

15

 

Improving U.S. intelligence capabilities is a significant part
of the U.S. response, as the evolving nature of the threat
presents new challenges to the intelligence community.
Terrorists, whether from well-organized groups or the kind
of more loosely organized group responsible for the World
Trade Center bombing, have the advantage of being able
to take the initiative in the timing and choice of targets.
Terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction repre-
sents a particularly dangerous potential threat that must be
countered.

The United States has made concerted efforts to punish
and deter terrorists. On June 26, 1993, following a deter-
mination that Iraq had plotted an assassination attempt
against former President Bush, President Clinton ordered a
cruise missile attack against the headquarters of Iraq’s intel-
ligence service in order to send a firm response and deter
further threats. Similarly, the United States obtained
convictions against defendants in the bombing of the
World Trade Center. In the last three years, more terrorists
have been arrested and extradited to the United States than
during the totality of the previous three Administrations.
We are still determined to apprehend many others,
including the suspected perpetrators of the Pan Am 103
bombing who are being sheltered in Libya, and those
involved in the deadly attack on U.S. Government
employees at CIA Headquarters in 1994.

A growing number of nations have responded to the
Administration’ s message urging international cooperation
in the fight against terrorism. Our success in hunting down
terrorists is in large measure due to a growth of interna-
tional intelligence sharing and increased international law
enforcement efforts. At the Halifax Summit in 1995, the
heads of state from the G-7 and Russia agreed to work
more closely in combating terrorism. This led to the
December 1995 ministerial in Ottawa, which announced a
P-8 pledge to adopt all current counterterrorism treaties by
the year 2000, to cooperate more closely in detecting
forged documents and strengthening border surveillance,
to share information more fully and effectively and to work
together in preventing the use by terrorists of nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons.

Iran’s support of terrorism is a primary threat to peace in
the Middle East and a major threat to innocent citizens
everywhere. The President is determined to step up U.S.
efforts bringing international pressure to bear on Iran for its
support of terrorism. President Clinton imposed an

16

 

embargo against Iran, depriving it of the benefits of trade
and investment with the United States. The embargo’s
immediate effect was to further disrupt an Iranian
economy already reeling from mismanagement, corruption
and stagnant oil prices. The United States also has sought
the support of our friends and allies to adopt policies to
limit Teheran’s threatening behavior. The G-7 has joined
us in condemning Iran’s support for terrorism, and we
have secured commitments from Russia and other
members of the post-COCOM “Wassenaar Arrangement”
export control regime not to sell weapons to Iran that have
sensitive, dual-use technologies with military end-uses.

U.S. leadership and close coordination with other govern-
ments and international bodies will continue, as also
demonstrated by the UN Security Council sanctions
against Libya for the Pan Am 103 and UTA 772 bombings,
an international convention dealing with detecting and
controlling plastic explosives, and two important countert-
errorism treaties — the Protocol for the Suppression of
Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International
Aviation and the Convention for the Suppression of
Unlawful Attacks Against the Safety of Maritime
Navigation.

Fighting Drug Trafficking

The Administration has undertaken a new approach to the
global scourge of drug abuse and trafficking that will better
integrate domestic and international activities to reduce
both the demand and the supply of drugs. Ultimate
success will depend on concerted efforts and partnerships
by the public, all levels of government and the American
private sector with other governments, private groups and
international bodies.

The U.S. shift in strategy from the past emphasis on transit
interdiction to a more evenly balanced effort with source
countries to build institutions, destroy trafficking organiza-
tions and stop supplies of illicit drugs is showing positive
results. The leaders of the most influential South American
drug mafias, the Medellin and Cali Cartels, have been
apprehended. The President also has invoked the
International Emergency Economic Powers Act to undercut
their financial underpinnings, freezing their assets in the
United States and barring U.S. persons from doing busi-
ness with them. He has announced a major initiative to
combat money laundering throughout the globe, and at his
direction, the government has identified the front compa-

 

 

 

nies and frozen the assets of the Cali Cartel to cut off its
economic lifelines and to stop people from dealing
unknowingly with its companies.

In addition, the United States, in cooperation with key
producing countries, has undertaken initiatives to reinforce
its interdiction activities near the source of production. To
help root out the corruption in which narcotics trafficking
thrives, we are working to support and strengthen democ-
ratic institutions abroad. We are also cooperating with
governments that demonstrate political will to confront the
narcotics threat.

Two comprehensive strategies have been developed, one
to deal with the problem of cocaine and another to address
the growing threat from high-purity heroin entering this
country. We will engage more aggressively with interna-
tional organizations, financial institutions and nongovern-
mental organizations in counternarcotics cooperation.

At home and in the international arena, prevention, treat-
ment and economic alternatives must work hand-in-hand
with law enforcement and interdiction activities. Long-term
efforts will be maintained to help nations develop healthy
economies with fewer market incentives for producing
narcotics. The United States has increased efforts abroad to
foster public awareness and support for governmental
cooperation on a broad range of activities to reduce the
incidence of drug abuse. Public awareness of a demand
problem in producing or trafficking countries can be
converted into public support and increased governmental
law enforcement to reduce trafficking and production.
There has been a significant attitudinal change and aware-
ness in Latin America and the Caribbean, particularly as
producer and transit nations themselves become plagued
with the ill effects of consumption.

Other Missions

The United States government is also responsible for
protecting the lives and safety of Americans abroad. In
order to carry out this responsibility, selected U.S. military
forces are trained and equipped to evacuate Americans
from such situations as the outbreak of civil or international
conflict and natural or man-made disasters. For example,
U.S. Marines evacuated Americans from Monrovia,

Liberia, in August of 1990, and from Mogadishu, Somalia,
in December of that year. In 1991, U.S. forces evacuated
nearly 20,000 Americans from the Philippines over a three-

 

week period following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. In
1994, U.S. Marines, coupled with U.S. airlift, deployed to
Burundi to help ensure the safe evacuation of U.S. citizens
from ethnic fighting in Rwanda.

U.S. forces also provide invaluable training and advice to
friendly governments threatened by subversion, lawless-
Ness or insurgency. At any given time, we have small
teams of military experts deployed in roughly 25 countries
helping host governments cope with such challenges.

U.S. military forces and assets are frequently called upon
to provide assistance to victims of floods, storms, drought
and other humanitarian disasters. Both at home and
abroad, U.S. forces provide emergency food, shelter,
medical care and security to those in need.

Finally, the United States will continue as a world leader
in space through its technical expertise and innovation.
Over the past 30 years, as more and more nations have
ventured into space, the United States has steadfastly
recognized space as an international region. Since all
nations are immediately accessible from space, the main-
tenance of an international legal regime for space, similar
to the concept of freedom of the high seas, is especially
important. Numerous attempts have been made in the past
to impose legal limitations on access to space by countries
that are unable, either technologically or economically, to
join space-faring nations. As the commercial importance
of space is developed, the United States can expect further
pressure from nonparticipants to redefine the status of
space, similar to what has been attempted with exclusive
economic zones constraining the high seas.

Retaining the current international character of space will
remain critical to achieving U.S. national security goals.
Our main objectives in this area include:

* Continued freedom of access to and use of space;

¢ Maintaining the U.S. position as the major
economic, political, military and technological
power in space;

* Deterring threats to U.S. interests in space and

defeating aggressive or hostile acts against U.S. space
assets if deterrence fails;

17

* Preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruc-
tion to space;

* Enhancing global partnerships with other space-
faring nations across the spectrum of economic,
political and security issues.

Deciding When and How to Employ
U.S. Forces

Our strategy calls for the preparation and deployment of
American military forces in the United States and abroad to
support U.S. diplomacy in responding to key dangers —
those posed by weapons of mass destruction, regional
aggression and threats to the stability of states.

Although there may be many demands for U.S. involve-
ment, the need to husband limited resources requires that
we must carefully select the means and level of our partici-
pation in particular military operations. And while it is
unwise to specify in advance all the limitations we will
place on our use of force, we must be as clear as possible
about when and how we will use it.

There are three basic categories of national interests that
can merit the use of our armed forces. The first involves
America’s vital interests, that is, interests that are of broad,
overriding importance to the survival, security and vitality
of our national entity — the defense of U.S. territory, citi-
zens, allies and our economic well-being. We will do
whatever it takes to defend these interests, including —
when necessary — the unilateral and decisive use of mili-
tary power. This was demonstrated clearly in the Persian
Gulf through Desert Storm and, more recently, Vigilant
Warrior, when Iraq threatened aggression against Kuwait in
October 1994.

The second category includes cases in which important,
but not vital, U.S. interests are threatened. That is, the
interests at stake do not affect our national survival, but
they do affect importantly our national well-being and the
character of the world in which we live. In such cases,
military forces should only be used if they advance U.S.
interests, they are likely to be able to accomplish their
objectives, the costs and risks of their employment are
commensurate with the interests at stake and other means
have been tried and have failed to achieve our objectives.
Such uses of force should also be selective and limited,

18

 

reflecting the relative saliency of the interests we have at
stake. Haiti and Bosnia are the most recent examples in
this category.

The third category involves primarily humanitarian inter-
ests. Here, our decisions focus on the resources we can
bring to bear by using unique capabilities of our military
rather than on the combat power of military force.
Generally, the military is not the best tool to address
humanitarian concerns. But under certain conditions, the
use of our armed forces may be appropriate: when a
humanitarian catastrophe dwarfs the ability of civilian
relief agencies to respond; when the need for relief is
urgent and only the military has the ability to jump-start
the longer-term response to the disaster; when the
response requires resources unique to the military; and
when the risk to American troops is minimal. The relief
operation in Rwanda is a good case in point. U.S. military
forces performed unique and essential roles, stabilized the
situation and then got out, turning the operation over to
the international relief community.

The decision on whether and when to use force is there-
fore dictated first and foremost by our national interests. In
those specific areas where our vital or survival interests are
at stake, our use of force will be decisive and, if necessary,
unilateral. In other situations posing a less immediate
threat, our military engagement must be targeted selec-
tively on those areas that most affect our national interests
— for instance, areas where we have a sizable economic
stake or commitments to allies and areas where there is a
potential to generate substantial refugee flows into our
nation or our allies’.

Second, in all cases, the costs and risks of U.S. military
involvement must be judged to be commensurate with the
stakes involved. We will be more inclined to act where
there is reason to believe that our action will bring lasting
improvement. On the other hand, our involvement will be
more circumscribed when other regional or multilateral
actors are better positioned to act than we are. Even in
these cases, however, the United States will be actively
engaged at the diplomatic level. But in every case, we will
consider several critical questions before committing mili-
tary force: Have we considered nonmilitary means that
offer a reasonable chance of success? Is there a clearly
defined, achievable mission? What is the environment of
risk we are entering? What is needed to achieve our goals?
What are the potential costs — both human and financial

 

 

 

— of the engagement? Do we have a reasonable likeli-
hood of support from the American people and their
elected representatives? Do we have timelines and mile-
stones that will reveal the extent of success or failure, and
in either case, do we have an exit strategy?

The decision on how we use force has a similar set of
derived guidelines:

First, when we send American troops abroad, we will send
them with a clear mission and, for those operations that
are likely to involve combat, the means to achieve their
objectives decisively, having answered the questions:
What types of U.S. military capabilities should be brought
to bear, and is the use of military force carefully matched
to our political objectives?

Second, as much as possible, we will seek the help of our
allies and friends or of relevant international institutions. If
our most important national interests are at stake, we are
prepared to act alone. But especially on those matters
touching directly the interests of our allies, there should be
a proportionate commitment from them. Working together
increases the effectiveness of each nation’s actions, and
sharing the responsibilities lessens everyone's load.

These, then, are the calculations of interest and cost that
have influenced our past uses of military power and will
guide us in the future. Every time this Administration has
used force, it has balanced interests against costs. And in
each case, the use of our military has put power behind

our diplomacy, allowing us to make progress we would

not otherwise have achieved.

One final consideration regards the central role the
American people rightfully play in how the United States
wields its power abroad: the United States cannot long
sustain a fight without the support of the public, and close
consultations with Congress are important to this effort.
This is true for humanitarian and other nontraditional inter-
ventions, as well as war. Modern media communications
confront every American with images that both stir the
impulse to intervene and raise the question of an opera-
tion’s costs and risks. When it is judged in America’s
interest to intervene, we must use force with an unwa-
vering commitment to our objective. While we must
continue to reassess any operation’s costs and benefits as it
unfolds and the full range of our options, reflexive calls for
early withdrawal of our forces as soon as casualties arise

 

endangers our objectives as well as our troops. Doing so
invites any rogue actor to attack our troops to try to force
our departure from areas where our interests lie.

Combating the Spread and Use of
Weapons of Mass Destruction and
Missiles

Weapons of mass destruction — nuclear, biological and
chemical — along with their associated delivery systems,
pose a major threat to our security and that of our allies
and other friendly nations. Thus, a key part of our strategy
is to seek to stem the proliferation of such weapons and to
develop an effective capability to deal with these threats.
We also need to maintain robust strategic nuclear forces
and to implement existing strategic arms agreements.

Nonproliferation and Counterproliferation

A critical priority for the United States is to stem the prolif-
eration of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and
their missile delivery systems. Countries’ weapons
programs, and their levels of cooperation with our nonpro-
liferation efforts, will be among our most important criteria
in judging the nature of our bilateral relations.

Through programs such as the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative
Threat Reduction effort and other denuclearization initia-
tives, important progress has been made to build a more
secure international environment by combating the threat
posed by the possible theft or diversion of nuclear
warheads or their components. One striking example was
the successful transfer in 1994 of nearly six hundred kilo-
grams of vulnerable nuclear material from Kazakstan to
safe storage in the United States. Kazakstan was concerned
about the security of the material and requested U.S. assis-
tance in removing it to safe storage. The Departments of
Defense and Energy undertook a joint mission to retrieve
the uranium. At the direction of the President, the two
Departments have intensified their cooperative programs
with Russia and other new independent states to enhance
the security of nuclear material. These programs encom-
pass both efforts to improve overall systems for nuclear
material protection, control and accounting and targeted
efforts to address specific proliferation risks. Under an
agreement we secured with Russia, it is converting tons of
highly enriched uranium from dismantled weapons into

19

 

commercial reactor fuel and has begun delivering that fuel
to the United States. With the United States and Russia,
Ukraine is implementing the Trilateral Statement, which
provides for the transfer of all nuclear warheads from
Ukraine to Russia for dismantlement in return for fair
compensation. Three-quarters of the nuclear weapons
located in Ukraine at the beginning of 1994 have now
been transferred to Russia for dismantlement. All the
nuclear warheads in Kazakstan have been removed, and
most are out of Belarus.

A key objective of our nonproliferation strategy was real-
ized in May 1995 when a consensus of the parties to the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) extended the
Treaty indefinitely and without conditions. That result
ensured that all Americans today, as well as all succeeding
generations, can count on the continuation of the Treaty
that serves as the bedrock of all global efforts to halt the
spread of nuclear weapons.

Achieving a zero-yield Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as
soon as possible, achieving a cut-off of fissile material
production for nuclear weapons purposes and strength-
ening the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are important goals. They
complement our comprehensive efforts to discourage the
accumulation of fissile materials, to seek to strengthen
controls and constraints on those materials, and over time,
to reduce worldwide stocks.

To combat missile proliferation, the United States seeks
prudently to broaden membership of the Missile
Technology Control Regime (MTCR). The Administration
supports the earliest possible ratification and entry into
force of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) as well
as new measures to deter violations of and enhance
compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention
(BWC). We also support improved export controls for
nonproliferation purposes both domestically and multilat-
erally.

The proliferation problem is global, but we must tailor our
approaches to specific regional contexts. We have
concluded an Agreed Framework to bring North Korea into
full compliance with its nonproliferation obligations,
including the NPT and IAEA safeguards. The agreement
also requires North Korea to freeze and eventually
dismantle its indigenous nuclear program under IAEA
monitoring. We will continue efforts to prevent Iran from

20

 

advancing its weapons of mass destruction objectives and
to thwart Iraq from reconstituting its previous programs.
The United States seeks to cap, reduce and, ultimately,
eliminate the nuclear and missile capabilities of India and
Pakistan. In the Middle East and elsewhere, we encourage
regional arms control agreements that address the legiti-
mate security concerns of all parties. These tasks are being
pursued with other states that share our concern for the
enormous challenge of stemming the proliferation of such
weapons.

The United States has signed bilateral agreements with
Russia, Ukraine and South Africa, which commit these
countries to adhere to the guidelines of the MTCR. We
also secured China’s commitment to observe the MTCR
guidelines and its agreement not to transfer MTCR-
controlled, ground-to-ground missiles. Russia has agreed
not to transfer space-launch vehicle technology with
potential military applications to India. South Africa has
agreed to dismantle its Category | (500 kilogram payload,
300 kilometer range) missile systems and has joined the
NPT and accepted full-scope safeguards. Hungary, the
Czech Republic, the Slovakia Republic, Poland and
Romania have joined the Australia Group (which controls
the transfer of items that could be used to make chemical
or biological weapons). Hungary, Argentina, Russia, Brazil
and South Africa have joined the MTCR. Argentina, Brazil
and Chile have brought the Treaty of Tlatelolco into force.
There has been major progress on the dismantlement and
removal of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)
located in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakstan. Our
Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program has made a
significant contribution to this effort.

Thus, the United States seeks to prevent additional coun-
tries from acquiring chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons and the means to deliver them, and will use the
full range of its intelligence capabilities to detect such
activities. However, should such efforts fail, U.S. forces
must be prepared to deter, prevent and defend against
their use. As agreed at the January 1994 NATO Summit,
we are working with our Allies to develop a policy frame-
work to consider how to reinforce ongoing prevention
efforts and to reduce the proliferation threat and protect
against it.

The United States will retain the capacity to retaliate
against those who might contemplate the use of weapons
of mass destruction so that the costs of such use will be

 

 

 

seen as outweighing the gains. However, to minimize the
impact of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction on
our interests, we will need the capability not only to deter
their use against either ourselves or our allies and friends
but also, where necessary and feasible, to prevent it.

This will require improved defensive and offensive capabil-
ities. To minimize the vulnerability of our forces abroad to
weapons of mass destruction, we are placing a high
priority on improving our ability to locate, identify and
disable arsenals of weapons of mass destruction, produc-
tion and storage facilities for such weapons and their
delivery systems. We also have vigorous and highly effec-
tive theater missile defense development programs
designed to protect against conventional weapons and
weapons of mass destruction. Although the intelligence
community does not believe that an intercontinental-range
missile threat to our homeland is likely to emerge from
rogue states in the foreseeable future, we are developing a
national missile defense deployable readiness program so
we can respond quickly (within 2-3 years) should a
sooner-than-expected threat materialize.

Nuclear Forces

In September 1994, the President approved the recommen-
dations of the Pentagon’s Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). A
key conclusion of this review is that the United States will
retain a triad of strategic nuclear forces sufficient to deter
any future hostile foreign leadership with access to
strategic nuclear forces from acting against our vital inter-
ests and to convince it that seeking a nuclear advantage
would be futile. Therefore, we will continue to maintain
nuclear forces of sufficient size and capability to hold at
risk a broad range of assets valued by such political and
military leaders. The President approved the NPR’s recom-
mended strategic nuclear force posture as the U.S. START
Il force. The forces are: 500 Minuteman ICBMs, 14 Trident
submarines all with D-5 missiles, 20 B-2 and 66 B-52
strategic bombers, and a non-nuclear role for the B-1s. This
force posture allows us the flexibility to reconstitute or
reduce further, as conditions warrant. The NPR also reaf-
firmed the current posture and deployment of nonstrategic
nuclear forces, and the United States has eliminated carrier
and surface ship nuclear weapons capability.

 

Arms Control

Arms control is an integral part of our national security
strategy. Arms control can help reduce incentives to initiate
attack; enhance predictability regarding the size and struc-
ture of forces, thus reducing fear of aggressive intent;
reduce the size of national defense industry establishments
and thus permit the growth of more vital, nonmilitary
industries; ensure confidence in compliance through effec-
tive monitoring and verification; and, ultimately, contribute
to a more stable and calculable balance of power.

In the area of strategic arms control, prescribed reductions

""in strategic offensive arms and the steady shift toward less

destabilizing systems remain indispensable. Ukraine’s
December 1994 accession to the Nuclear Non-prolifera-
tion Treaty — joining Belarus and Kazakstan’s decision to
be non-nuclear weapon states — was followed immedi-
ately by the exchange of instruments of ratification and
brought the START I treaty into force at the December
1994 CSCE summit, paving the way for the Senate’s advice
and consent for ratification of the 1993 START II Treaty on
January 26, 1996. Under START II, the United States and
Russia will each be left with between 3,000 and 3,500
deployed strategic nuclear warheads, which is a two-thirds
reduction from the Cold War peak. Presidents Clinton and
Yeltsin have agreed that once START II is ratified by both
countries, both nations will immediately begin to deacti-
vate or otherwise remove from combat status, those
systems whose elimination will be required by that treaty,
rather than waiting for the treaty to run its course through
the year 2003. START II ratification will also open the door
to the next round of strategic arms control, in which we
will consider what further reductions in, or limitations on,
remaining U.S. and Russian nuclear forces should be
carried out. We will also explore strategic confidence-
building measures and mutual understandings that reduce
the risk of accidental war.

The full and faithful implementation of other existing arms
control agreements, including the Anti-Ballistic Missile
(ABM) Treaty, Strategic Arms Reduction Talks | (START 1),
Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), Intermediate-
range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, Conventional Forces in
Europe (CFE) Treaty, several nuclear testing agreements, the
1994 Vienna Document on Confidence and Security-
Building Measures (CSBMs), Open Skies, the
Environmental Modification Convention (EnMod), Incidents
at Sea and many others will remain an important element

21

of national security policy. The ongoing negotiation initi-
ated by the United States to clarify the ABM Treaty by
establishing an agreed demarcation between strategic and
theater ballistic missiles, and updating the Treaty to reflect
the break-up of the Soviet Union as well as the
Administration’s efforts to resolve the CFE flank issue on the
basis of a map realignment, reflects the Administration’s
commitment to maintaining the integrity and effectiveness
of crucial arms control agreements.

Future arms control efforts may become more regional and
multilateral. Regional arrangements can add predictability
and openness to security relations, advance the rule of
international law and promote cooperation among partici-
pants. They help maintain deterrence and a stable military
balance at regional levels. The United States is prepared to
promote, help negotiate, monitor and participate in
regional arms control undertakings compatible with
American national security interests. We will generally
support such undertakings but will not seek to impose
regional arms control accords against the wishes of affected
states. In this regard, the United States, United Kingdom
and France announced they would sign the protocols to the
South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone in the first half of 1996.

As arms control, whether regional or global, becomes
increasingly multilateral, the Conference on Disarmament
(CD) in Geneva will play an even more important role. The
United States will support measures to increase the effec-
tiveness and relevance of the CD. Arms control agreements
can head off potential arms races in certain weapons cate-
gories or in some environments. We will continue to seek
greater transparency, responsibility and, where appropriate,
restraint in the transfer of conventional weapons and global
military spending. The UN register of conventional arms
transfers is a start in promoting greater transparency of
weapons transfers and buildups, but more needs to be
done.

In February 1995, the President approved a comprehensive
policy on transfers of conventional arms that balances legit-
imate arms sales to support the national security of U.S.
allies and friends and the need for multilateral restraint in
transferring arms that would undermine stability. The
United States has also led international efforts to create the
multilateral “Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls
for Conventional Arms and Dual-use Goods and
Technology” — the successor to the Coordinating
Committee for East-West Trade (COCOM) — to provide a

22

 

regime for transparency and restraint on dangerous trans-
fers of conventional arms and dual-use technologies.
Measures to reduce over-sized defense industrial establish-
ments, especially those parts involved with weapons of
mass destruction, will also contribute to stability in the
post-Cold War world. The Administration has pursued
defense conversion agreements with the former Soviet
Union states, and defense conversion is also on the
agenda with China. The United States has also proposed a
regime to reduce the number and availability of the
world’s long-lived antipersonnel mines whose indiscrimi-
nate and irresponsible use has reached crisis proportions.
In addition, the Administration is leading the international
effort to strengthen the laws governing landmine use in the
1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons. The
Administration obtained Senate consent to ratification of
this Convention in March 1995.

Peace Operations

In addition to preparing for major regional contingencies
and overseas presence, we must prepare our forces for
peace operations to support democracy or conflict resolu-
tion. The United States, along with others in the interna-
tional community, will seek to prevent and contain local-
ized conflicts before they require a military response. U.S.
support capabilities such as airlift, intelligence and global
communications have often contributed to the success of
multilateral peace operations, and they will continue to do
so. U.S. combat units are less likely to be used for most
peace operations, but in some cases their use will be
necessary or desirable and justified by U.S. national inter-
ests as guided by the Presidential Decision Directive, ‘U.S.
Policy on Reforming Multilateral Peace Operations,’ and
outlined below.

Multilateral peace operations are an important component
of our strategy. From traditional peacekeeping to peace
enforcement, multilateral peace operations are sometimes
the best way to prevent, contain or resolve conflicts that
could otherwise be far more costly and deadly.

Peace operations often have served, and continue to serve,
important U.S. national interests. In some cases, they have
helped preserve peace between nations, as in Cyprus and
the Golan Heights. In others, peacekeepers have provided
breathing room for fledgling democracies, as in Cambodia,
EI Salvador and Namibia. And in Latin America, the
United States, along with fellow Guarantors of the 1942

 

Rio Protocol Argentina, Brazil and Chile, has contributed
to a border monitoring effort to stop fighting between Peru
and Ecuador and help achieve a lasting resolution of their
border dispute.

At the same time, however, we must recognize that some
types of peace operations make demands on the UN that
exceed the organization’s capabilities. The United States is
working with the UN headquarters and other member
states to ensure that the UN embarks only on peace opera-
tions that make political and military sense and that the
UN is able to manage effectively those peace operations it
does undertake. We support the creation of a professional
UN peace operations headquarters with a planning staff,
access to timely intelligence, a logistics unit that can be
rapidly deployed and a modern operations center with
global communications. The United States has reduced
our peacekeeping payments to 25 percent while working
to ensure that other nations pay their fair share. We are
also working to ensure that peacekeeping operations by
appropriate regional organizations such as NATO and the
OSCE can be carried out effectively.

In order to maximize the benefits of UN peace operations,
the United States must make highly disciplined choices
about when and under what circumstances to support or
participate in them. The need to exercise such discipline is
at the heart of President Clinton’s policy on Reforming
Multilateral Peace Operations. The President’s policy
review on peace operations — the most thorough ever
undertaken by an Administration — requires the United
States to undertake a rigorous analysis of requirements and
capabilities before voting to support or participate in
peace operations. The United States has not hesitated to
use its position on the Security Council to ensure that the
UN authorizes only those peace operations that meet
these standards.

Most UN peacekeeping operations do not involve U.S.
forces. On those occasions when we consider contributing
U.S. forces to a UN peace operation, we will employ
rigorous criteria, including the same principles that would
guide any decision to employ U.S. forces. In addition, we
will ensure that the risks to U.S. personnel and the
command and control arrangements governing the partici-
pation of American and foreign forces are acceptable to
the United States.

 

The question of command and control is particularly crit-
ical. There may be times when it is in our interest to place

 

U.S. troops under the temporary operational control of a
competent UN or allied commander. The United States
has done so many times in the past — from the siege of
Yorktown in the Revolutionary War to the battles of Desert
Storm. However, under no circumstances will the
President ever relinquish his command authority over U.S.
forces.

Improving the ways the United States and the UN decide
upon and conduct peace operations will not make the
decision to engage any easier. The lesson we must take
away from our first ventures in peace operations is not that
we should forswear such operations but that we should
employ this tool selectively and more effectively. In short,
the United States views peace operations as a means to
support our national security strategy, not as a strategy
unto itself.

The President is firmly committed to securing the active
support of the Congress for U.S. participation in peace
operations. The Administration has set forth a detailed
blueprint to guide consultations with Congress. With
respect to particular operations, the Administration will
undertake consultations on questions such as the nature of
expected U.S. military participation, the mission parame-
ters of the operation, the expected duration and budgetary
implications. In addition to such operation-specific consul-
tations, the Administration has also conducted regular
monthly briefings for congressional staff and will deliver an
Annual Comprehensive Report to Congress on Peace
Operations. Congress is critical to the institutional devel-
opment of a successful U.S. policy on peace operations,
including the resolution of funding issues that have an
impact on military readiness.

Two other points deserve emphasis. First, the primary
mission of our Armed Forces is not peace operations; it is
to deter and, if necessary, to fight and win conflicts in
which our most important interests are threatened. Second,
while the international community can create conditions
for peace, the responsibility for peace ultimately rests with
the people of the country in question.

Strong Intelligence Capabilities

USS. intelligence capabilities are critical instruments of our
national power and integral to implementing our national
security strategy. Strong intelligence capabilities are
needed to protect our nation by providing warning of

23

 

threats to U.S. national security, by providing support to
the policy and military communities to prevail over these
threats and by identifying opportunities for advancing our
national interests through support to diplomacy.
Decisionmakers, military commanders and policy analysts
at all levels rely on the intelligence community to collect
information unavailable from other sources and to provide
strategic and tactical analysis to help surmount challenges
to our national interests and security.

Because of the change in the security environment since
the end of the Cold War, intelligence must address a
wider range of threats and policy needs. In this demanding
environment, the intelligence community must maintain
its global reach, refine and further focus its collection
efforts and work even more closely with the policy depart-
ments. Moreover, its analytic effort must provide a
coherent framework to help senior U.S. officials manage a
complex range of military, political and economic issues.
Intelligence emphasis must be placed on preserving and
enhancing those collection and analytic capabilities that
provide unique information against those states and
groups that pose the most serious threats to U.S. security.

To build greater focus, direction and responsiveness into
these intelligence activities, the President last year signed a
Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) on intelligence
priorities. This Directive established for the first time a
series of categories of intelligence needs. This PDD is a
flexible document designed to accommodate shifting
priorities within the categories. Current Presidential priori-
ties include:

* Warning and management of threats that pose a
direct or immediate threat to U.S. interests.

« “Rogue states” whose policies are consistently
hostile to the United States.

* Countries that possess strategic nuclear forces that
can pose a threat to the United States and its allies.

¢ Command and control of nuclear weapons and
control of nuclear fissile materials.

¢ Transnational threats such as proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, international narcotics
trafficking, international terrorism and international
organized crime.

24

 

* Ongoing or potential major regional conflicts where
the United States has national security interests.

Intensified counterintelligence against hostile foreign
intelligence services.

U.S. intelligence must not only monitor traditional threats
but also assist the policy community to forestall new and
emerging threats, especially those of a transnational nature.
In carrying out these responsibilities, the intelligence
community must:

¢ Support U.S. military operations worldwide.
Whenever U.S. forces are deployed, the highest
priority is to ensure that our military commanders
receive the timely information required to execute
successfully their mission while minimizing the loss
of American lives.

¢ Support diplomatic efforts in pursuit of U.S. foreign
policy objectives by providing policymakers and
diplomats timely intelligence on political develop-
ments in key areas such as the Middle East, the
Balkans and North Korea.

* Provide worldwide capabilities to detect, identify and
deter efforts of foreign nations to develop weapons of
mass destruction and ancillary delivery systerns.

¢ Gather information on terrorist activities aimed at
U.S. persons or interests and help thwart such activi-
ties whether conducted by well-organized groups or
loose associations of disaffected individuals intent on
striking at the United States.

* Provide worldwide capabilities to gather timely intel-
ligence on current and emerging information tech-
nologies or infrastructure that may potentially
threaten U.S. interests at home or abroad.

* Contribute where appropriate to policy efforts aimed
at bolstering our economic prosperity.

¢ Provide the timely information necessary to monitor
treaties, promote democracy and free markets, forge
alliances and track emerging threats.

The collection and analysis of economic intelligence will
play an increasingly important role in helping policy-

 

 

makers understand economic trends. Economic intelli-
gence can help by identifying threats to private U.S.
economic enterprises from foreign intelligence services as
well as unfair trading practices. Intelligence must also iden-
tify emerging threats that could affect the international
economy and the stability of some nation states, such as
the upsurge in international organized crime and illegal
trafficking in narcotics.

The development and implementation of U.S. policies to
promote democracy abroad relies on sound intelligence
support. In order to forecast adequately dangers to democ-
racy abroad, the intelligence community and policy
departments must track political, economic, social and
military developments in those parts of the world where
U.S. interests are most heavily engaged and where collec-
tion of information from open sources is inadequate. This
often leads to early warning of potential crises and facili-
tates preventive diplomacy.

Improving the management of intelligence resources and
focusing on the principal concerns of policymakers and
military commanders enhances the value of intelligence
and contributes to our national well-being. The establish-
ment, for example, of the National Imagery and Mapping
Agency will provide a more integrated imagery capability
that will be especially important in providing warning of
threats to U.S. and allied interests and in supporting crisis
management and military operations. Intelligence
producers must develop closer relationships with the users
of intelligence to make products more responsive to
current consumer needs. This includes identifying
emerging threats to modern information systems and
supporting the development of protection strategies. The
continuous availability of intelligence, especially during
crises, is of crucial importance. Also underlying all intelli-
gence activities must be an increased awareness of, and
enhanced capabilities in, counterintelligence. Finally, to
enhance the study and support of worldwide environ-
mental, humanitarian and disaster relief activities, technical
intelligence assets — especially imagery — must be
directed to a greater degree toward collection of data on
these subjects.

Fighting International Organized Crime

International organized crime jeopardizes the global trend
toward peace and freedom, undermines fragile new
democracies, saps the strength from developing countries

 

and threatens our efforts to build a safer, more prosperous
world. The rise of organized crime in the new independent
states of the former Soviet Union and Central Europe
weakens new democracies and poses a direct threat to
U.S. interests, particularly in light of the potential for the
theft and smuggling by organized criminals of nuclear
materials left within some of these nations.

The Administration has launched a major initiative to
combat international organized crime. Criminal enterprises
are presently moving vast sums of illegal gains through the
international financial system with impunity. In addition to
invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers
Act to undercut the financial underpinnings of criminal
enterprises, the President has ordered an action plan to
combat money laundering throughout the globe by
directing the government to identify and put on notice
nations that tolerate money laundering. We intend to work
with these nations to bring their banks and financial
systems into conformity with the international standards
against moneylaundering — or we will consider sanctions.
The Justice Department is also drafting legislation, which
will be submitted to Congress, to provide U.S. agencies
with the tools they need to respond to organized criminal
activity.

Because the threat of organized crime comes from abroad
as well as at home, we will work with other nations to
keep our citizens safe. The President’s invitation at the
United Nations to all countries to join the United States in
fighting international organized crime by measures of their
own and by negotiating and endorsing an international
declaration on citizens’ safety — a declaration which
would include a “no-sanctuary for organized criminals”
pledge — is an effort to enhance our international cooper-
ative efforts to protect our people.

International crime organizations target nations whose law
enforcement agencies lack the experience and capacity to
stop them. To help police in the new democracies of
Central Europe, Hungary and the United States established
an international law enforcement academy in Budapest.
The President also proposed last year at the United Nations
an effective police partnership that would establish a
network of such centers around the world to share the
latest crime-fighting techniques and technology.

The President's initiative also targeted the criminal or
quasi-legal enterprises that have begun to develop an enor-

25

 

mous gray-market trade in illegal weapons. By forging
documents or diverting deliveries of armaments, these
networks have been able to move weapons to areas of
conflict or instability. The graymarket continues to fuel
insurgencies and subvert international arms embargoes.
These networks serve criminals and terrorists alike, and
parasitically feed off and ultimately threaten, the open
markets and open societies that we have worked so hard to
advance.

National Security Emergency
Preparedness

We will do all we can to prevent destructive forces such as
terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
threats to our information systems and catastrophes from
within such as natural disasters, from endangering our citi-
zens, But we must also be prepared to respond effectively
if an emergency does occur in order to ensure the surviv-
ability of our institutions and national infrastructure, protect
lives and property and preserve our way of life. National
security emergency preparedness is imperative, and we
must continue to work aggressively to ensure appropriate
threat mitigation and response capabilities, including the
ability to restore to normalcy elements of our society
affected by national security emergencies or disasters
resulting in widespread disruption, destruction, injury or
death. To this end, comprehensive, all-hazard emergency
preparedness planning by all Federal departments and
agencies continues to be a crucial national security
requirement.

The Environment and Sustainable
Development

The more clearly we understand the complex interrelation-
ships between the different parts of our world’s environ-
ment, the better we can understand the regional and even
global consequences of local changes to the environment.
Increasing competition for the dwindling reserves of
uncontaminated air, arable land, fisheries and other food
sources and water, once considered ‘free’ goods, is already
a very real risk to regional stability around the world. The
range of environmental risks serious enough to jeopardize
international stability extends to massive population flight
from man-made or natural catastrophes, such as Chernoby]
or the East African drought, and to large-scale ecosystem
damage caused by industrial pollution, deforestation, loss

26

 

of biodiversity, ozone depletion, desertification, ocean
pollution and, ultimately, climate change. Strategies
dealing with environmental issues of this magnitude will
require partnerships between governments and nongovern-
mental organizations, cooperation between nations and
regions, sustained scientific research and a commitment to
a strategically focused, long-term policy for emerging envi-
ronmental risks.

The decisions we make today regarding military force
structures typically influence our ability to respond to
threats 20 to 30 years in the future. Similarly, our current
decisions regarding the environment and natural resources
will affect the magnitude of their security risks over at least
a comparable period of time, if not longer. The measure of
our difficulties in the future will be settled by the steps we
take in the present.

As a priority initiative, the U.S. successfully led efforts at
the Cairo Conference to develop a consensus Program of
Action to address the continuous climb in global popula-
tion, including increased availability of family planning
and reproductive health services, sustainable economic
development, the empowerment of women to include
enhanced educational opportunities and a reduction in
infant and child mortality. Rapid population growth in the
developing world and unsustainable consumption patterns
in industrialized nations are the root of both present and
potentially even greater forms of environmental degrada-
tion and resource depletion. A conservative estimate of the
globe’s population projects 8.5 billion people on the
planet by the year 2025. Even when making the most
generous allowances for advances in science and tech-
nology, one cannot help but conclude that population
growth and environmental pressures will feed into
immense social unrest and make the world substantially
more vulnerable to serious international frictions.

Promoting Prosperity at Home

A central goal of our national security strategy is to
promote America’s prosperity through efforts both at home
and abroad. Our economic and security interests are
increasingly inseparable. Our prosperity at home depends
on engaging actively abroad. The strength of our diplo-
macy, our ability to maintain an unrivaled military, the
attractiveness of our values abroad — all these depend in
part on the strength of our economy.

 

 

Enhancing American Competitiveness

Our primary economic goal is to strengthen the American
economy. The first step toward that goal was reducing the
federal deficit and the burden it imposes on the economy
and future generations. The economic program passed in
1993 has restored investor confidence in the United States
and strengthened our position in international economic
negotiations. Under the Clinton economic plan, the
federal budget deficit as a percentage of the Gross
Domestic Product was lowered from 4.9 percent in Fiscal
Year 1992 to 2.4 percent in Fiscal Year 1995 — the lowest
since 1979. And Fiscal Year 1995 was the first time that
the deficit has been reduced three years in a row since the
Truman Administration. We are building on this deficit
reduction effort with other steps to improve American
competitiveness: investing in science and technology;
assisting integration of the commercial and military indus-
trial sectors; improving information networks and other
vital infrastructure; and improving education and training
programs for America’s workforce. We are structuring our
defense R&D effort to place greater emphasis on dual-use
technologies that allow the military to capitalize on
commercial-sector innovation for lower cost, higher
quality and increased performance. We are also reforming
the defense acquisition system so that we can develop and
procure weapons and materiel more efficiently.

Strengthening Macroeconomic
Coordination

As national economies become more integrated interna-
tionally, the United States cannot thrive in isolation from
developments abroad. International economic expansion
is benefiting from G-7 macroeconomic policy coordina-
tion. Our work to strengthen an effective, cooperative G-7
dialogue has led to better economic growth in the G-7
countries. In the United States, economic trends point to
continued economic strength and sustained expansion.
Conditions for growth among our G-7 partners appear to
be in place for most countries, and inflation is well under
control.

Enhancing Access to Foreign Markets

The success of American business and our ability to create
quality jobs for our workers is more than ever dependent

 

upon success in exporting to international markets. The
ability to compete internationally also assures that our
companies will continue to innovate and increase produc-
tivity, which in turn will lead to improvements in our own
living standards. But to compete abroad, our firms need
access to foreign markets, just as foreign industries have
access to our open market. We vigorously pursue
measures to increase access for our goods and services —
through bilateral, regional and multilateral arrangements.

Export Strategy and Advocacy Program

In 1993, the Administration published a report creating
America’s first national export strategy and making 65
specific recommendations for reforming the way govern-
ment works with the private sector to expand exports.
Among the recommendations were significant improve-
ments in advocacy, export financing, market information
systems and product standards education. Our objective is
to expand U.S. exports to over $1.2 trillion by the year
2000, which would mean some 5 million new American
jobs and a total of some 16 million jobs supported by
exports by the turn of the century.

Our export strategy is working. Since this Administration
took office, the United States has regained its position from
Germany as the world’s largest exporter. We have
designed and begun implementing new approaches to
promoting exports, notably our strategy of focusing upon
the ten “Big Emerging Markets” that will take more than a
quarter of the world’s imports by the year 2010. Our
strong export performance has supported as many as 2
million new, export-related jobs since January 1993. But
we know that we need to export more in the years ahead
if we are to reduce further our trade deficit and raise living
standards with high-wage jobs.

Export Controls

Another critical element in boosting U.S. exports is
reforming the outdated export licensing system. In
September 1993, we liberalized controls on more than
$30 billion of computer exports, and in March 1994, we
eliminated controls on virtually all civilian telecommuni-
cations equipment to the former Soviet Union, Central and
Eastern Europe and China. The Administration is also
seeking comprehensive reform of the Export
Administration Act, which governs the process of export

27

 

licensing. The goal of this reform is to strengthen our ability
to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
and protect other national interests, while removing unnec-
essarily burdensome licensing requirements left over from
the Cold War. In 1995, we eliminated controls on the
export of computers to our closest allies and liberalized
controls on other computer exports consistent with our
national security interests.

Expanding the Realm of Open Markets

The conclusion of NAFTA, the Uruguay Round of GATT,
the Bogor Declaration of the 1994 APEC leaders meeting
and 1995 Osaka Action Plan, the Summit of the Americas’
Action Plan and the U.S.-EU Transatlantic Marketplace
represent unprecedented progress toward more open
markets both at the regional and global levels. The
Administration intends to continue its efforts in further
enhancing U.S. access to foreign markets. The World
Trade Organization (WTO) will provide a new institutional
lever for securing such access. Emerging markets, particu-
larly along the Pacific Rim, present vast opportunities for
American enterprise, and APEC now provides a suitable
vehicle for the exploration of such opportunities. Similarly,
the United States convened the Summit of the Americas to
seize the opportunities created by the movement toward
open markets throughout the hemisphere. The
Transatlantic Marketplace launched with the European
Union in Madrid in December 1995, will further expand
our economic ties. All such steps in the direction of
expanded trading relationships will be undertaken in a way
consistent with protection of the international environment
and towards the goal of sustainable development here and
abroad.

The North American Free Trade Agreement

On December 3, 1993, President Clinton signed the North
American Free Trade Act (NAFTA), which creates a free
trade zone among the United States, Canada and Mexico.
NAFTA has already created nearly 310,000 American jobs
because of exports to our NAFTA partners. NAFTA has also
increased Mexico’s capacity to cooperate with our nation
on a wide range of issues that cross our 2,000 mile border
— including the environment, narcotics trafficking and
illegal immigration. This Free Trade Act helped insulate our
trade relationship with Mexico and protect and increase
U.S. exports to that country — and the jobs they support

28

 

—— during the 1995 Mexican financial crisis and the subse-
quent economic recession and adjustment period. We
have also begun negotiations with Chile on expanding
NAFTA’s membership.

Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation

Our economic relations depend vitally on our ties with the
Asia Pacific region, which is the world’s fastest-growing
economic area. In November 1993, President Clinton
convened the first-ever summit of the leaders of the
economies that constitute the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum. U.S. initiatives in the APEC
forum will open new opportunities for economic coopera-
tion and permit U.S. companies to expand their involve-
ment in substantial infrastructure planning and construc-
tion throughout the region. The trade and investment
framework agreed to in 1993 provided the basis for
enhancing the ‘open regionalism’ that defines APEC. At the
second leaders meeting in November 1994, APEC leaders
embraced the goal of free and open trade and investment
throughout the region by 2020. A third meeting in Osaka,
Japan, in 1995 adopted an action agenda for facilitating
and measuring progress toward that goal.

Uruguay Round of GATT

The successful conclusion in December 1993 of the
Uruguay Round of the negotiations under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), after seven years
and three “final” deadlines, significantly strengthened the
world trading system. The Uruguay Round accord is the
largest, most comprehensive trade agreement in history. It
will reduce tariffs by 40 percent and extend trade rules to
agriculture, services and international property rights. The
U.S. economy is expected to gain $150 billion per year in
GNP once the Uruguay Round is fully phased in, which
will create hundreds of thousands of new U.S. jobs and
expand opportunities for U.S. businesses. Working with
Congress, the President secured U.S. approval of this path-
breaking agreement and the resulting World Trade
Organization, which provides a forum to resolve disputes
openly. The President remains committed to ensuring that
the commitments in the Uruguay Round agreement are
fulfilled.

 

 

U.S. - Japan Framework Agreement

The Administration continues to make progress with Asia’s
largest economy and America’s second largest trading
partner in increasing market access and strengthening
sustainable economic growth internationally. Since the
U.S.-Japan Framework for Economic Partnership was
established by President Clinton and Prime Minister
Miyazawa in 1993, we have reached 20 market access
agreements with Japan covering a range of key sectors,
such as medical technologies, telecommunications, insur-
ance, flat glass, financial services and intellectual property
rights. Our merchandise exports to Japan in the sectors
covered by these agreements have expanded at a rate that
is more than double that of export growth to Japan in the
noncovered sectors. In August 1995, we concluded a land-
mark agreement in automobile and auto parts trade, the
largest sector of our bilateral trade deficit, and last summer
we took steps to support market access for U.S. transport
services.

The Administration is committed to ensuring that competi-
tive American goods and services have fair access to the
Japanese market. In addition, the Administration is working
with Japan to address common challenges to sustainable
economic development through the Framework’s Common
Agenda for Cooperation in Global Perspective.
Partnerships have been strengthened in the environment,
human health and advanced technology development, and
new initiatives were launched this year that address educa-
tion, food security, counter-terrorism, natural disaster miti-
gation, combating emerging infectious diseases and nation-
building. This Administration will continue to seek partner-
ships that help both nations fulfill our international respon-
sibilities as the world’s two largest economies.

Summit of the Americas

America’s economy benefits enormously from the opportu-
nity offered by the commitment of the 34 democratic
nations of the Western Hemisphere to negotiate by 2005 a
Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) . The Western
Hemisphere is our largest export market, constituting over
35 percent of ali U.S. sales abroad. The action plan will
accelerate progress toward free, integrated markets that
will create new, high-wage jobs and sustain economic
growth for America. The June 1995 Trade Ministerial
created seven working groups to begin preparations for the
negotiation of the FTAA.

 

 

U.S.-EU Transatlantic Marketplace

On December 3, 1995, President Clinton launched the
New Transatlantic Agenda at the U.S.-EU Summit in
Madrid, Spain. As part of this agenda, the United States
and the European Union (EU) agreed to take concrete
steps to reduce barriers to trade and investment through
the creation of a New Transatlantic Marketplace. The
United States and the EU also will explore the possibility
of agreeing on further tariff reductions and accelerated
reductions in tariffs already agreed to in the Uruguay
Round; negotiate agreements on mutual recognition of
certification and testing procedures; conclude a customs
cooperation and mutual assistance agreement; carry out a
joint study of tariff and nontariff barriers to trade and
options for their elimination; and work together in the
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) and the WTO to achieve agreements on foreign
investment and telecommunications services.

OECD Multilateral Investment Agreement

In May 1995, the United States helped launch OECD
negotiations of a Multilateral Agreement on Investment,
which will be a state-of-the-art investment agreement. The
negotiations are intended to conclude by 1996. There is
already broad consensus that the agreement will be based
on high standards, including national and most-favored-
nation treatment, and that exceptions would be limited
and narrowly drawn. We are seeking to establish clear
legal standards on expropriation, access to binding interna-
tional arbitration for disputes and unrestricted investment-
related transfers across borders. If successful, these negotia-
tions would help further our efforts on investment issues in
Asia and in the WTO.

Preparing International Economic Institutions
for the 21st Century

At the initiative of President Clinton at the Naples
Economic Summit in 1994, the G-7 undertook an inten-
sive review of the international financial and economic
institutions to consider how to prepare them for the 21st
Century. At the following year’s summit in Halifax,
Canada, the G-7 proposed a number of important reforms
and initiatives. These include measures to improve our
capacity to prevent and mitigate international financial
crises; the creation of a more effective early warning and

29

 

 

 

prevention system with an emphasis on improved disclo-
sure of financial and economic data; the establishment of a
new Emergency Financing Mechanism to provide the
means for a quick and surgical international response to
crises with systemic implications; a doubling of the
resources available under the General Arrangement to
Borrow, including from new participants with a stake in
the system; and instituting a review of procedures that
might facilitate the orderly resolution of international debt
crises in a financial environment characterized by a greater
diversity of creditors and financial instruments. Another
important area considered at Halifax concerns interna-
tional financial regulation. The G-7 leaders committed to
intensify cooperation among financial authorities to limit
systemic risk and pledged to develop and enhance safe-
guards, standards, transparency and systems to reduce risk.

At Halifax, the G-7 leaders also endorsed a blueprint for
reforms of the World Bank and the regional development
banks — reforms that the United States has been
promoting for two and a half years. Key elements include:
substantially increasing the share of resources devoted to
basic social programs that invest in people and are a
powerful force for poverty reduction, such as primary
education for girls and basic health care; focus on safe-
guarding the environment; support for development of the
private sector and the use of more innovative financial
instruments to catalyze private capital flows; and internal
réforms of the multilateral development banks, including
consolidation, decentralization, increased transparency
and cost reduction.

Providing for Energy Security

The United States depends on oil for more than 40% of its
primary energy needs. Roughly half of our oil needs are
met with imports, and a large share of these imports come
from the Persian Gulf area. The experiences of the two oil
shocks and the Gulf War show that an interruption of oil
supplies can have a significant impact on the economies of
the United States and its allies. Appropriate economic
responses can substantially mitigate the balance of
payments and inflationary impacts of an oil shock; appro-
priate security policy responses to events such as Iraq’s
invasion of Kuwait can limit the magnitude of the crisis.

Over the longer term, the United States’ dependence on

access to foreign oil sources will be increasingly important
as our resources are depleted. The U.S. economy has

30

 

grown roughly 75% since the first oil shock; yet during
that time our oil consumption has remained virtually stable
and oil production has declined. High oil prices did not
generate enough new oil exploration and discovery to
sustain production levels from our depleted resource base.
These facts show the need for continued and extended
reliance on energy efficiency and conservation and devel-
opment of alternative energy sources. Conservation
measures notwithstanding, the United States has a vital
interest in unrestricted access to this critical resource.

Promoting Sustainable Development
Abroad

Broad-based economic development not only improves
the prospects for democratic development in developing
countries but also expands the demands for U.S. exports.
Economic growth abroad can alleviate pressure on the
global environment, reduce the attraction of illegal
narcotics trade and improve the health and economic
productivity of global populations.

The environmental consequences of ill-designed economic
growth are clear. Environmental damage will ultimately
block economic growth. Rapid urbanization is outstripping
the ability of nations to provide jobs, education and other
services to new citizens. The continuing poverty of a
quarter of the world’s people leads to hunger, malnutri-
tion, economic migration and political unrest. Widespread
illiteracy and lack of technical skills hinder employment
opportunities and drive entire populations to support
themselves on increasingly fragile and damaged resource
bases. New diseases, such as AIDS, and other epidemics
which can be spread through environmental degradation,
threaten to overwhelm the health facilities of developing
countries, disrupt societies and stop economic growth.
Developing countries must address these realities with
national sustainable development policies that offer viable
alternatives. U.S. leadership is of the essence to facilitate
that process. If such alternatives are not developed, the
consequences for the planet's future will be grave indeed.

 

Domestically, the United States is working hard to halt
local and cross-border environmental degradation. In addi-
tion, the United States is fostering environmental tech-
nology that targets pollution prevention, control and
cleanup. Companies that invest in energy efficiency, clean
manufacturing and environmental services today will

 

 

create the high-quality, high-wage jobs of tomorrow. By
providing access to these types of technologies, our exports
can also provide the means for other nations to achieve
environmentally sustainable economic growth. At the same
time, we are taking ambitious steps at home to better
manage our natural resources and reduce energy and other
consumption, decrease waste generation and increase our
recycling efforts.

Internationally, the Administration’s foreign assistance
program focuses on four key elements of sustainable devel-
opment: broad-based economic growth; the environment;
population and health; and democracy. We will continue
to advocate environmentally sound private investment and
responsible approaches by international lenders. As
mentioned above, the Multilateral Development Banks
(MDB’s) are now placing increased emphasis upon sustain-
able development in their funding decisions, to include a
commitment to perform environmental assessments on
projects for both internal and public scrutiny. In particular,
the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), established in
1994, provides a source of financial assistance to the
developing world for climate change, biodiversity and
oceans initiatives that will benefit all the world’s citizens,
including Americans.

The United States is taking specific steps in all of these
areas:

* In June 1993, the United States signed the
Convention on Biological Diversity, which aims to
protect and utilize the world’s genetic inheritance.
The Interior Department created a National
Biological Service to help protect species and to help
the agricultural and biotechnical industries identify
new sources of food, fiber and medications.

* New policies are being implemented to ensure the
sustainable management of U.S. forests by the year
2000, as pledged internationally. In addition, U.S.
bilateral forest assistance programs are being
expanded, and the United States is promoting
sustainable management of tropical forests.

* Inthe wake of the 1992 United Nations Conference
on Environment and Development, the United States
has undertaken initiatives to reduce land-based
sources of marine pollution, maintain populations of
marine species at healthy and productive levels and
protect endangered marine mammals and coral reefs.

 

¢ The United States has focused technical assistance

and encouraged nongovernmental environmental
groups to provide expertise to the new independent
states of the former Soviet Union and Central and
Eastern European nations that have suffered the most
acute environmental crises. The Agency for
International Development, the Environmental
Protection Agency and other U.S. agencies are
engaged in technical cooperation with many coun-
tries around the world to advance these goals. The
United States has also been working bilaterally with
a number of developing countries to promote their
sustainable development and to work jointly on
global environmental issues.

The Administration is leading a renewed global effort
to address population problems and promote inter-
national consensus for stabilizing world population
growth. Our comprehensive approach stresses family
planning and reproductive health care, maternal and
child health, education and improving the status of
women. The 1994 International Conference on
Population and Development held in Cairo,
endorsed these approaches as important strategies in
achieving our global population goals. At the 1995
UN Conference on Women in Beijing, the United
States promoted women’s — and children’s — inter-
national rights.

With regard to the United Nations, the G-7 leaders at
the Halifax Summit in 1995 endorsed an ambitious
effort to modernize the organization’s economic and
social functions through better coordination, consoli-
dation of related agencies, rethinking agency
mandates and creating an effective management
culture in a smaller and more focused Secretariat.
Following President Clinton’s call for a UN reform
commission, the UN General Assembly established
the High Level Working Group on Strengthening the
UN System in September 1995.

In April 1993, President Clinton pledged that the
United States would reduce our greenhouse gas
emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, in accor-
dance with the Framework Convention on Climate
Change. In March 1995, we and other parties to the
Convention agreed to negotiate steps to be taken
beyond the year 2000. We are resolved to deal
forcefully with this threat to our planet while
preserving U.S. economic competitiveness.

31

 

* The United States and other countries have agreed to
protect the ozone layer by phasing out use of the
major ozone-depleting substances. In 1995, we also
agreed with other nations to decrease use of addi-
tional ozone-depleting chemicals.

Promoting Democracy

All of America’s strategic interests — from promoting pros-
perity at home to checking global threats abroad before
they threaten our territory — are served by enlarging the
community of democratic and free-market nations. Thus,
working with new democratic states to help preserve them
as democracies committed to free markets and respect for
human rights, is a key part of our national security strategy.

One of the most gratifying and encouraging developments
of the past 15 years is the explosion in the number of states
moving away from repressive governance and toward
democracy. Since the success of many of those experi-
ments is by no means assured, our strategy of enlargement
must focus on the consolidation of those regimes and the
broadening of their commitment to democracy. At the
same time, we seek to increase respect for fundamental
human rights in all states and encourage an evolution to
democracy where that is possible.

The enlargement of the community of market democracies
respecting human rights and the environment is manifest
in a number of ways:

* More than 30 nations in Central and Eastern Europe,
the former Soviet Union, Latin America, Africa and
East Asia have, over the past 10 years, adopted the
structures of a constitutional democracy and held
free elections;

* The nations of the Western Hemisphere have
proclaimed their commitment to democratic regimes
and to the collective responsibility of the nations of
the OAS to respond to threats to democracy.

* Inthe Western Hemisphere, only Cuba is not a
democratic state.

* Nations as diverse as South Africa and Cambodia

have resolved bitter internal disputes with agreement
on the creation of constitutional democracies.

32

 

The first element of our enlargement strategy is to work
with the other democracies of the world and to improve
our cooperation with them on security and economic
issues. We also seek their support in enlarging the realm of
democratic nations.

The core of our strategy is to help democracy and free-
markets expand and survive in other places where we
have the strongest security concerns and where we can
make the greatest difference. This is not a democratic
crusade; it is a pragmatic commitment to see freedom take
hold where that will help us most. Thus, we must target
our effort to assist states that affect our strategic interests,
such as those with large economies, critical locations,
nuclear weapons or the potential to generate refugee flows
into our own nation or into key friends and allies. We
must focus our efforts where we have the most leverage.
And our efforts must be demand-driven — they must focus
on nations whose people are pushing for reform or have
already secured it.

Russia is a key state in this regard. If we can support and
help consolidate democratic and market reforms in Russia
— and in the other new independent states — we can
help turn a former threat into a region of valued diplomatic
and economic partnership. Our intensified interaction with
Ukraine has helped move that country onto the path of
economic reform, which is critical to its long-term stability.
In addition, our efforts in Russia, Ukraine and the other
states support and facilitate our efforts to achieve
continued reductions in nuclear arms and compliance
with international nonproliferation accords.

The new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe are
another clear example, given their proximity to the great
democratic powers of Western Europe, their importance to
our security and their potential markets. Eventual integra-
tion into European security and economic organizations,
such as NATO and the EU, will help lock in and preserve
the impressive progress in instituting democratic and
market-economic reforms that these nations have made.

Since our ties across the Pacific are no less important than
those across the Atlantic, pursuing enlargement in the Asia
Pacific theater is a third example. We will work to support
the emerging democracies of the region and to encourage
other states along the same path.

 

 

Continuing the great strides toward democracy and
markets in our hemisphere is also a key concern and was
behind the President's decision to host the Summit of the
Americas in December 1994. As we continue such efforts,
we should be on the lookout for states whose entry into
the camp of market democracies may influence the future
direction of an entire region; South Africa now holds that
potential with regard to sub-Saharan Africa.

How should the United States help consolidate and
enlarge democracy and markets in these states? The
answers are as varied as the nations involved, but there are
common elements. We must continue to help lead the
effort to mobilize international resources, as we have with
Russia, Ukraine and the other new independent states. We
must be willing to take immediate public positions to help
staunch democratic reversals, as we have in Haiti and
Guatemala. We must give democratic nations the fullest
benefits of integration into foreign markets, which is part of
why NAFTA and the Uruguay Round of GATT ranked so
high on our agenda. And we must help these nations
strengthen the pillars of civil society, improve their market
institutions and fight corruption and political discontent
through practices of good governance.

At the same time as we work to ensure the success of
emerging democracies, we must also redouble our efforts
to guarantee basic human rights on a global basis. At the
1993 United Nations Conference on Human Rights, the
United States forcefully and successfully argued for a reaf-
firmation of the universality of such rights and improved
international mechanisms for their promotion. In the wake
of this gathering, the UN has named a High Commissioner
for Human Rights, and the rights of women have been
afforded a new international precedence. The United
States has taken the lead in assisting the UN to set up inter-
national tribunals to enforce accountability for the war
crimes in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda. And the
President has endorsed the creation of a Permanent
Criminal Court to address violations of international
humanitarian law.

The United States also continues to work for the protection
of human rights on a bilateral basis. To demonstrate our
own willingness to adhere to international human rights
standards, the United States ratified the international
convention prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race
and the President signed the international convention on
the rights of the child. The Administration is seeking Senate

 

 

consent to ratification for the convention prohibiting
discrimination against women. The United States played a
major role in promoting women’s rights internationally at
the UN Women’s Conference in September.

In all these efforts, a policy of engagement and enlarge-
ment should take on a second meaning: we should pursue
our goals through an enlarged circle not only of govern-
ment officials but also of private and nongovernmental
groups. Private firms are natural allies in our efforts to
strengthen market economies. Similarly, our goal of
strengthening democracy and civil society has a natural
ally in labor unions, human rights groups, environmental
advocates, chambers of commerce and election monitors.
Just as we rely on force multipliers in defense, we should
welcome these diplomacy multipliers, such as the
National Endowment for Democracy.

Supporting the global movement toward democracy
requires a pragmatic and long-term effort focused on both
values and institutions. The United States must build on
the opportunities achieved through the successful conclu-
sion of the Cold War, Our long-term goal is a world in
which each of the major powers is democratic, with many
other nations joining the community of market democra-
cies as well.

Our efforts to promote democracy and human rights are
complemented by our humanitarian assistance programs
which are designed to alleviate human suffering and to
pave the way for progress towards establishing democratic
regimes with a commitment to respect for human rights
and appropriate strategies for economic development. We
are encouraging ideas such as the suggestion of
Argentina’s President Menem for the creation of an inter-
national civilian rapid response capability for humanitarian
crises, including a school and training for humanitarian
operations.

Through humanitarian assistance and policy initiatives
aimed at the sources of disruption, we seek to mitigate the
contemporary migration and refugee crises, foster long-
term global cooperation and strengthen involved interna-
tional institutions. The United States will provide appro-
priate financial support and will work with other nations
and international bodies, such as the International Red
Cross and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, in
seeking voluntary repatriation of refugees — taking into
full consideration human rights concerns as well as the

33

economic conditions that may have driven them out in the
first place. Helping refugees return to their homes in
Mozambique, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia and
Guatemala, for example, is a high priority.

Relief efforts will continue for people displaced by the

conflict in Bosnia and other republics of the former
Yugoslavia. We will act in concert with other nations and

34

the UN against the illegal smuggling of aliens into this
country. In concert with the tools of diplomatic, economic
and military power, our humanitarian and refugee policies
can bear results, as was evident in Haiti. We provided
temporary safe haven at Guantanamo Naval Base for those
Haitians who feared for their safety and left by sea until we
helped restore democracy.

 

 

 

Ill. Integrated Regional Approaches

The United States is a genuinely global power. Our policy
toward each of the world’s regions reflects our overall
strategy tailored to their unique challenges and opportuni-
ties. This section highlights the application of our strategy
to each of the world’s regions; our broad objectives and
thrust, rather than an exhaustive list of all our policies and
interests. It illustrates how we integrate our commitment to
the promotion of democracy and the enhancement of
American prosperity with our security requirements to
produce a mutually reinforcing policy.

Europe and Eurasia

Our strategy of engagement and enlargement is central to
U.S. policy toward Europe. European stability is vital to our
own security, a lesson we have learned twice at great cost
this century. Vibrant European economies mean more jobs
for Americans at home and investment opportunities
abroad. With the collapse of the Soviet empire and the
emergence of many new democratizing states in its wake,
the United States has an unparalleled opportunity to
contribute toward a free and undivided Europe. Our goal is
an integrated democratic Europe cooperating with the
United States to keep the peace and promote prosperity.

The first and most important element of our strategy in
Europe must be security through military strength and
cooperation. The Cold War is over, but war itself is not
over.

We must work with our allies to ensure that the hard-won
peace in the former Yugoslavia will survive and flourish
after four years of war. U.S. policy is focused on five goals:

 

sustaining a political settlement in Bosnia that preserves the
country’s territorial integrity and provides a viable future
for all its peoples; preventing the spread of the conflict into
a broader Balkan war that could threaten both allies and
the stability of new democratic states in Central and
Eastern Europe; stemming the destabilizing flow of refugees
from the conflict; halting the slaughter of innocents; and
helping to support NATO’s central role in Europe while
maintaining our role in shaping Europe's security architec-
ture.

Our leadership paved the way to NATO's February 1994
ultimatum that ended the heavy Serb bombardment of
Sarajevo, Bosnia’s capital. Our diplomatic leadership then
brought an end to the fighting between the Muslims and
Croats in Bosnia and helped establish a bicommunal
Bosnian-Croat Federation. In April 1994, we began
working with the warring parties through the Contact
Group (United States, Russia, United Kingdom, France and
Germany) to help the parties reach a negotiated settlement.

This past summer, following Bosnian Serb attacks on the
safe areas of Srebrenica and Zepa and in response to the
brutal shelling of Sarajevo, the United States led NATO's
heavy and continuous air strikes. At the same time,
President Clinton launched a new diplomatic initiative
aimed at ending the conflict for good. Intensive diplomatic
efforts by our negotiators forged a Bosnia-wide cease-fire
and got the parties to agree to the basic principles of
peace. Three dedicated American diplomats — Robert
Frasure, Joseph Kruzel and Nelson Drew — lost their lives
in that effort.

35

Three intensive weeks of negotiations, led by the United
States last November, produced the Dayton Peace
Agreement. In the agreement, the parties committed to put
down their guns; to preserve Bosnia as a single state; to
investigate and prosecute war criminals; to protect the
human rights of all citizens; and to try to build a peaceful,
democratic future. And they asked for help from the
United States and the international community in imple-
menting the peace agreement.

Following the signature of the peace agreement in Paris on
December 14, U.S. forces deployed to Bosnia as part of a
NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR). These
forces, along with those of some 25 other nations,
including all of our NATO allies, are working to ensure a
stable and secure environment so that the parties have the
confidence to carry out their obligations under the Dayton
agreement. IFOR’s task is limited to assisting the parties in
implementing the military aspects of the peace agreement,
including monitoring the cease-fire, monitoring and
enforcing the withdrawal of forces and establishing and
manning the zone of separation.

We anticipate a one-year mission for IFOR in Bosnia. The
parties to the agreement have specific dates by which each
stage of their obligations must be carried out, which started
with the separation of forces within 30 days after IFOR
assumed authority from UNPROFOR, and continuing with
the removal of forces and heavy weapons to garrisons
within 120 days.

During the second six months, IFOR will continue to main-
tain a stable and secure environment and prepare for and
undertake an orderly drawdown of forces, while the parties
themselves will continue to work with the international
community to carry out the nonmilitary activities called for
by the agreement. We believe that by the end of the first
year we will have helped create a secure environment so
that the people of Bosnia can travel freely throughout the
country, vote in free elections and begin to rebuild their
lives.

Civilian tasks of rebuilding, reconstruction, return of
refugees and human rights monitoring, which are
absolutely essential to making the peace endure, have
been undertaken by the entire international community
under civilian coordination. International aid agencies are
helping the people of Bosnia rebuild to meet the imme-
diate needs of survival. There also is a long-term interna-

36

 

tional reconstruction effort to repair the devastation
brought about by years of war. This broad civilian effort is
helping the people of Bosnia to rebuild, reuniting children
with their parents and families with their homes and will
allow the Bosnian people to choose freely their own
leaders. It will give them a much greater stake in peace
than war, so that peace takes on a life and a logic of its
own.

We expect to contribute some $600 million over the next
3-4 years to reconstruction and relief funding. In view of
the large role that U.S. forces are playing in implementing
the military aspects of the agreement, we believe it is
appropriate for Europe to contribute the largest share of the
funds for reconstruction. The European Union has taken
the lead in these efforts in tandem with the international
financial institutions, in particular the World Bank. The
Japanese and Islamic countries also are prepared to make
significant contributions.

An important element of our exit strategy for IFOR is our
commitment to achieving a stable military balance within
Bosnia and among the states of the former Yugoslavia by
the time IFOR withdraws. This balance will help reduce
the incentives of the parties to return to war. This balance
should be achieved, to the extent possible, through arms
limitations and reductions, and the Dayton agreement
contains significant measures in this regard.

But even with the implementation of the arms control
provisions, the armed forces of the Federation, which have
been the most severely constrained by the arms embargo,
will still be at a disadvantage. Accordingly, we have made
a commitment to the Bosnian government that we will
play a leadership role in ensuring that the Federation
receives the assistance necessary to adequately defend
itself when IFOR leaves. However, because we want to
assure the impartiality of IFOR, providing arms and
training to Federation forces will not be done by either
IFOR or U.S. military forces. The approach we intend to
pursue for the United States is to coordinate the efforts of
third countries and to lead an international effort, with U.S.
involvement in the execution of the program to be done
by contractors.

 

Our efforts in this connection already have begun. An
assessment team to evaluate the needs of the Federation
visited Bosnia in November 1995 and made recommenda-
tions regarding the Federation’s defense requirements. A

 

special task force has been established at the Department
of State to work with other interested states and to identify
the best sources of essential equipment and training. We
will proceed with this effort in a manner that is consistent
with the UN resolution lifting the arms embargo, which
allows planning and training to proceed immediately but
prohibits the introduction of weapons to the region for
three months and the transfer of heavy weapons for six
months.

As we work to resolve the tragedy of Bosnia and ease the
suffering of its victims, we also need to transform European
and transatlantic institutions so they can better address
such conflicts and advance Europe’s integration. Many
institutions will play a role, including the European Union
(EU), the Western European Union (WEU), the Council of
Europe (CE), the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE) and the United Nations. But NATO,
history’s greatest political-military alliance, must be central
to that process.

The NATO alliance will remain the anchor of American
engagement in Europe and the linchpin of transatlantic
security. That is why we must keep it strong, vital and rele-
vant. For the United States and its allies, NATO has always
been far more than a transitory response to a temporary
threat. It has been a guarantor of European democracy and
a force for European stability. That is why its mission
endures even though the Cold War has receded into the
past. And that is why its benefits are so clear to Europe’s
new democracies.

Only NATO has the military forces, the integrated
command structure, the broad legitimacy and the habits of
cooperation that are essential to draw in new participants
and respond to new challenges. One of the deepest trans-
formations within the transatlantic community over the
past half-century occurred because the armed forces of our
respective nations trained, studied and marched through
their careers together. It is not only the compatibility of our
weapons but the camaraderie of our warriors that provide
the sinews behind our mutual security guarantees and our
best hope for peace. In this regard, we applaud France's
decision to resume its participation in NATO's defense
councils.

The United States has significantly reduced the level of
U.S. military forces stationed in Europe. We have deter-
mined that a force of roughly 100,000 U.S. military

 

personnel assigned to the U.S. European Command will
preserve U.S. influence and leadership in NATO and
provide a deterrent posture that is visible to all Europeans.
While we continue to examine the proper mix of forces,
this level of permanent presence, augmented by forward
deployed naval forces and reinforcements available from
the United States, is sufficient to respond to plausible crises
and contributes to stability in the region. Such a force level
also provides a sound basis for U.S. participation in multi-
national training and preserves the capability to deter or
respond to larger threats in Europe and to support limited
NATO operations out of area.

NATO's mission is evolving, and the Alliance will
continue to adapt to the many changes brought about in
the aftermath of the end of the Cold War. Today, NATO
plays a crucial role helping to manage ethnic and national
conflict in Europe. With U.S. leadership, NATO has
provided the muscle behind efforts to bring about a
peaceful settlement in the former Yugoslavia. NATO air
power enforced the UN-mandated no-fly zone and
provided support to UN peacekeepers. NATO is now
helping to implement the peace after the parties reached
an agreement.

With the adoption of the U.S. initiative, Partnership for
Peace, at the January 1994 summit, NATO is playing an
increasingly important role in our strategy of European
integration, extending the scope of our security coopera-
tion to the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union. 27 nations, including Russia,
have already joined the Partnership, which will pave the
way for a growing program of military cooperation and
political consultation. Partner countries are sending repre-
sentatives to NATO headquarters near Brussels and to a
military coordination cell at Mons — the site of Supreme
Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). Combined
exercises have taken place in virtually all of the Partners’
countries and NATO nations. In keeping with our strategy
of enlargement, PFP is open to all former members of the
Warsaw Pact as well as other European states. Each
partner will set the scope and pace of its cooperation with
NATO. To facilitate progress toward PFP objectives, the
U.S. Warsaw Initiative Program is directing $100 million
to Partner nations this year.

The success of NATO’s Partnership for Peace process and

the increasing links developed between NATO and Partner
nations have also begun to lay the foundation for the

37

Partners to contribute to real-world NATO missions such
as the IFOR operation, Joint Endeavor. The participation of
over a dozen Partner nations in IFOR demonstrates the
value of our efforts to date and will contribute to the
further integration of Europe.

The North Atlantic Treaty has always been open to the
addition of members who shared the Alliance’s purposes
and its values, its commitment to respect borders and inter-
national law and who could add to its strength; indeed,
NATO has expanded three times since its creation. In
January 1994, President Clinton made it plain that “the
question is no longer whether NATO will take on new
members but when and how we will do so.” The following
December, we and our Allies began a steady, measured
and transparent process that will lead to NATO enlarge-
ment. During 1995, the Alliance carried out the first phase
in this process, by conducting a study of the process and
principles that would guide the bringing in of new
members. This enlargement.study was completed in
September 1995 and presented to interested members of
the Partnership for Peace (PFP).

At its December 1995 foreign ministers meeting in
Brussels, NATO announced the launching of the second
phase of the enlargement process. All interested members
of the Partnership for Peace will be invited, beginning in
early 1996, to participate in intensive bilateral consulta-
tions with NATO aimed at helping them prepare for
possible NATO membership. Participation will not guar-
antee that a participant will be invited to begin accession
talks with NATO. Any such decision will be taken by
NATO at a time of its own choosing, based on an overall
assessment of Alliance security and interests. As part of this
phase, NATO will also expand and deepen the Partnership
for Peace, both as a means to further the enlargement
process, but also to intensify relations between NATO and
all members of the PFP. The second phase in the enlarge-
ment process will continue through 1996 and be reviewed
and assessed by NATO foreign ministers at their December
1996 meeting.

Enlarging the Alliance will promote our interests by
reducing the risk of instability or conflict in Europe’s
eastern half — the region where two world wars and the
Cold War began. It will help assure that no part of Europe
will revert to a zone of great power competition or a
sphere of influence. It will build confidence and give new
democracies a powerful incentive to consolidate their
reforms. And each potential member will be judged

38

 

according to the strength of its democratic institutions and
its capacity to contribute to the goals of the Alliance.

As the President has made clear, NATO enlargement will
not be aimed at replacing one division of Europe with a
new one; rather, its purpose is to enhance the security of
all European states, members and nonmembers alike. In
this regard, we have a major stake in ensuring that Russia
is engaged as a vital participant in European security
affairs. We are committed to a growing, healthy NATO-
Russia relationship, including a mechanism for regular
consultations on common concerns. The current NATO-
Russia cooperation on Bosnia is a great stride forward.
Also, we want to see Russia closely involved in the
Partnership for Peace. Recognizing that no single institu-
tion can meet every challenge to peace and stability in
Europe, we have begun a process that will strengthen the
OSCE and enhance its conflict prevention and peace-
keeping capabilities.

The second element of the new strategy for Europe is
economic. The United States seeks to build on vibrant and
open-market economies, the engines that have given us
the greatest prosperity in human history over the last
several decades in Europe and in the United States. To this
end, we strongly support the process of European integra-
tion embodied in the European Union and seek to deepen
our partnership with the EU in support of our economic
goals, but also commit ourselves to the encouragement of
bilateral trade and investment in countries not part of the
EU. The United States supports appropriate enlargement of
the European Union and welcomes the European Union's
Customs Union with Turkey.

 

The nations of the European Union face particularly signifi-
cant economic challenges with nearly 20 million people
unemployed and, in Germany's case, the extraordinarily
high costs of unification. Among the Atlantic nations,
economic stagnation has clearly eroded public support in
finances for outward-looking foreign policies and for
greater integration. We are working closely with our West
European partners to expand employment and promote
long-term growth, building on the results of the Detroit
Jobs Conference and the Naples G-7 Summit in 1994. In
December 1995, the U.S. and EU launched the New
Transatlantic Agenda, which moves the U.S.-EU relation-
ship from consultation to joint action on a range of shared
interests, including promoting peace, stability, democracy
and development; responding to global challenges; and
contributing to the expansion of world trade and closer
economic relations.

 

In Northern Ireland, the Administration is implementing a
package of initiatives to promote the peace process,
including a successful trade mission, a management intern
exchange program and cooperation to promote tourism.
The White House Conference on Trade and Investment,
held in May 1995, has led to new partnerships between
firms in the United States and Northern Ireland that benefit
both economies. The President's visit to Northern Ireland
in November 1995, the first ever by an American
President, drew an unprecedented wave of popular
support for peace. We are continuing our support for
investment and trade in Northern Ireland to create jobs
that will underpin hopes for peace and reconciliation.

As we work to strengthen our own economies, we must
know that we serve our own prosperity and our security by
helping the new market reforms in the new democracies in
Europe's East, which will help to deflate the region’s
demagogues. It will help ease ethnic tensions; it will help
new democracies take root.

In Russia, Ukraine and the other new independent states of
the former Soviet Union, the economic transformation they
are undertaking is historical. The Russian Government has
made substantial progress toward privatizing the economy
(over 60 percent of the Russian Gross Domestic Product is
now generated by the private sector) and reducing infla-
tion, and Ukraine has taken bold steps of its own to insti-
tute much-needed economic reforms. But much remains
to be done to build on the reform momentum to assure
durable economic recovery and social protection.
President Clinton has given strong and consistent support
to this unprecedented reform effort and has mobilized the
international community to provide structural economic
assistance; for example, by securing agreement by the G-7
to make available four billion dollars in grants and loans as
Ukraine has implemented economic reform. Through the
Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, the United States is
working closely with Russia in priority areas, including
defense, trade and science and technology.

The short-term difficulties of taking Central and Eastern
Europe into Western economic institutions will be more
than rewarded if they succeed and if they are customers
for America’s and Western Europe’s goods and services
tomorrow. That is why this Administration has been
committed to increase support substantially for market
reforms in the new states of the former Soviet Union and
why we have continued our support for economic transi-

 

tion in Central and Eastern Europe, while also paying
attention to measures that can overcome the social dislo-
cations which have resulted largely from the collapse of
the Soviet-dominated regional trading system. One step
was a White House sponsored Trade and Investment
Conference for Central and Eastern Europe, which took
place in Cleveland in January, 1995.

Ultimately, the success of market reforms to the East will
depend more on trade and investment than official aid. No
one nation has enough resources to markedly change the
future of those countries as they move to free market
systems. One of our priorities, therefore, is to reduce trade
barriers with the former communist states.

The third and final imperative of this new strategy is to
support the growth of democracy and individual freedoms
that has begun in Russia, the nations of the former Soviet
Union and Europe’s former communist states. The success
of these democratic reforms makes us all more secure;
they are the best answer to the aggressive nationalism and
ethnic hatreds unleashed by the end of the Cold War.
Nowhere is democracy’s success more important to us all
than in these countries.

This will be the work of generations. There will be wrong
turns and even reversals, as there have been in all coun-
tries throughout history. But as long as these states
continue their progress toward democracy and respect the
rights of their own and other people, and they understand
the rights of their minorities and their neighbors, we will
support their progress with a steady patience.

East Asia and the Pacific

East Asia is a region of growing importance for U.S. secu-
rity and prosperity; nowhere are the strands of our three-
pronged strategy more intertwined nor is the need for
continued U.S. engagement more evident. Now more than
ever, security, open markets and democracy go hand in
hand in our approach to this dynamic region. In 1993,
President Clinton laid out an integrated strategy — a New
Pacific Community — which links security requirements
with economic realities and our concern for democracy
and human rights.

In thinking about Asia, we must remember that security is
the first pillar of our new Pacific community. The United

39

 

States is a Pacific nation. We have fought three wars there
in this century. To deter regional aggression and secure our
own interests, we will maintain an active presence, and we
will continue to lead. Our deep, bilateral ties with such
allies as Japan, South Korea, Australia, Thailand and the
Philippines, and a continued American military presence
will serve as the foundation for America’s security role in
the region. Currently, our forces number nearly 100,000
personnel in East Asia. In addition to performing the
general forward deployment functions outlined above, they
contribute to regional stability by deterring aggression and
adventurism.

As a key element of our strategic commitment to the
region, we are pursuing stronger efforts to combat the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction on the Korean
Peninsula. In October 1994, we reached an important
Agreed Framework committing North Korea to halt and
eventually eliminate, its existing, dangerous nuclear
program — and an agreement with China, restricting the
transfer of ballistic missiles.

Another example of our security commitment to the Asia
Pacific region in this decade is our effort to develop
multiple new arrangements to meet multiple threats and
opportunities. We have supported new regional dialogues
— such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) — on the full
range of common security challenges. The second ARF
Ministerial, held in August 1995, made significant progress
in addressing key security issues such as the Korean
Peninsula and the South China Sea. It also agreed to inters-
essional meetings on confidence-building measures such
as search and rescue cooperation and peacekeeping. Such
regional arrangements can enhance regional security and
understanding through improved confidence and trans-
parency. These regional exchanges are grounded on the
strong network of bilateral relationships that exist today.

The continuing tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain
the principal threat to the peace and stability of the Asian
region. We have worked diligently with our South Korean
and Japanese allies, with the People’s Republic of China
and with Russia, and with various UN organizations to
resolve the problem of North Korea’s nuclear program.
Throughout 1995, we successfully took the initial steps to
implement the U.S.-North Korea nuclear agreement, begin-
ning with [AEA monitoring of the North Korean nuclear
freeze of its plutonium reprocessing plant and of its
construction of two larger plants and an expanded repro-

40

 

cessing facility. In March 1995, a U.S.-led effort with Japan
and the Republic of Korea successfully established the
Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization
(KEDO), which will finance and supply the light-water
reactor project to North Korea. The reactor will, over a ten-
year period, replace North Korea’s more dangerous, pluto-
nium producing reactors. In December 1995, KEDO and
North Korea reached agreement on a comprehensive
supply contract for the light-water reactor project as part of
the overall plan to replace North Korea’s existing,
dangerous nuclear program. KEDO also supplied heavy
fuel oil to offset the energy from the frozen reactor projects
and took measures to safely store spent nuclear fuel in
North Korea, pending its final removal under the terms of
the Agreed Framework. That effort will be accompanied by
a willingness to improve bilateral political and economic
ties with the North, commensurate with their continued
cooperation to resolve the nuclear issue and to make
progress on other issues of concern, such as improved
North-South Korean relations and missile proliferation. Our
goal remains a non-nuclear, peacefully reunified Korean
Peninsula. Our strong and active commitment to our South
Korean allies and to the region is the foundation of this
effort.

A stable, open, prosperous and strong China is important
to the United States and to our friends and allies in the
region. A stable and open China is more likely to work
cooperatively with others and to contribute positively to
peace in the region and to respect the rights and interests
of its people. A prosperous China will provide an
expanding market for American goods and services. We
have a profound stake in helping to ensure that China
pursues its modernization in ways that contribute to the
overall security and prosperity of the Asia Pacific region.
To that end, we strongly promote China’s participation in
regional security mechanisms to reassure its neighbors and
assuage its own security concerns.

In support of these objectives, we have adopted a policy of
comprehensive engagement designed to integrate China
into the international community as a responsible member
and to foster bilateral cooperation in areas of common
interest. At the same time, we are seeking to resolve impor-
tant differences in areas of concern to the United States,
such as human rights, proliferation and trade. The United
States continues to follow its long-standing “one China”
policy; at the same time, we maintain fruitful unofficial
relations with the people in Taiwan, a policy that

 

 

 

contributes to regional security and economic dynamism.
We have made clear that the resolution of issues between
Taiwan and the PRC should be peaceful.

On July 11, 1995, the President normalized relations with
Vietnam. This step was taken in recognition of the progress
that had been made in accounting for missing Americans
from the Vietnam war and to encourage continued
progress by Vietnam in the accounting process. This action
also served to help bring Vietnam into the community of
nations. Vietnam’s strategic position in Southeast Asia
makes it a pivotal player in ensuring a stable and peaceful
region. In expanding dialogue with Vietnam, the United
States will continue to encourage it along the path toward
economic reform and democracy, with its entry into
ASEAN a move along this path.

The second pillar of our engagement in Asia is our
commitment to continuing and enhancing the economic
prosperity that has characterized the region. Opportunities
for economic progress continue to abound in Asia and
underlie our strong commitment to multilateral economic
cooperation, principally through APEC. Today, the 18
member states of APEC — comprising about one-third of
the world’s population, including Mexico and Canada —
produce $13 trillion and export $1.7 trillion of goods
annually, about one-half of the world’s totals. U.S. exports
to Asian economies reached $150 billion in 1994,
supporting nearly 2.9 million American jobs. U.S. direct
investments in Asia totaled over $108 billion — about
one-fifth of total U.S. direct foreign investment. A pros-
perous and open Asia Pacific is key to the economic
health of the United States. Annual APEC leaders meetings,
initiated in 1993 by President Clinton, are vivid testi-
monies to the possibilities of stimulating regional
economic cooperation. As confidence in APEC’s potential
grows, it will pay additional dividends in enhancing polit-
ical and security ties within the region.

We are also working with our major bilateral trade part-
ners to improve trade relations. The U.S. and Japan have
successfully completed 20 bilateral trade agreements in the
wake of the 1993 Framework Agreement, designed to
open Japan’s markets more to competitive U.S. goods and
reduce the U.S. trade deficit. As U.S.-China trade
continues to grow significantly, we must work closely with
Beijing to resolve remaining bilateral and multilateral trade
problems, such as intellectual property rights and market
access. In February 1995, the United States reached a

 

bilateral agreement with China on intellectual property
rights, potentially saving U.S. companies billions of dollars
in revenues lost because of piracy. China’s accession to
the WTO is also an important objective for the United
States. The United States and other WTO members have
made it clear that China must join the WTO on commer-
cial terms.

The third pillar of our policy in building a new Pacific
community is to support democratic reform in the region.
The new democratic states of Asia will have our strong
support as they move forward to consolidate and expand
democratic reforms.

Some have argued that democracy is somehow unsuited
for Asia or at least for some Asian nations — that human
rights are relative and that they simply mask Western
cultural imperialism. These arguments are wrong. It is not
Western imperialism but the aspirations of Asian peoples
themselves that explain the growing number of democra-
cies and the growing strength of democracy movements
everywhere in Asia. We support those aspirations and
those movements.

Each nation must find its own form of democracy, and we
respect the variety of democratic institutions that have
grown in Asia. But there is no cultural justification for
torture or tyranny. Nor do we accept repression cloaked in
moral relativism. Democracy and human rights are
universal yearnings and universal norms, just as powerful
in Asia as elsewhere. We will continue to press for
improved respect for human rights in such countries as
China, Vietnam and Burma.

The Western Hemisphere

The Western Hemisphere, too, is a fertile field for a
strategy of engagement and enlargement. Sustained
improvements in the security situation there, including the
resolution of border tensions, control of insurgencies and
containment of pressures for arms proliferation, will be an
essential underpinning of political and economic progress
in the hemisphere.

The unprecedented triumph of democracy and market
economies throughout the region offers an unparalleled
opportunity to secure the benefits of peace and stability
and to promote economic growth and trade. At the

41

Summit of the Americas, which President Clinton hosted in
December 1994, the 34 democratic nations of the hemi-
sphere committed themselves for the first time to the goal
of free trade in the region by 2005. They also agreed to a
detailed plan of cooperative action in such diverse fields as
health, education, science and technology, environmental
protection and the strengthening of democratic institutions.
A series of follow-on ministerial meetings have already
begun the important work of implementing an action plan,
with the active participation of the Organization of
American States and the Inter-American Development
Bank. Over the last year Summit partners have worked
together to improve regional security, block the activities of
international criminals, counter corruption and increase
opportunities for health, education and prosperity for resi-
dents of the hemisphere. The Summit ushered in a new era
of hemispheric cooperation that would not have been
possible without U.S. leadership and commitment.

NAFTA, ratified in December 1994, has strengthened
economic ties, with substantial increases in U.S. exports to
both Mexico and Canada, creating new jobs and new
opportunities for American workers and business. We have
also begun negotiations with Chile to join NAFTA. And in
the security sphere, negotiations with Canada will extend
the North American Air Defense (NORAD) Agreement
through 2001.

We remain committed to extending democracy to all of
the region’s people still blocked from controlling their own
destinies. Our overarching objective is to preserve and
defend civilian-elected governments and strengthen demo-
cratic practices respectful of human rights. Working with
the international community, we succeeded in reversing
the coup in Haiti and restoring the democratically elected
president and government. Over the past year, the United
States and the international community have helped the
people of Haiti consolidate their hard-won democracy and
organize free and fair elections at all levels. Haitians were
able to choose their representatives in the Senate, the
Chamber of Deputies and at the local level. And, for the
first time in its history, Haiti experienced a peaceful transi-
tion between two democratically elected presidents.

With the restoration of democracy in Haiti, Cuba is the
only country in the hemisphere still ruled by a dictator.
The Cuban Democracy Act remains the framework for our
policy toward Cuba; our goal is the peaceful establishment
of democratic governance for the people of Cuba. In

42

 

October, the United States took steps to invigorate our
efforts to promote the cause of peaceful change in Cuba.
These measures tighten the enforcement of our economic
embargo against the Cuban regime and enhance our
contacts with the Cuban people through an increase in the
free flow of information and ideas. By reaching out to
nongovernmental organizations, churches, human rights
groups and other elements of Cuba’s civil society, we will
strengthen the agents of peaceful change.

We are working with our neighbors through various hemi-
spheric organizations, including the OAS, to invigorate
regional cooperation. Both bilaterally and regionally, we
seek to eliminate the scourge of drug trafficking, which
poses a serious threat to democracy and security. We also
seek to strengthen norms for defense establishments that
are supportive of democracy, respect for human rights and
civilian control in defense matters. The Defense Ministerial
of the Americas hosted by the United States in July 1995,
and “The Williamsburg Principles” which resulted from it,
were a significant step in this effort. Working with our Latin
American partners who make up the “guarantor countries”,
we also began to move toward a permanent resolution of
the Peru-Ecuador border dispute. In addition, a highly
successful Organization of American States conference on
regional Confidence and Security Building Measures was
held in Santiago, Chile.

Protecting the region’s precious environmental resources is
also an important priority.

The Middle East, Southwest and
South Asia

The United States has enduring interests in the Middle East,
especially in pursuing a lasting and comprehensive Middle
East peace, assuring the security of Israel and our Arab
friends and maintaining the free flow of oil at reasonable
prices. Our strategy is harnessed to the unique characteris-
tics of the region and our vital interests there, as we work
to extend the range of peace and stability.

We have made solid progress in the past three years. The
President's efforts helped bring about many historic firsts —
the handshake of peace between Prime Minister Rabin and
Chairman Arafat on the White House lawn has been
followed by the Jordan-Israel peace treaty, the Israeli-

 

 

Palestinian Interim Agreement, progress on eliminating the
Arab boycott of Israel and the establishment of ties
between Israel and an increasing number of its Arab neigh-
bors. But our efforts have not stopped there; on other bilat-
eral tracks and through regional dialogue we are working
to foster a durable peace and a comprehensive settlement,
while our support for economic development can bring
hope to all the peoples of the region.

In Southwest Asia, the United States remains focused on
deterring threats to regional stability, particularly from Iraq
and Iran as long as those states pose a threat to U.S. inter-
ests, to other states in the region and to their own citizens.
We have in place a dual containment strategy aimed at
these two states and will maintain our long-standing pres-
ence, which has been centered on naval vessels in and
near the Persian Gulf and prepositioned combat equip-
ment. Since Operation Desert Storm, temporary deploy-
ments of land-based aviation forces, ground forces and
amphibious units have supplemented our posture in the
Gulf region. The October 1994 deployment for Operation
Vigilant Warrior demonstrated again our ability to rapidly
reinforce the region in time of crisis and respond quickly to
threats to our allies.

We have made clear that Iraq must comply with all the
relevant Security Council resolutions. We also remain
committed to preventing the oppression of Iraq’s people
through Operations Provide Comfort and Southern Watch.
Our policy is directed not against the people of Iraq but
against the aggressive behavior of the government.

Our policy toward tran is aimed at changing the behavior
of the Iranian government in several key areas, including
Iran’s efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction and
missiles, its support for terrorism and groups that oppose
the peace process, its attempts to undermine friendly
governments in the region and its dismal human rights
record. We remain willing to enter into an authoritative
dialogue with Iran to discuss the differences between us.

A key objective of our policy in the Gulf is to reduce the
chances that another aggressor will emerge who would
threaten the independence of existing states. Therefore, we
will continue to encourage members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) to work closely on collective
defense and security arrangements, help individual GCC
states meet their appropriate defense requirements and
maintain our bilateral defense agreements.

South Asia has experienced an important expansion of

 

democracy and economic reform, and our strategy is
designed to help the peoples of that region enjoy the fruits
of democracy and greater stability through efforts aimed at
resolving long-standing conflict and implementing confi-
dence-building measures. The United States has engaged
India and Pakistan in seeking agreement on steps to cap,
reduce and ultimately eliminate their capabilities for
weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.
Regional stability and improved bilateral ties are also
important for America’s economic interest in a region that
contains a quarter of the world’s population and one of its
most important emerging markets.

In both the Middle East and South Asia, the pressure of
expanding populations on natural resources is enormous.
Growing desertification in the Middle East has strained
relations over arable land. Pollution of the coastal areas in
the Eastern Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Gulf of
Aqaba has degraded fish catches and hindered develop-
ment. Water shortages stemming from overuse, contami-
nated water aquifers and riparian disputes threaten
regional relations. In South Asia, high population densities
and rampant pollution have exacted a tremendous toll on
forests, biodiversity and the local environment.

Africa

Africa poses one of our greatest challenges and opportuni-
ties to enlarge the community of market democracies.
Significant changes have been made in Africa in recent
years: multi-party systems have become more common;
new constitutions have been promulgated; elections have
become more open; the press generally has more freedom
today; and the need for budgetary and financial discipline
is better understood. Throughout Africa, U.S. policies have
supported these developments. Specifically, our policies
have promoted democracy, respect for human rights,
sustainable economic development and resolution of
conflicts through negotiation, diplomacy and peace-
keeping. New policies will strengthen civil societies and
mechanisms for conflict resolution, particularly where
ethnic, religious and political tensions are acute. In partic-
ular, we will seek to identify and address the root causes of
conflicts and disasters before they erupt.

The compounding of economic, political, social, ethnic

and environmental challenges facing Africa can lead to a
sense of ‘Afro-pessimism.’ However, if we can simultane-

43

ously address these challenges, we create a synergy that
can stimulate development, resurrect societies and build
hope. We encourage democratic reform in nations like
Zaire and Sudan to allow the people of these countries to
enjoy responsive government. In Nigeria, we have strongly
condemned the government's brutal human rights viola-
tions and support efforts to help encourage a return to
democratic rule. In Mozambique and Angola, we have
played a leading role in bringing an end to two decades of
civil war and promoting national reconciliation. For the
first time, there is the prospect that all of southern Africa
could enjoy the fruits of peace and prosperity. Throughout
the continent — in Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia, Sudan and
elsewhere — we work with the UN and regional organiza-
tions to encourage peaceful resolution of internal disputes.

In 1994, South Africa held its first non-racial elections and
created a Government of National Unity. Local govern-
ment elections throughout most of the country in
November 1995 marked the near-end of the process of
political transformation. The adoption of a final constitu-
tion now remains.

Vice President Gore recently completed his second trip to
the African continent and to South Africa, where he
conducted the first formal meeting of the U.S.-South Africa
Binational Commission formed during the October 1994
state visit of President Mandela. We remain committed to
addressing the socio-economic legacies of apartheid, and
we view U.S. support for economic advancement and
democratization in South Africa as mutually reinforcing.

It is not just in South Africa that we are witnessing democ-
ratization. In quieter but no less dramatic ways in countries
like Benin, Congo, Malawi, Mali, Namibia and Zambia,
we are seeing democratic revolutions in need of our
support. We want to encourage the creation of cultures of
tolerance, flowering of civil society and the protection of
human rights and dignity.

Our humanitarian interventions, along with the interna-
tional community, will address the grave circumstances in
several nations on the continent. USAID’s new “Greater
Horn of Africa” Initiative is building a foundation for food
security and crisis prevention in the Greater Horn of Africa.
This initiative has now moved beyond relief to support
reconstruction and sustainable development. In Somalia,
our forces broke through the chaos that prevented the
introduction of relief supplies. U.S. forces prevented the

44

 

death of hundreds of thousands of Somalis and then turned
over the mission to UN peacekeepers from over a score of
nations. In Rwanda, Sudan, Angola, Sierra Leone and
Liberia, we have taken an active role in providing humani-
tarian relief to those displaced by violence.

Such efforts by the United States and the international
community must be limited in duration and designed to
give the peoples of a nation the opportunity to put their
own house in order. In the final analysis, the responsibility
for the fate of a nation rests with its own people.

We are also working with international financial institu-
tions, regional organizations, private volunteer and
nongovernmental organizations and governments
throughout Africa to address the urgent issues of popula-
tion growth, spreading disease (including AIDS), environ-
mental decline, enhancing the role of women in develop-
ment, eliminating support for terrorism, demobilization of
bloated militaries, relieving burdensome debt and
expanding trade and investment ties to the countries of
Africa. The United States is working closely with other
donors to implement wide ranging management and
policy reforms at the African Development Bank (AfDB).
The AfDB plays a key role in promoting sustainable devel-
opment and poverty alleviation.

Central to all these efforts will be strengthening the
American constituency for Africa, drawing on the knowl-
edge, experience and commitment of millions of
Americans to enhance our nation’s support for positive
political, economic and social change in Africa. For
example, the 1994 White House Conference on Africa, the
first such gathering of regional experts ever sponsored by
the White House, drew together more than 200 Americans
from the Administration, Congress, business, labor, acad-
emia, religious groups, relief and development agencies,
human rights groups and others to discuss Africa’s future
and the role that the United States can play in it. The
President, Vice President, Secretary of State and National
Security Advisor all participated in the conference, which
produced a wealth of new ideas and new commitment to
Africa.

 

 

IV. Conclusions

The clear and present dangers of the Cold War made the
need for national security commitments and expenditures
obvious to the American people. Today the task of mobi-
lizing public support for national security priorities has
become more complicated. The complex array of new
dangers, opportunities and responsibilities outlined in this
strategy come at a moment in our history when Americans
are preoccupied with domestic concerns and when
budgetary constraints are tighter than at any point in the
last half century. Yet, in a more integrated and interdepen-
dent world, we simply cannot be successful in advancing
our interests — political, military and economic — without
active engagement in world affairs.

Our nation can never again isolate itself from global devel-
opments. Domestic renewal will not succeed if we fail to
engage abroad to open foreign markets, promote democ-
racy in key countries and counter and contain emerging
threats.

 

We are committed to enhancing U.S. national security in
the most efficient and effective ways possible. We recog-
nize that maintaining peace and ensuring our national
security in a volatile world are expensive and require
appropriate resources for all aspects of our engagement —
military, diplomatic and economic. The cost of any other
course of action, however, would be immeasurably higher.

Our engagement abroad requires the active, sustained
bipartisan support of the American people and the U.S.
Congress. Of all the elements contained in this strategy,
none is more important than this: our Administration is
committed to explaining our security interests and objec-

. tives to the nation; to seeking the broadest possible public
and congressional support for our security programs and
investments; and to exerting our leadership in the world in
a manner that reflects our best national values and protects
the security of this great and good nation.

IV. Conclusions

 

 

Preface

Protecting the security of our nation--our people, our territory and our way of life--is my foremost
mission and constitutional duty. As we enter the twenty-first century, we have an unprecedented
opportunity to make our nation safer and more prosperous. Our military might is unparalleled; a
dynamic global economy offers increasing opportunities for American jobs and American investment;
and the community of democratic nations is growing, enhancing the prospects for political stability,
peaceful conflict resolution and greater hope for the people of the world.

At the same time, the dangers we face are unprecedented in their complexity. Ethnic conflict and outlaw
states threaten regional stability; terrorism, drugs, organized crime and proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction are global concerns that transcend national borders; and environmental damage and rapid
population growth undermine economic prosperity and political stability in many countries.

This report, submitted in accordance with Section 603 of the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Department
Reorganization Act of 1986, sets forth a national security strategy to advance our national interests in
this era of unique opportunities and dangers. It is premised on the belief that both our domestic strength
and our leadership abroad are essential to advancing our goal of a safer, more prosperous America.
Building upon America's unmatched strengths, the strategy's three core objectives are:

e To enhance our security with effective diplomacy and with military forces that are ready to fight
and win.

e To bolster America's economic prosperity.

e To promote democracy abroad.

To achieve these objectives, we will remain engaged abroad and work with partners, new and old, to
promote peace and prosperity. We can--and we must--use America's leadership to harness global forces
of integration, reshape existing security, economic and political structures, and build new ones that help
create the conditions necessary for our interests and values to thrive.

As we approach this century's end, the blocs and barriers that divided the world for fifty years largely
have fallen away. Our responsibility is to build the world of tomorrow by embarking on a period of
construction--one based on current realities but enduring American values and interests. In constructing
international frameworks, institutions and understandings to guide America and the world far into the
next century, the following strategic priorities advance our core national security objectives:

First, we must help foster a peaceful, undivided, democratic Europe. When Europe is stable and at peace,
America is more secure. When Europe prospers, so does America.

NATO was created to strengthen Europe's west. Now, it can do the same for Europe's east. This summer,
we will hold a special summit to continue the process of adapting our alliance to new demands while
enlarging it to take in new members from among Europe's new democracies. Countries that were once
our adversaries now can become our allies. We aim to build a strong NATO-Russia partnership that
provides for consultation and, when possible, joint action on common security challenges and
contributes to a democratic Russia's active participation in the post-Cold War European security system.
We will strengthen the Partnership for Peace Program and create an enhanced NATO-Ukraine
relationship.

Second, America must look across the Pacific as well as across the Atlantic. Over the last four years, we
have made significant progress in creating a stable, prosperous Asia Pacific community. In this
endeavor, we must reinforce our close ties to Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia and our ASEAN
friends and allies. As we strengthen our security and promote our prosperity, we must remain alert to the
challenges that remain. We must ensure that North Korea continues to implement its agreement to freeze
and dismantle its nuclear weapons program, and we must fund America's contribution to this effort.
Together with South Korea, we must advance peace talks with North Korea and bridge that armed
divide. And we must sustain the remarkable growth fueled by increasingly open markets and the
integration that all the region's economies are attaining through the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum.

We must pursue a deeper dialogue with China. An isolated, inward-looking China is not good for
America or the world. A China playing its rightful role as a responsible and active member of the
international community is. I will visit China and I have invited China's president to come here not
because we agree on everything, but because engaging China is the best way to work on common
challenges such as ending nuclear testing--and to deal frankly with fundamental differences such as
human rights.

Third, the American people must prosper in the global economy. We have made it our mission to tear
down trade barriers abroad in order to create jobs at home. Over the last four years we have concluded
more than 200 trade agreements, each one of which opened a foreign market more widely to American
products. Today, America is again the world's number one exporter--leading in agriculture and aviation,
automobiles and entertainment, semiconductors and software.

 

 

 

Now, we must build on that momentum, especially in Asia and Latin America. If we fail to act now,
these emerging economies will find their economic future with other nations--and we will be left behind.
That is why I am traveling to Latin America and the Caribbean this year--to continue the work we began
at the Summit of the Americas in Miami in building a community of democracies linked by shared
values and expanding trade. We must continue to help nations embrace open markets, improve living
standards and advance the rule of law and we must support the World Bank and other organizations that
multiply our contributions to progress many times over.

Fourth, America must continue to be an unrelenting force for peace--from the Middle East to Haiti, from
Northern Ireland to Central Africa. Taking reasonable risks for peace keeps us from being drawn into far
more costly conflicts. It encourages other nations to focus on future hopes, not past hatreds. It creates
partners willing to seize the opportunities of a new century. The habits of peace crafted in Bosnia must
take hold, helped by the NATO-led Stabilization Force that is allowing reconstruction and reconciliation
to accelerate.

Fifth, we must continue to move strongly to counter growing dangers to our security: weapons of mass
destruction, terrorism, international crime, drugs, illegal arms trafficking, and environmental damage.
We are acting to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands and to rid the world of
antipersonnel landmines and chemical weapons. The American people are more secure because we won
historic accords to end nuclear testing and to ban chemical weapons. Together with Russia, we are
working to cut our nuclear arsenals by 80 percent from their Cold War height within a decade. We are
working with others, with renewed intensity, to improve civil aviation security, to defeat drug traffickers
and to stop terrorists before they act--and to hold them accountable if they do. We are protecting the
global environment--managing our forests, stopping the spread of toxic chemicals, working to close the
hole in the ozone layer, reducing the greenhouse gasses that challenge our health as they change our
climate.

Finally, we must have the diplomatic and military tools to meet all these challenges. We must maintain a
strong and ready military. We will achieve this by selectively increasing funding for weapons
modernization and taking care of our men and women in uniform. They are doing a remarkable job for
America--America must do right by them.

We must also renew our commitment to America's diplomacy--to ensure that we have the superb
diplomatic representation that our people deserve and our interests demand. Every dollar we devote to
preventing conflicts, promoting democracy, and stopping the spread of disease and starvation brings a
sure return in security and savings. Yet international affairs spending today totals just one percent of the
federal budget--a small fraction of what America invested at the start of the Cold War when we chose
engagement over isolation. If America is to continue to lead the world by its own example, we must
demonstrate our own commitment to these priority tasks. This is also why we must pay our debts and
dues to a reforming United Nations.

Inherent in this final priority is the need to examine our overall national security posture, programs,
structure and budget. Within the Department of Defense such a review is currently underway and the
State Department and other international affairs agencies are reorganizing to confront the pressing
challenges of tomorrow. We need to continue looking across our government to see if during this time of
transition we are adequately preparing to meet the national security challenges of the next century.

Each of these six priorities is essential to keeping America strong, secure and prosperous and to
advancing our national security objectives. Our strategy requires the patient application of American will
and resources. We can sustain that necessary investment only with the continued support of the
American people and the bipartisan support of their representatives in Congress--a bipartisanship that
was clearly displayed in the recent ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The full
participation of Congress is essential to the success of our continuing engagement, and I will consult
with members of Congress at every step as we formulate and implement American foreign policy.

America has an unparalleled record of international leadership. Through our leadership comes rewards.

 

The more America leads, the more willing others are to share the risks and responsibilities of forging our
futures. We have repeatedly seen this over the last four years--in Bosnia and Haiti where we worked
with many other nations for peace and democracy, in the Summit of the Americas and APEC Leaders
Forum where we agreed with our partners to build a free and open trading system, and in many other
instances. Our achievements of the last four years are the springboard for tomorrow's better world.

We are at the dawn of a new century. Now is the moment to be farsighted as we chart a path into the
new millennium. As borders open and the flow of information, technology, money, trade, and people
across borders increases, the line between domestic and foreign policy continues to blur. We can only
preserve our security and well being at home by being actively involved in the world beyond our
borders.

The need for American leadership abroad remains as strong as ever. With the support of the American
public, I am committed to sustaining our active engagement abroad in pursuit of our cherished goal--a
more secure and prosperous America in a more peaceful and prosperous world where democracy and
free markets know no limits.

 

I. Leadership Today For a Safer,
More Prosperous Tomorrow

Our national security strategy must always be judged by its success in meeting the fundamental purposes
set out in the Constitution:

...provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of
Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,...

Since the founding of the nation, certain requirements have remained constant. We must protect the lives
and personal safety of Americans, both at home and abroad. We must maintain the sovereignty, political
freedom and independence of the United States, with its values, institutions and territory intact. And, we
must provide for the well-being and prosperity of the nation and its people.

Challenges and Opportunities

The security environment in which we live is dynamic and uncertain, replete with numerous challenges.
Ethnic conflict and outlaw states threaten stability in many regions of the world. Weapons of mass
destruction, terrorism, organized crime and environmental damage are global concerns that transcend
national borders. Yet, this is also a period of great promise. America's core values of representative
governance, market economics and respect for fundamental human rights have been embraced by many
nations around the world, creating new opportunities to promote peace, prosperity and greater
cooperation among nations. Former adversaries now cooperate with us. The dynamism of the global
economy is transforming commerce, culture, communications and global relations.

During the first Clinton Administration we assessed America’s role in a radically transformed security
environment and outlined a national security strategy to advance our interests. Our strategy highlighted
that the demise of communism in the former Soviet Union brought with it unprecedented opportunities
in global relations as well as a host of threats and challenges with the potential to grow more deadly in a
world grown closer. This strategy took into account the revolution in technology that not only enriches
our lives, but makes it possible for terrorists, criminals and drug traffickers to challenge the safety of our
citizens and the security of our borders in new ways. Our strategy focused on the security implications
for both present and long-term American policy raised by transnational problems that once seemed quite
distant--such as resource depletion, rapid population growth, environmental degradation and refugee
migration. Faced with these circumstances, we did not set objectives for separate and distinct foreign
and domestic policies, but rather for economic and security policies that advance our interests and ideals
in a world where the dividing line between domestic and foreign policy is increasingly blurred.

 

 

These principles continue to guide us at the beginning of the second Clinton Administration and prompt
us to make some general observations about America's role in the world in which we live.

Because we are a nation with global interests, we face a variety of challenges to our interests, often far
beyond our shores. We must always retain our superior diplomatic, technological, industrial and military
capabilities to address this broad range of challenges so that we can respond together with other nations
when we can, and alone when we must. We have seen in the past that the international community is
often reluctant to act forcefully without American leadership. In many instances, the United States is the
only nation capable of providing the necessary leadership for an international response to shared
challenges.

The Imperative of Engagement

These observations make our strategic approach clear. First, we must be prepared and willing to use all
appropriate instruments of national power to influence the actions of other states and non-state actors.
Second, we must have the demonstrated will and capabilities to continue to exert global leadership and
remain the preferred security partner for the community of states that share our interests. In short,
American leadership and engagement in the world are vital for our security, and the world is a safer
place as a result. :

Three-quarters of a century ago, the United States squandered Allied victory in World War I when it
embraced isolationism and turned inward. After World War II, and in the face of a new totalitarian
threat, America accepted the challenge to lead. We remained engaged overseas and, with our allies,
worked to create international structures--from the Marshall Plan, the United Nations, NATO and 42
other defense arrangements, to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank that enabled us to
strengthen our security and prosperity and win the Cold War.

By exerting our leadership abroad, we can make America safer and more prosperous--by deterring
aggression, fostering the resolution of conflicts, opening foreign markets, strengthening democracies,
and tackling global problems. Without our leadership and engagement, threats would multiply and our
opportunities would narrow. Our strategy recognizes a simple truth: we must lead abroad if we are to be
secure at home, but we cannot lead abroad unless we are strong at home.

Underpinning that international leadership is the power of our democratic ideals and values. In designing
our strategy, we recognize that the spread of democracy supports American values and enhances both
our security and prosperity. Democratic governments are more likely to cooperate with each other
against common threats and to encourage free and open trade and economic development--and less
likely to wage war or abuse the rights of their people. Hence, the trend toward democracy and free
markets throughout the world advances American interests. The United States must support this trend by
remaining actively engaged in the world. This is the strategy to take us into the next century.

Implementing the Strategy

Though we must always be prepared to act alone, when necessary, or as a leader of an ad hoc coalition
that may form around a specific objective, we cannot always accomplish our foreign policy goals
unilaterally. An important element of our security preparedness depends on durable relationships with
allies and other friendly nations. Accordingly, a central thrust of our strategy is to strengthen and adapt
the security relationships we have with key nations around the world and create new structures when
necessary. Examples of these efforts include NATO enlargement, the Partnership for Peace, and the
commitment by the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Summit of the Americas
to expand free trade and investment.

At other times we must harness our diplomatic, military and economic strengths to shape a favorable
international environment outside of any formal structures. This approach has borne fruit in areas as
diverse as the advancement of peace in the Middle East and Northern Ireland, the elimination of nuclear

 

 

weapons from Ukraine, Kazakstan and Belarus and in our support for the transformation of South
Africa, and is further exemplified through our comprehensive assistance package to Russia and other
New Independent States (NIS).

In implementing our strategy for a safer, more prosperous tomorrow, we are guided by the strategic
priorities President Clinton laid out in his 1997 State of the Union Address:

e foster an undivided, democratic and peaceful Europe

e forge a strong and stable Asia Pacific community

© continue America's leadership as the world's most important force for peace

create more jobs and opportunities for Americans through a more open and competitive trading
system that also benefits others around the world

e increase cooperation in confronting new security threats that defy borders and unilateral solutions

strengthen the military and diplomatic tools necessary to meet these challenges

As we stand at the edge of a new century, our national security strategy will continue to make a real
difference in the lives of our citizens by promoting a world of open societies and open markets that is
supportive of U.S. interests and consistent with American values. We know that there must be limits to
America's involvement in the world. We must be selective in the use of our capabilities, and the choices
we make always must be guided by advancing our objectives of a more secure, prosperous and free
America. But we also recognize that if we withdraw U.S. leadership from the world today, we will have
to contend with the consequences of our neglect tomorrow. America cannot walk away from its global
interests and responsibilities, or our citizens’ security and prosperity will surely suffer.

We also know that our engagement abroad rightly depends on the willingness of the American people
and the Congress to bear the costs of defending U.S. interests in dollars, energy, and, when there is no
other alternative, American lives. We must, therefore, foster the broad public understanding and
bipartisan congressional support necessary to sustain our international engagement, always recognizing
that some decisions that face popular opposition must ultimately be judged by whether they advance the
interests of the American people in the long run.

 

If. Advancing U.S. National Interests

As stated, the goal of the national security strategy is to ensure the protection of our nation's
fundamental and enduring needs: protect the lives and safety of Americans; maintain the sovereignty of
the United States, with its values, institutions and territory intact; and provide for the prosperity of the
nation and its people.

We seek to create conditions in the world where our interests are rarely threatened, and when they are,
we have effective means of addressing those threats. In general, we seek a world in which no critical
region is dominated by a power hostile to the United States and regions of greatest importance to the
U.S. are stable and at peace. We seek a climate where the global economy and open trade are growing,
where democratic norms and respect for human rights are increasingly accepted and where terrorism,
drug trafficking and international crime do not undermine stability and peaceful relations. And we seek a
world where the spread of nuclear, chemical, biological and other potentially destabilizing technologies
is minimized, and the international community is willing and able to prevent or respond to calamitous
events. This vision of the world is also one in which the United States has close cooperative relations
with the world's most influential countries and has the ability to influence the policies and actions of
those who can affect our national well-being.

The overall health of the international economic environment directly affects our security, just as
stability enhances the prospects for prosperity. This prosperity, a goal in itself, also ensures that we are
able to sustain our military forces, foreign initiatives and global influence. It is that engagement and
influence that helps ensure the world remains stable so that the international economic system can

 

 

flourish.

We believe that our strategy will move us closer to the vision outlined above and therefore will achieve
our objectives of enhancing our security, bolstering our economic prosperity and promoting democracy.

_ Enhancing Security

To ensure the safety of our nation, the United States will continue its integrated approach to addressing
the numerous threats to our interests and preserve a full range of foreign policy tools. We must maintain
superior military forces. Similarly, we must retain a strong diplomatic corps and a foreign assistance
program sufficient to maintain American leadership. Our tools of foreign policy must be able to shape
the international environment, respond to the full spectrum of potential crises and prepare against future
threats. Our military forces will have the ability to respond to challenges short of war, and in concert
with regional friends and allies, to win two overlapping major theater wars. We will continue pursuing
diplomatic, economic, military, arms control, and nonproliferation efforts that promote stability and
reduce the danger of nuclear, chemical, biological and conventional conflict.

Threats to U.S. Interests

The current era presents a diverse set of threats to our enduring goals and hence to our security. These
threats are generally grouped into three, often intertwined, categories:

e Regional or State-centered Threats: A number of states still have the capabilities and the desire
to threaten our vital interests, through either coercion or cross border aggression. In many cases,
these states are also actively improving their offensive capabilities, including efforts to obtain
nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. In other cases, unstable nations, internal conflicts or
failed states may threaten to further destabilize regions where we have clear interests.

Transnational Threats: Some threats transcend national borders. These transnational threats,
such as terrorism, the illegal drug trade, illicit arms trafficking, international organized crime,
uncontrolled refugee migrations, and environmental damage threaten American interests and
citizens, both directly and indirectly. Not all of these are new threats, but advances in technology
have, in some cases, made these threats more potent.

Threats from Weapons of Mass Destruction: Weapons of mass destruction pose the greatest
potential threat to global security. We must continue to reduce the threat posed by existing
arsenals of such weaponry as well as work to stop the proliferation of advanced technologies that
place these destructive capabilities in the hands of parties hostile to U.S. and global security
interests. Danger exists from outlaw states opposed to regional and global security efforts and
transnational actors, such as terrorists or international crime organizations, potentially employing
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against unprotected peoples and governments.

The Need for Integrated Approaches

No one nation can defeat these threats alone. Accordingly, a central thrust of our strategy is to adapt our
security relationships with key nations around the world to combat these threats to common interests.
We seek to strengthen cooperation with friends and allies to address these threats by, for example,
denying terrorists safe havens, cracking down on money laundering and tightening intelligence
cooperation to prevent weapons proliferation, terrorist attacks and international crime.

Building effective coalitions of like-minded nations is not enough. That is why we are continuing to
strengthen our own capabilities: so we can more effectively lead the international community in
responding to these threats, and act on our own when we must. Our response to these threats is not
limited exclusively to any one agency within the U.S. Government. National security preparedness
particularly in this era when domestic and foreign policies are increasingly blurred crosses agency lines;
thus, our approach places a premium on integrated interagency efforts to enhance U.S. security.

 

Many aspects of our strategy are focused on shaping the international environment to prevent or deter
threats. Diplomacy, international assistance, arms contro! programs, nonproliferation initiatives, and
overseas military presence are examples of shaping activities. A second element of this integrated
approach is the requirement to maintain an ability to respond across the full spectrum of potential crises,
up to and including fighting and winning major theater wars. Finally, we must prepare today to meet the
challenges of tomorrow's uncertain future.

Shaping the International Environment

The United States has a range of tools at its disposal with which to shape the international environment
in ways favorable to U.S. interests and global security. Shaping activities enhance U.S. security by
promoting regional security and preventing and reducing the wide range of diverse threats outlined
above. These measures adapt and strengthen alliances, maintain U.S. influence in key regions and
encourage adherence to international norms. When signs of potential conflict emerge, or potential threats
appear, we undertake initiatives to prevent or reduce these threats. Such efforts might aim to discourage
arms races, halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and reduce tensions in critical regions.
Shaping activities take many forms.

through Diplomacy

Diplomacy is our first line of defense against threats to national and international security. The daily
business of diplomacy conducted through our missions and representatives around the world is a vital
shaping activity. These efforts are essential to sustaining our alliances, forcefully articulating U.S.
interests, resolving regional disputes peacefully, averting humanitarian catastrophe, deterring aggression
against the United States and our friends and allies, creating trade and investment opportunities for U.S.
companies, and projecting U.S. influence worldwide.

One of the lessons that has been repeatedly driven home is the importance--and cost effectiveness--of
preventive diplomacy in dealing with conflict and complex emergencies. It is far more effective to help
prevent nations from failing than to rebuild them after an internal crisis; far more beneficial to help
people stay in their homes than it is to feed and house them in refugee camps; and far less taxing for
relief agencies and international organizations to strengthen the institutions of conflict resolution than to
heal ethnic and social divisions that have already exploded into bloodshed. In short, while crisis
management and crisis resolution are necessary tasks for our foreign policy, preventive diplomacy is
obviously far preferable.

Military force and the credible possibility of its use are essential to defend our vital interests and keep
America safe. But force alone can be a blunt instrument, and there are many problems it cannot solve.
To be most effective, force and diplomacy must complement and reinforce each other for there will be
many occasions and many places where we must rely on diplomatic shaping activities to protect and
advance our interests.

.through International Assistance

From the U.S.-led mobilization to rebuild post-war Europe to the more recent creation of export
opportunities across Asia, Latin America and Africa, U.S. foreign assistance has helped expand free
markets, assisted emerging democracies, contained environmental hazards and major health threats,
slowed population growth and defused humanitarian crises. Crises are averted--and U.S. preventive
diplomacy actively reinforced--through U.S. sustainable development programs that promote voluntary
family planning, basic education, environmental protection, democratic governance and rule of law, and
the economic empowerment of private citizens.

When combined effectively with other bilateral and multilateral activities, U.S. initiatives reduce the
need for costly military and humanitarian interventions. Where foreign aid succeeds in consolidating
free market policies, substantial growth of American exports has frequently followed. Where crises have
occurred, actions such as the Greater Horn of Africa Initiative have helped staunch mass human
suffering and created a path out of conflict and dislocation through targeted relief. Other foreign aid
programs have worked to help restore elementary security and civic institutions.

 

 

 

..through Arms Control

Arms control efforts are another important shaping tool. By increasing transparency surrounding the size
and structure of military forces, arms control efforts build national confidence, reduce incentives to
initiate an attack and allow countries to direct resources to safer, more productive relations. Our various
arms control initiatives are an essential prevention measure that can yield disproportionately significant
results, often eliminating the need for a more substantial U.S. response later.

Reductions in strategic offensive arms and the steady shift toward less destabilizing systems remain
essential to our strategy. Under START II, the United States and Russia will each be limited to no more
than 3,000-3,500 total deployed strategic nuclear warheads. START II ratification by Russia will open
the door to the next round of strategic arms control.

At the Helsinki Summit, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to START III guidelines that if adopted
will, by the end of 2007, cap the number of strategic nuclear warheads deployed in each country at
2,000-2,500--reducing both our arsenals by 80 percent from Cold War heights. They agreed that START
III will, for the first time, require the U.S. and Russia to destroy nuclear warheads, not only the missiles,
aircraft and submarines that carry them, and they opened the door to possible reductions in shorter-range
nuclear weapons. Also at Helsinki, the Presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty and the necessity of effective theater missile defenses and reached agreement on
demarcation between systems to counter strategic and theater ballistic missiles.

Regional and multilateral arms control efforts, such as achieving a comprehensive global ban on
antipersonnel landmines as soon as possible, strengthening the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention
(BWC) and implementing and enforcing the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) increase the
security of our citizens and prevent or limit conflict. That is why the Administration aggressively
pursued Senate ratification of the CWC. Similarly, Senate approval of the CFE Flank Agreement is
important because the agreement underpins new negotiations to adapt the 30-nation CFE Treaty to the
changing European security environment. And, Senate approval of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT) banning all nuclear test explosions is also a priority objective.

Other arms control objectives include securing Indian and Pakistani accession to the CTBT to allow that
treaty to enter into force; obtaining Senate approval of protocols to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone
Treaty and the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty, and protocols to the Convention on
Conventional Weapons dealing with landmines and blinding lasers; and obtaining Russian, Ukrainian
and Belarusian ratification of the Open Skies Treaty.

We also promote, through international organizations such as the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), implementation of confidence and security-building measures in regions
of tension and instability--even where we are not formal parties to such agreements. Agreements in the
Balkans as mandated by the Dayton Accords are excellent examples.

..through Nonproliferation Initiatives

Nonproliferation initiatives, which deter the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) nuclear,
biological and chemical and stem their spread and that of their component parts or delivery systems,
enhance global security. The Administration supports international treaty regimes that prohibit the
acquisition of weapons of mass destruction, including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the
CWC and the BWC. We also seek to achieve a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty to cap the nuclear
materials available for weapons purposes.

The Administration also seeks to limit access to sensitive equipment and technologies through
participating in and fostering the efforts of multilateral regimes, including the Wassenaar Arrangement
on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies, the Australia Group
(for chemical and biological weapons), the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), and the
Nuclear Suppliers Group. We are working to harmonize national export control policies, increase
information sharing, refine control lists and expand cooperation against illicit transfers.

Regional nonproliferation efforts are particularly critical in three proliferation zones: the Korean

 

 

Peninsula, where the 1994 Agreed Framework requires North Korea's full compliance with its
nonproliferation obligations; the Middle East and Southwest Asia, where we encourage regional arms
control agreements that address legitimate security concerns of all parties and continue efforts to thwart
and roll back Iran's development of weapons of mass destruction and Iraq's efforts to reconstitute its
programs; and South Asia, where we seek to persuade India and Pakistan to bring their nuclear and
missile programs into conformity with international nonproliferation standards.

Through programs, such as the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and other initiatives,
we aim to prevent the theft or diversion of WMD or related material or technology. We are purchasing
tons of highly enriched uranium from dismantled Russian nuclear weapons for conversion into
commercial reactor fuel for U.S. use. And we are also working together to redirect former Soviet
facilities and scientists from military to peaceful purposes.

We are working with China to resolve a number of important proliferation issues and they have
committed not to transfer MTCR-controlled missiles. Our priority now is to gain their agreement to
implement national export controls that meet international standards.

through Military Activities

The U.S. military plays an essential role in building coalitions and shaping the international environment
in ways that protect and promote U.S. interests. Through means such as the forward stationing or
deployment of forces, defense cooperation and security assistance, and training and exercises with allies
and friends, our armed forces help to promote regional stability, deter aggression and coercion, prevent
and reduce conflicts and threats, and serve as role models for militaries in emerging democracies.

Our military promotes regional stability in numerous ways. In Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia,
where the U.S. has clear, vital interests, the American military helps assure the security of key allies and
friends. We are continuing to adapt and strengthen our alliances and coalitions to meet the challenges of
an evolving security environment and to improve other countries' peacekeeping capabilities. With
countries that are neither staunch friends nor known foes, military cooperation often serves as a positive
means of engagement, building security relationships today in an effort to keep these countries from
becoming adversaries tomorrow.

Deterrence of aggression and coercion on a daily basis is another crucial aspect of the military's shaping
role. Our ability to deter potential adversaries in peacetime rests on several factors, particularly on our
demonstrated will and ability to uphold our security commitments when they are challenged. We have
earned this reputation through both our declaratory policy, which clearly communicates costs to
potential adversaries, and the credibility of our conventional warfighting capability, as embodied in
forces and equipment strategically stationed or deployed forward, our rapidly deployable stateside-based
forces, our ability to gain timely access to critical infrastructure overseas, and our demonstrated ability
to form and lead effective military coalitions.

U.S. military forces prevent and reduce a wide range of potential conflicts in key regions. An example of
such an activity is our deployment to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to prevent the spread
of violence to that country.

Our armed forces also serve as a role model for militaries in emerging democracies around the world.
Through modest military-to-military activities and increasing links between the U.S. military and the
military establishments of Partnership for Peace nations, for instance, we are helping to transform
military institutions in central and eastern Europe.

Finally, our nuclear deterrent posture is one of the most visible and important examples of how U.S.
military capabilities can be used effectively to deter aggression and coercion. Nuclear weapons serve as
a hedge against an uncertain future, a guarantee of our security commitments to allies and a disincentive
to those who would contemplate developing or otherwise acquiring their own nuclear weapons. In this
context, the United States must continue to maintain a robust triad of strategic forces sufficient to deter
any hostile foreign leadership with access to nuclear forces and to convince it that seeking a nuclear
advantage would be futile.

 

 

 

 

Responding to Crises

Because our shaping efforts alone cannot guarantee the international environment we seek, the United
States must be able to respond to the full spectrum of crises that may arise. Our resources are finite,
however, so we must be selective in our responses, focusing on challenges that most directly affect our
interests and engaging where we can make the most difference. Our response might be diplomatic,
economic, law enforcement, or military in nature--or, more likely, some combination of the above. We
must use the most appropriate tool or combination of tools--acting in alliance or partnership when our
interests are shared by others, but unilaterally when compelling national interests so demand.

Since there are always many demands for U.S. action, our national interests must be clear. These
interests fall into three categories. The first includes vital interests those of broad, overriding importance
to the survival, safety and vitality of our nation. Among these are the physical security of our territory
and that of our allies, the safety of our citizens, and our economic well-being. We will do whatever it
takes to defend these interests, including--when necessary--using our military might unilaterally and
decisively.

The second category includes situations where important national interests are at stake. These interests
do not affect our national survival, but they do affect our national well-being and the character of the
world in which we live. In such cases, we will use our resources to advance these interests insofar as the
costs and risks are commensurate with the interests at stake. Our intervention in Haiti and participation
in NATO operations in Bosnia are relevant examples.

The third category involves humanitarian interests. In the event of natural or manmade disasters or gross
violations of human rights, our nation may act because our values demand it. Moreover, in such cases,
the force of our example bolsters support for our leadership in the world. Whenever possible, we seek to
avert such humanitarian disasters through diplomacy and cooperation with a wide range of partners,
including other governments, international institutions and nongovernmental organizations. By doing so,
we may not only save lives but also prevent the drain on resources caused by intervention in a full-blown
crisis.

The U.S. military is at once dangerous to our enemies and a bulwark to our friends. Though typically not
the best tool to address long-term humanitarian concerns, under certain circumstances our military may
provide appropriate and necessary humanitarian assistance. Those circumstances include: a natural or
manmade disaster that dwarfs the ability of the normal relief agencies to respond; the need for relief is
urgent and the military has a unique ability to respond quickly; and the U.S. mission is narrowly defined
with minimal risk to American lives. In these cases, the United States may intervene when the costs and
risks are commensurate with the stakes involved and when there is reason to believe that our action can
make a real difference. Such efforts by the United States and the international community will be limited
in duration and designed to give the affected country the opportunity to put its house in order. In the
final analysis, the responsibility for the fate of a nation rests with its own people.

One final consideration regards the central role the American people rightfully play in how the United
States wields its power abroad: the United States cannot long sustain a commitment without the support
of the public, and close consultations with Congress are important in this effort. When it is judged in
America's interest to intervene, we must remain clear in purpose and resolute in execution.

Transnational Threats

Today, American diplomats, law enforcement officials, military personnel and others are called upon to
respond to assorted transnational threats that have moved to center stage with the Cold War's end.
Combating these dangers which range from terrorism, international crime, and trafficking in drugs and
illegal arms, to environmental damage and intrusions in our critical information infrastructures requires
far-reaching cooperation among the agencies of our government as well as with other nations.

The United States will continue appropriate sharing of intelligence and information with other nations to

 

 

counter terrorism, corruption and money-laundering activities, and fight drug trafficking. We will also
further seek to prevent arms traders from fueling regional conflicts and subverting international
embargoes and will impose additional sanctions on states that sponsor terrorism. International
cooperation to combat these transnational threats will be vital for building security in the next century.

Terrorism

U.S. counterterrorism approaches are meant to prevent, disrupt and defeat terrorist operations before
they occur, and, if terrorist acts do occur, to respond overwhelmingly, with determined efforts to bring
the perpetrators to justice. Our policy to counter international terrorists rests on the following principles:
(1) make no concessions to terrorists; (2) bring all pressure to bear on state sponsors of terrorism; (3)
fully exploit all available legal mechanisms to punish international terrorists; and (4) help other
governments improve their capabilities to combat terrorism.

The U.S. has made concerted efforts to deter and punish terrorists and remains determined to apprehend
those who terrorize American citizens. Similarly, as long as terrorists continue to target American
citizens and interests, we reserve the right to strike at their bases and attack assets valued by those who
support them--a right we exercised in 1993 with the attack against Iraqi intelligence headquarters in
response to Baghdad's assassination attempt against former President Bush.

Countering terrorism effectively requires day-to-day coordination within the U.S. Government and close
cooperation with other governments and international organizations. We have seen positive results from
the increasing integration of intelligence, diplomatic, investigative and prosecutorial activities among the
Departments of State, Justice, Defense, Treasury, Transportation, and the CIA. The Administration is
also working with Congress to increase the ability of these agencies to combat terrorism through
augmented funding and manpower.

Placing terrorism at the top of the diplomatic agenda has increased international information sharing and
law enforcement efforts. At the 1996 Lyon Summit the industrial powers joined in condemning Iran's
support for terrorism and continued efforts to achieve global adoption of all current counterterrorism
treaties by the year 2000. Last year Congress and the President worked together to enact the Iran-Libya
Sanctions Act which will increase economic pressure on these two state sponsors of terrorism. We
further seek to uncover, reduce or eliminate foreign terrorist capabilities in our country; eliminate
terrorist sanctuaries; counter state-supported terrorism and subversion of moderate regimes through a
comprehensive program of diplomatic, economic and intelligence activities; improve aviation security
worldwide and at U.S. airports; ensure better security for all U.S. transportation systems; and improve
protection for our personnel assigned overseas.

Drug Trafficking

The U.S. response to the global scourge of drug abuse and drug trafficking is to integrate domestic and
international efforts to reduce both the demand and the supply of drugs. Its ultimate success will depend
on concerted efforts by the public, all levels of government and the private sector together with other
governments, private groups and international organizations. Domestically, we seek to educate and
enable America's youth to reject illegal drugs; increase the safety of America's citizens by substantially
reducing drug-related crime and violence; reduce health and social costs to the public of illegal drug use;
and shield America's air, land and sea frontiers from the drug threat.

Abroad, the U.S. National Drug Control Strategy seeks to reduce cultivation of drug producing crops,
interdict the flow of drugs at the source and in the transit zone (particularly in Central and South
America, the Caribbean and Mexico), and stop drugs from entering our country. The strategy includes
efforts to strengthen democratic institutions; root out corruption; destroy trafficking organizations;
prevent money laundering; eradicate illegal drug crops in this hemisphere, Asia and the Middle East; and
encourage alternate crop development. The United States is aggressively engaging international
organizations, financial institutions and non-governmental organizations in counternarcotics
cooperation. For instance, the President has invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
(IEEPA) to attack the finances, companies and individuals owned or controlled by the Cali Cartel as
well as other Colombian drug cartels, freezing their assets in the United States, identifying front
companies and barring Americans from doing business with them.

 

 

 

Our strategy recognizes that at home and abroad, prevention, treatment and economic alternatives must
go hand-in-hand with law enforcement and interdiction. Long-term efforts will be maintained to help
nations develop economies with fewer market incentives for producing drugs. We have also increased
efforts abroad to foster public awareness and support for foreign governments' efforts to reduce drug
abuse.

International Organized Crime

International organized crime undermines fragile new democracies as well as developing nations and
challenges our own security. In parts of the former Soviet Union, for instance, organized crime poses a
threat to our interests because of the potential for theft and smuggling of inherited nuclear materials
remaining in those countries.

To fight organized crime, we seek to mount an international effort to combat the major international
criminal cartels, most notably those based in Italy, the former Soviet Union, Colombia, Southeast Asia,
and Nigeria. In particular, in the context of the P-8 and bilaterally, we are promoting legal assistance and
extradition cooperation. We also are working to combat money laundering and other criminal activities
in the major offshore financial centers, create indigenous criminal investigation and prosecution
capabilities in key countries and implement specific plans to address several other financial crimes,
including counterfeiting, large-scale international fraud and embezzlement, computer intrusion of banks
and cellular phones, and alien smuggling.

The Administration has launched a major initiative to stop criminal organizations from moving funds
through the international financial system. We will identify and put on notice nations that fail to bring
their financial systems into conformity with international standards and appropriate Financial Action
Task Force (FATF) recommendations. We also seek to target the criminal enterprises that are developing
the gray market trade in illegal weapons. By using forged documents and diverting deliveries of
armaments, these networks serve criminals and terrorists alike and move weapons to areas of conflict
and instability, often subverting international arms embargoes.

International organized crime organizations target nations whose law enforcement agencies lack the
capacity and experience to stop them. To help the new democracies of Central Europe, the United States
and Hungary established an international law enforcement academy in Budapest. The President proposed
last year at the United Nations to establish a network of such centers around the world to share the latest
crime-fighting techniques and technology.

Environmental and Security Concerns

Environmental threats do not heed national borders and can pose long-term dangers to our security and
well-being. Natural resource scarcities often trigger and exacerbate conflict. Environmental threats such
as climate change, ozone depletion and the transnational movement of dangerous chemicals directly
threaten the health of U.S. citizens. We must work closely with other countries to respond aggressively
to these and other environmental threats. <

Decisions today regarding the environment and natural resources can affect our security for generations;
consequently, our national security planning is incorporating environmental analyses as never before. In
addition, we have a full diplomatic agenda, working unilaterally, regionally and multilaterally to forge
agreements to protect the global environment.

Smaller-Scale Contingencies

When efforts to deter an adversary occur in the context of a crisis, they become the leading edge of crisis
response. In this sense, deterrence straddles the line between shaping the international environment and
responding to crises. Deterrence in crisis generally involves signaling the United States' commitment to
a particular country or interest by enhancing our warfighting capability in the theater. Forces in or near
the theater may be moved closer to the crisis and other forces rapidly deployed to the area. The U.S. may
also choose to make additional declaratory statements to communicate the costs of aggression or
coercion to an adversary, and in some cases may choose to employ U.S. forces in a limited manner to

underline the message and deter further adventurism.

The U.S. military conducts smaller-scale contingency operations to vindicate national interests. These
operations encompass the full range of military operations short of major theater warfare, including
humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping, disaster relief, no-fly zones, reinforcing key allies, limited
strikes, and interventions. These operations will likely pose the most frequent challenge for U.S. forces
and cumulatively require significant commitments over time. These operations will also put a premium
on the ability of the U.S. military to work closely and effectively with other U.S. Government agencies,
nongovernmental organizations, regional and international security organizations and coalition partners.

Not only must the U.S. military be prepared to successfully conduct multiple concurrent operations
worldwide, it must also be prepared to do so in the face of challenges such as terrorism, information
operations, and the threat or use of weapons of mass destruction. U.S. forces must also remain prepared
to withdraw from contingency operations if needed to deploy to a major theater war. Accordingly, U.S.
forces will remain multi-mission capable and will be trained and managed with multiple missions in
mind.

At times it will be in our national interest to proceed in partnership with others to preserve, maintain and
restore peace. American participation in peace operations takes many forms, such as the NATO coalition
in Bosnia, the American-led UN force in Haiti and our involvement in a multilateral coalition in the
Sinai.

The question of command and control in contingency operations is particularly critical. Under no
circumstances will the President ever relinquish his constitutionally mandated command authority over
USS. forces, but there may be times when it is in our interest to place U.S. forces under the temporary
operational control of a competent allied or United Nations commander. This is consistent with
well-established practice from the siege of Yorktown during the Revolutionary War to the battles of
Operation DESERT STORM.

Major Theater Warfare

At the high end of responding to crises is fighting and winning major theater wars. This mission will
remain the ultimate test of our Total Force our active and reserve military components and one in which
it must always succeed. For the foreseeable future, the United States, in concert with regional allies,
must remain able to deter credibly and defeat large-scale, cross-border aggression in two distant theaters
in overlapping time frames.

As long as countries like Iraq and North Korea remain capable of threatening vital U.S. interests, this
requirement is only prudent. Maintaining such a capability should, when we are heavily engaged in one
region, deter opportunism elsewhere and provide a hedge against the possibility that we might encounter
larger or more difficult than expected threats. A strategy for deterring and defeating aggression in two
theaters ensures we maintain the flexibility to meet unknown future threats, while continued global
engagement helps preclude such threats from developing.

Fighting and winning major theater wars entails three particularly challenging requirements. First, we
must maintain the ability to rapidly defeat initial enemy advances short of enemy objectives in two
theaters, in close succession. The U.S. must maintain this ability to ensure that we can seize the
initiative, minimize territory lost before an invasion is halted, and ensure the integrity of our warfighting
coalitions.

Second, the United States must plan and prepare to fight and win under conditions where an adversary
may use asymmetric means against us unconventional approaches that avoid or undermine our strengths
while exploiting our vulnerabilities. This is of particular importance and a significant challenge. Because
of our dominance in the conventional military arena, adversaries who challenge the United States are
likely to do so using asymmetric means, such as WMD, information operations or terrorism.

Finally, our military must also be able to transition to fighting major theater wars from a posture of

 

 

 

global engagement from substantial levels of peacetime engagement overseas as well as multiple
concurrent smaller-scale contingencies. Withdrawing from such operations would post significant
political and operational challenges. Ultimately, however, the United States must accept a degree of risk
associated with withdrawing from contingency operations and engagement activities in order to reduce
the greater risk incurred if we failed to respond adequately to major theater wars.

Our priority is to shape effectively the international environment so as to deter the onset of major theater
wars. Should deterrence fail, however, the United States will defend itself, its allies and partners with all
means necessary.

Preparing Now for an Uncertain Future

At the same time we address the problems of today, we must prepare now for tomorrow's uncertain
future. This requires that we support shaping and responding requirements in the near term, while at the
same time evolving our unparalleled capabilities to ensure we can effectively shape and respond to meet
future challenges. Key to this evolution is the need to foster innovation in new operational concepts,
capabilities, technologies and organizational structures; modernize our forces; and take prudent steps
today to position ourselves to respond more effectively to unlikely but significant future threats.

We must continue aggressive efforts to construct appropriate twenty-first century national security
programs and structures. The Quadrennial Defense Review is doing this within the Department of
Defense, and the State Department and other international affairs agencies are similarly reorganizing to
confront the pressing challenges of tomorrow as well as those we face today. We need to continue
looking across our government to see if during this time of transition we are adequately preparing to
meet the national security challenges of the next century.

It is critical that we renew our commitment to America's diplomacy-- to ensure we have the diplomatic
representation required to support our global interests. This is central to retaining our ability to remain
an influential voice on international issues that affect our well-being. We will preserve that influence so
long as we retain the diplomatic capabilities, military wherewithal and economic base to underwrite our
commitments credibly.

The United States is approaching the point where a major modernization of our military forces is
required. The military procurement buys of the late-70s and early-80s permitted us to defer large-scale
recapitalization of the force for over a decade. In order to maintain the technological superiority of U.S.
forces, we must selectively increase modernization funding to both introduce new systems, and replace
aging Cold War-era equipment as it reaches the end of its service life.

Closely related to our modernization efforts is the requirement to invest in selected research and
prototype systems while monitoring trends in likely future threats. These prudent steps provide
insurance against the possibility that some of our efforts to shape the international environment in ways
favorable to U.S. interests do not succeed. Although such insurance is certainly not free, it is a relatively
inexpensive way to manage risk in an uncertain, resource-constrained environment--that is, the risk of
being unprepared to meet a new threat, the risk of developing the wrong capabilities, and the risk of
producing a capability too early and having it become obsolete by the time it is needed.

The United States cannot hedge against every conceivable future threat. Instead, we should focus our
insurance efforts on threats that, while unlikely, would have highly negative consequences for U.S.
security and would be very expensive to counter were they to emerge. Our current research and
development effort to position the U.S. to deploy a credible national missile defense system within three
years of a deployment decision is an example of this approach.

Without preparing adequately today to face the pressing challenges of tomorrow, our ability to exert
global leadership and to create international conditions conducive to achieving our national goals would
be in doubt. Thus, we must strive to strike the right balance between the near-term requirements of
shaping and responding and the longer-term requirements associated with preparing now for national
security challenges in the twenty-first century.

 

Overarching Capabilities

Critical to our nation's ability to shape the international environment and respond to the full spectrum of
crises--today and tomorrow--are technologies, capabilities and requirements to enable the continued
worldwide application of U.S. national power.

Intelligence

Our intelligence capabilities are critical instruments for implementing our national security strategy.
Comprehensive intelligence capabilities are needed to provide warning of threats to U.S. national
security, give analytical support to the policy and military communities, provide near-real time
intelligence in times of crisis while retaining global perspective, and to identify opportunities for
advancing our national interests.

Today, intelligence operations must cover a wider range of threats and policy needs than ever before and
work more closely with policymaking agencies. We place a high priority on preserving and enhancing
those intelligence collection and analytic capabilities that provide information on states and groups that
pose the most serious threats to U.S. security.

Current intelligence priorities include states whose policies and actions are hostile to the United States;
countries that possess strategic nuclear forces or control nuclear weapons, other WMD or nuclear fissile
materials; transnational threats; potential regional conflicts that might affect U.S. national security
interests; intensified counterintelligence against foreign intelligence collection inimical to U.S. interests;
and threats to U.S. forces and citizens abroad.

Intelligence support is also required to develop and implement U.S. policies to promote democracy
abroad, protect the environment, identify threats to modern information systems, monitor arms control
agreements, and support worldwide humanitarian efforts. The fusion of all intelligence disciplines will
provide the most effective collection and analysis of data on these subjects.

Space

We are committed to maintaining our leadership in space. Uninhibited access to and use of space is
essential for preserving peace and protecting U.S. national security as well as civil and commercial
interests. It is essential to our ability to shape and respond to current and future changes in the
international environment. Our space policy objectives include deterring threats to our interest in space
and defeating hostile efforts against U.S. space assets if deterrence fails, preventing the spread of
weapons of mass destruction to space, and enhancing global partnerships with other space-faring nations
across the spectrum of economic, political and security issues.

Missile Defense

We have highly effective missile defense development programs designed to protect our country,
deployed U.S. forces and our friends and allies against ballistic missiles armed with conventional
weapons or WMD. These programs and systems complement and strengthen our deterrence and
nonproliferation efforts by reducing incentives for potential proliferators to develop or use WMD.
Significantly, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin agreed at the Helsinki Summit to maintain the ABM Treaty
as a cornerstone of strategic stability, yet adapt it to meet the threat posed by shorter-range missiles a
threat we seek to counter through our theater missile defense (TMD) systems. The agreement is
consistent with planned U.S. TMD programs, all of which have been certified by the United States as
compliant with the ABM Treaty.

Although the intelligence community does not believe it likely that any hostile state will develop an
intercontinental-range missile capability that could threaten our nation in the foreseeable future, we are
developing missile defense programs that position the U.S. to deploy a credible national missile defense
system should a threat materialize.

Information Infrastructure
The national security posture of the United States is increasingly dependent on our information

 

infrastructures. These infrastructures are highly interdependent and are increasingly vulnerable to
tampering and exploitation. Concepts and technologies are being developed and employed to protect and
defend against these vulnerabilities; we must fully implement them to ensure the future security of not
only our national information infrastructures, but our nation as well.

National Security Emergency Preparedness

We will do all we can to prevent destructive forces such as terrorism, WMD use, sabotage of our
information systems and natural disasters from endangering our citizens. But if an emergency occurs, we
must also be prepared to respond effectively to protect lives and property and ensure the survival of our
institutions and national infrastructure. National security emergency preparedness is imperative, and
comprehensive, all-hazard emergency planning by Federal departments and agencies continues to be a
crucial national security requirement.

Promoting Prosperity

The second core objective of our national security strategy is to promote America's prosperity through
efforts both at home and abroad. Our economic and security interests are inextricably linked. Prosperity
at home depends on our leadership in the global economy. The strength of our diplomacy, our ability to
maintain an unrivaled military, the attractiveness of our values abroad all depend in part on the strength
of our economy.

Enhancing American Competitiveness

Our primary economic goal remains to strengthen the American economy. We will continue to pursue
deficit reduction with a goal of balancing the federal budget by 2002. By cutting the deficit and
balancing the budget, government borrows less, freeing capital for private sector investment. We seek to
create a business environment in which the innovative and competitive efforts of the private sector can
flourish; encourage the development, commercialization and use of civilian technology; invest in a
world-class infrastructure for the twenty-first century, including the national information infrastructure
for our knowledge-based economy; invest in education and training to develop a workforce capable of
participating in our rapidly changing economy; and continue our efforts to open foreign markets to U.S.
goods and services.

Enhancing Access to Foreign Markets

Our prosperity as a nation in the twenty-first century also depends upon our ability to compete and win
in international markets. The rapidly expanding global economy presents enormous opportunities for
American companies and workers. Over the next decade the global economy is expected to grow at three
times the rate of the U.S. economy. Growth will be particularly powerful in emerging markets. Our
economic future will increasingly rest on tapping into these global opportunities.

In a world where over 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside the United States, we must
export to sustain economic growth at home. If we do not seize these opportunities, our competitors
surely will. We must therefore continue working hard over the next four years to secure and enforce
agreements that enable Americans to compete fairly in foreign markets.

Trade negotiating authority is essential for advancing our nation's economic interests. Congress has
consistently recognized that the President must have the authority to break down foreign trade barriers
and create good jobs. Accordingly, the Administration will work with Congress to fashion an
appropriate grant of fast track negotiating authority.

Over the next four years, the Administration will continue to press our trading partners--multilaterally,
regionally and bilaterally to expand export opportunities for U.S. workers, farmers and companies. We
will position ourselves at the center of a constellation of trade relationships--such as the World Trade
Organization, APEC, the Transatlantic Marketplace and the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).
We will seek to negotiate agreements in sectors where the U.S. is most competitive, as we did in the
Information Technology Agreement and the WTO Telecommunications Services Agreement. We will

 

 

remain vigilant in enforcing the trade agreements reached with our trading partners. That is why the U.S.
Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce created offices in 1996 dedicated to ensuring
foreign governments are fully implementing their commitments under these agreements.

World Trade Organization (WTO). The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of negotiations
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade significantly strengthened the world trading system.
The U.S. economy is expected to gain over $100 billion per year in GDP once the Uruguay Round is
fully implemented. The Administration remains committed to carrying forward the success of the
Uruguay Round and to the success of the WTO as a forum to resolve disputes openly.

We have completed the Information Technology Agreement which goes far toward eliminating tariffs on
high technology products and amounts to a global annual tax cut of $5 billion. We also concluded a
landmark WTO agreement that will dramatically liberalize world trade in telecommunications services.
Under this agreement, covering over 99 percent of WTO member telecommunications revenues, a
decades old tradition of telecommunications monopolies and closed markets will give way to market
opening deregulation and competition principles championed by the United States. We would use fast
track authority to negotiate agreements in other such sectors where the U.S. is most competitive. We will
attempt to conclude by the end of 1997 a new agreement to open trade in financial services. The WTO
agenda also envisions further negotiations to reform agriculture and liberalize trade in services in 1999.

In the WTO we also have a full agenda of accession negotiations-- countries seeking to join the WTO.
As always, the United States is setting high standards for accession in terms of adherence to the rules
and market access. Accessions offer an opportunity to help ground new economies in the rules-based
trading system. This is why we will take an active role in the accession process dealing with the 28
applicants currently seeking WTO membership. The Administration believes that it is in our interest that
China become a member of the WTO; however, we have been steadfast in leading the effort to ensure
that China's accession to the WTO occurs on a commercial basis. China maintains many barriers that
must be eliminated, and we need to ensure that necessary reforms are agreed to before accession occurs.
Russia's WTO accession could play a crucial part in confirming, and assuring, Russia's transition to a
market economy, enhanced competitiveness and successful integration into the world economy.

North America: Since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), our exports
to Mexico have risen significantly while the Agreement helped stabilize Mexico through its worst
financial crisis in modern history. Considering Mexico is our third-largest trading partner, it is
imperative that its market remain open to the United States and NAFTA helps to ensure that. We will
continue working with Mexico and interested private parties to consolidate NAFTA's gains and continue
the mutually beneficial trade with our largest trading partner and neighbor to the north, Canada.

Latin America: Latin America has become the second fastest growing economic region in the world,
and by 2010, our exports to Latin America and Canada will likely exceed those to Europe and Japan
combined. In 1994 hemispheric leaders committed to negotiate the FTAA by 2005; since then,
considerable progress has been made in laying the groundwork. We are also committed to delivering on
the President's promise to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement with Chile because of its
extraordinary economic performance and its logical position as our next trade partner in this hemisphere.
Our ability to do so with fast track negotiating authority in hand will be viewed as a litmus test for trade
expansion and U.S. interest in leading the hemisphere toward the creation of the FTAA.

Asia Pacific: Our economic strength depends on our ability to seize opportunities in the Asia Pacific
region. This region is the world's fastest-growing economic area with half of the world's GDP (including
the U.S., Canada and Mexico). Fully 60 percent of U.S. merchandise exports went to APEC economies
in 1996 30 percent to Asian countries. U.S. initiatives in APEC will open new opportunities for
economic cooperation and permit U.S. companies to expand their involvement in substantial
infrastructure planning and construction throughout the region. While our progress in APEC has been
gratifying, we will explore options to encourage all Asia Pacific nations to pursue open markets.

e China: The emergence of a politically stable, economically open and secure China is in America's
interest. Our focus will be on integrating China into the market-based world economic system. An

 

 

important part of this process will be opening China's highly protected market through lower
border barriers and removal of distorting restraints on economic activity. We have negotiated
landmark agreements to combat piracy and advance the interests of our creative industries. We
have also negotiated and vigorously enforced agreements on textile trade.

e Japan: The Administration continues to make progress with Asia's largest economy in increasing
market access. We have reached market access agreements with Japan covering a range of key
sectors, from autos and auto parts to telecommunications and intellectual property rights. While
our exports to Japan are at record levels, we must now ensure that these agreements are fully
implemented. We must also encourage domestic demand-led growth in Japan and further
deregulation that opens more sectors of Japan's economy to competition.

Europe: Together, Europe and the United States produce over half of all global goods and services. As
part of the New Transatlantic Agenda launched at the 1995 U.S.-EU Summit in Madrid, the U.S. and the
EU agreed to take concrete steps to reduce barriers to trade and investment through the creation of a
New Transatlantic Marketplace, with a focus on non-tariff barriers which impede transatlantic
commerce. The Transatlantic Business Dialogue comprised of American and European business leaders
contributed to the Summit's priorities by focusing on an agreement necessary to reduce barriers in U.S.
trade and investment. Our business community strongly supports our current negotiations to complete
Mutual Recognition Agreements to eliminate redundant testing and certification requirements between
the United States and the EU in sectors where trade totals over $40 billion.

Through OECD negotiations of a Multilateral Agreement on Investment, we are seeking to establish
clear legal standards on expropriation, access to binding international arbitration for disputes and
unrestricted investment-related transfers across borders. These negotiations help further our efforts
related to investment issues in Asia and in the WTO.

Export Strategy and Advocacy Program

The Administration created America's first national export strategy, reforming the way government
works with the private sector to expand exports. The new Trade Promotion Coordination Committee
(TPCC) has been instrumental in improving export promotion efforts, coordinating our export financing,
implementing a government-wide advocacy initiative and updating market information systems and
product standards education.

The export strategy is working, with the United States regaining its position as the world's largest
exporter. While our strong export performance has supported millions of new, export-related jobs, we
must export more in the years ahead if we are to further strengthen our trade balance position and raise
living standards with high-wage jobs. Our objective remains to expand U.S. exports to over $1.2 trillion
by the year 2000, which will mean over five million new American jobs and a total of over 16 million
jobs supported by exports.

Export Control Reform

Through reforming the export licensing system, we seek to support U.S. exporters! efforts to compete on
a level playing field with their foreign competition by removing unnecessarily burdensome licensing
requirements left over from the Cold War. We seek continued appropriate refinements to the dual-use
and munitions licensing process and enactment of a new Export Administration Act, while still ensuring
that our nonproliferation interests are safeguarded. We will also, as part of our multilateral export control
efforts, push partners to adopt and follow similar practices to advance mutually beneficial
nonproliferation efforts.

Other Economic Objectives

We are confronting bribery and corruption by seeking to have OECD members criminalize the bribery of
foreign officials and eliminate the tax deductibility of foreign bribes and by promoting greater
transparency in government procurement regimes. To date, our efforts on procurement have been
concentrated in the World Bank and the regional development banks. Our initiative at the recent WTO
meeting in Singapore to pursue an agreement on transparency in all WTO member procurement regimes
should make an additional important contribution to our efforts.

 

 

On trade and labor we have made important strides. The Singapore WTO Ministerial endorsed the
importance of core labor standards sought by the United States since the Eisenhower Administration the
right to organize, the right to bargain collectively and prohibitions against child labor and forced labor.
We will continue pressing for a working party on labor issues in the WTO.

We continue seeking assurances that liberalization of trade does not come at the expense of
environmental protection. Our leadership in the Uruguay Round negotiations led to the incorporation of
environmental provisions into the WTO Agreements and creation of the Committee on Trade and
Environment, where governments continue the task of ensuring that trade and environment are mutually
supportive. In addition, with U.S. leadership, countries participating in the FTAA are engaged in
sustainable development initiatives to ensure that economic growth does not come at the cost of
environmental protection.

Strengthening Macroeconomic Coordination

Our strategy recognizes that as national economies become more integrated internationally, the United
States cannot thrive in isolation from developments abroad. Working with other countries and
international economic institutions, we have improved our capacity to prevent and mitigate international
financial crises. These efforts include the creation of a more effective early warning and prevention
system with an emphasis on improved disclosure of financial and economic data; a doubling of
resources available to respond in the event crises occur; and a review of procedures that might facilitate
the orderly resolution of international debt crises. The G-7 has also made progress on improving
cooperation among financial regulatory authorities and strengthening supervision of major financial
institutions. These steps should help limit the risk of major financial institution collapse and limit
damage to other institutions in the event a crisis occurs.

The G-7 is also promoting a range of World Bank and regional development bank reforms that the
United States has been urging for a number of years. Key elements include substantially increasing the
share of resources devoted to basic social programs that reduce poverty; safeguarding the environment;
supporting development of the private sector and open markets; promotion of good governance,
including measures to fight corruption; and internal reforms of the Multilateral Development Banks
(MDBs) to make them more efficient. Furthermore, international financial institutions such as the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and MDBs have played a strong role in recent years in countries and
regions of key interest to the United States, such as Russia, the Middle East, Haiti and Bosnia.

Providing for Energy Security

The United States depends on oil for more than 40 percent of its primary energy needs. Roughly half of
our oil needs are met with imports, and a large, though diminishing, share of these imports come from
the Persian Gulf area. However, we are also undergoing a fundamental shift in our reliance on imported
oil away from the Middle East. Venezuela is now the number one foreign supplier to the United States;
Canada, Mexico and Venezuela combined supply more than twice as much oil to the United States as the
Arab OPEC countries; and Venezuela and Colombia are each undertaking new oi! production ventures.
The Caspian Basin, with potential oil reserves of 200 billion barrels, also promises to play an
increasingly important role in meeting rising world energy demand in coming decades. While we must
keep these developments in mind, we cannot lose sight of the fact that for the long term, the vast
majority of the proven oil reserves still reside in the Middle East and that the global oil market is largely
interdependent.

Over the longer term, U.S. dependence on access to these foreign oil sources will be increasingly
important as our resources are depleted. The U.S. economy has grown roughly 75 percent since the first
oil shock; during that time our oil consumption has remained virtually stable but domestic oil production
has declined. High oil prices did not generate enough new oil exploration and discovery to sustain
production levels from our depleted resource base. Conservation measures notwithstanding, the United
States has a vital interest in ensuring access to this critical resource.

 

 

Promoting Sustainable Development Abroad

Sustainable development improves the prospects for democracy in developing countries and expands the
demand for U.S. exports. It alleviates pressure on the global environment, reduces the attraction of the
illegal drug trade and improves health and economic productivity.

Rapid urbanization is outstripping the ability of many nations to provide jobs, education and other
services to their citizens. The continuing poverty of a quarter of the world's people leads to hunger,
malnutrition, economic migration and political unrest. New diseases, such as AIDS, and other epidemics
that can spread through environmental damage, threaten to overwhelm the health facilities of developing
countries, disrupt societies and stop economic growth.

USS. foreign assistance focuses on four key elements of sustainable development: broad-based economic
growth, the environment, population and health, and democracy. We will continue to advocate
environmentally sound private investment and responsible approaches by international lenders. The
MDBs are now placing increased emphasis upon sustainable development in their funding decisions,
including assisting borrowing countries to better manage their economies. The Global Environmental
Facility provides a source of financial assistance to the developing world for climate change,
biodiversity and oceans initiatives that will benefit all the world's citizens.

Environment and Sustainable Development

Environmental and natural resource issues can impede sustainable development efforts and promote
regional instability. That is why the U.S. will aggressively lead efforts to address this issue at the June
1997 UN General Assembly Special Session on Environment and Development. Environmental damage
in countries of the NIS and Central and Eastern Europe continues to impede their ability to emerge as
prosperous, independent countries. In addition, the effects of climate change and ozone depletion know
no borders and can pose grave dangers to our nation and the world. We seek to accomplish the
following:

e forge an international consensus to address the challenge of global climate change, as evidenced
by threats such as rising sea levels, the spread of tropical disease and more frequent and severe
storms;

e achieve increased compliance with the Montreal Protocol through domestic and multilateral
efforts aimed at curbing illegal trade in ozone depleting substances;

e implement the UN Straddling Stocks Agreement, ratify the Law of the Sea Convention and help to
promote sustainable management of fisheries worldwide;

¢ implement the Program of Action on population growth developed at the 1994 Cairo Conference;

e expand bilateral forest assistance programs and promote sustainable management of tropical
forests;

focus technical assistance and encourage nongovernmental environmental groups to provide
expertise to the NIS and Central and Eastern European nations that have suffered the most acute
environmental crises;

e achieve Senate ratification of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements
of Hazardous Wastes;

lead a renewed global effort to address population problems and promote international consensus
for stabilizing world population growth; and

e achieve Senate ratification of the Biodiversity Convention and take steps to slow or stop
biodiversity loss. These steps include supporting agricultural research to relieve pressures on

 

forests, working with MDBs and others to prevent biodiversity loss in key regions, and use of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to protect threatened species.

Promoting Democracy

The third core objective of our national security strategy is to promote democracy and human rights. The
number of states moving away from repressive governance toward democratic and publicly accountable
institutions is impressive. Since the success of many of those changes is by no means assured, our
strategy must focus on strengthening their commitment and institutional capacity to implement
democratic reforms.

Emerging Democracies

We seek international support in helping strengthen democratic and free market institutions and norms in
countries making the transition from closed to open societies. This commitment to see freedom and
respect for human rights take hold is not only just, but pragmatic, for strengthened democratic
institutions benefit the U.S. and the world.

By helping consolidate democratic and market reforms in the NIS, we are assisting them to develop into
valued diplomatic and economic partners. Our intensified interaction with Ukraine has helped move that
country onto the path of economic reform, which is critical to its long-term stability. In addition, our
efforts in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere facilitate our goal of achieving continued reductions in nuclear
arms and compliance with international nonproliferation accords.

The new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe are similarly key. Eventual integration into
European security and economic organizations, such as NATO and the EU, will help lock in and
preserve the impressive progress these nations have made in instituting democratic and market-economic
reforms.

Continuing to nurture advances toward democracy and markets in our own hemisphere remains a
priority, as reflected by the President's trips to Latin America and the Caribbean this year and the
preparations for the Summit of the Americas in Santiago next year. In the Asia Pacific region, economic
dynamism is increasingly associated with political modernization, democratic evolution and the
widening of the rule of law--and it has global impacts. We are particularly attentive to states whose entry
into the camp of market democracies may influence the future direction of an entire region; South Africa
now holds that potential with regard to sub-Saharan Africa.

The methods for assisting emerging democracies are as varied as the nations involved. We must
continue leading efforts to mobilize international economic and political resources, as we have with
Russia, Ukraine and the other NIS. We must take firm action to help counter attempts to reverse

~ democracy, as we have in Haiti, Guatemala and Paraguay. We must give democratic nations the fullest
benefits of integration into foreign markets, which is part of the reason NAFTA and the Uruguay Round
of GATT ranked so high on our agenda and why we are now working to forge the FTAA. We must help
these nations strengthen the pillars of civil society, supporting administration of justice and rule of law
programs, assisting the development of democratic civil-military relations and providing human rights
training to foreign police and security forces. And we must seek to improve their market institutions and
fight corruption and political discontent by encouraging good governance practices.

Adherence to Universal Human Rights
and Democratic Principles

At the same time, we must sustain our efforts to press for political liberalization and respect for basic
human rights worldwide, including in countries that continue to defy democratic advances. Working
through multilateral institutions, the United States promotes universal adherence to international human
rights and democratic principles. Our efforts in the United Nations and other organizations are helping to
make these principles the governing standards for acceptable international behavior.

 

 

We must also work with multilateral institutions to ensure that international human rights principles
protect the most vulnerable or traditionally oppressed groups in the world women, children, workers,
refugees and persons persecuted on the basis of their religious beliefs or ethnic descent. To this end, we
will seek to strengthen and improve international mechanisms that promote human rights, such as the
UN Human Rights Commission, and will intensify our efforts to establish a Permanent Criminal Court
to address violations of international humanitarian law building on the efforts of the International War
Crimes Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Bosnia.

To focus additional attention on the more vulnerable or traditionally oppressed people, we will seek to
spearhead new international initiatives to combat the sexual exploitation of minors, forms of child labor,
homelessness among children, violence against women and children, and female genital mutilation. We
will encourage governments to not return people to countries where they face persecution--to provide
asylum as appropriate, to offer temporary protection to persons fleeing situations of conflict or
generalized human rights abuses, and to ensure that such persons are not returned without due
consideration of their need for permanent protection. And we will work with international institutions to
combat religious persecution.

The United States will continue to speak out against human rights abuses and we will carry on human
tights dialogues with countries willing to engage us constructively. In appropriate circumstances, we
must be prepared to take strong measures against human rights violators. These include economic
sanctions, as have been maintained against Nigeria, Iraq, Burma and Cuba; visa restrictions; and
restrictions on the sales of arms that we believe may be used to perpetrate human rights abuses.

Finally, the United States itself must continue to demonstrate its willingness to adhere to international
human rights standards. In particular, we must move forward on ratification of the convention
prohibiting discrimination against women and the convention on the rights of the child.

Humanitarian Assistance

Our efforts to promote democracy and human rights are complemented by our humanitarian assistance
programs, which are designed to alleviate human suffering, to help establish democratic regimes that
respect human rights and to pursue appropriate strategies for economic development. These efforts also
enable the United States to help prevent humanitarian disasters with far more significant resource
implications.

We also must seek to promote reconciliation in states experiencing civil conflict and to address
migration and refugee crises. To this end, the United States will provide appropriate financial support
and work with other nations and international bodies, such as the International Committee of the Red
Cross and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. We also will assist efforts to protect the rights of
refugees and displaced persons and to address the economic and social root causes of internal
displacement and international flight. Finally, we will cooperate with other states to curb illegal
immigration into this country.

Private firms and associations are natural allies in activities and efforts intended to bolster market
economies. We have natural partners in labor unions, human rights groups, environmental advocates,
chambers of commerce and election monitors in promoting democracy and respect for human rights and
in providing international humanitarian assistance; thus, we should promote democratization efforts
through private and nongovernmental groups as well as foreign governments.

Supporting the global movement toward democracy requires a pragmatic and long-term effort focused
on both values and institutions. Our goal is a broadening of the community of market democracies, and
strengthened international non-governmental movements committed to human rights and
democratization.

 

III. Integrated Regional Approaches

Our policies toward different regions reflect our overall strategy tailored to their unique challenges and
opportunities.

Europe and Eurasia

European stability is vital to our own security. Our objective is to complete the construction of a truly
integrated, democratic and secure Europe, with a democratic Russia as a full participant. This would
complete the mission the United States launched 50 years ago with the Marshall Plan and the creation of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO remains the anchor of American engagement in Europe
and the linchpin of transatlantic security. As a guarantor of European democracy and a force for
European stability, NATO must play the leading role in promoting a more integrated, secure Europe
prepared to respond to new challenges. We will maintain approximately 100,000 military personnel in
Europe to preserve U.S. influence and leadership in NATO, sustain our vital transatlantic ties, provide a
visible deterrent, respond to crises and contribute to regional stability. The increasing links between
NATO and Partnership for Peace nations form the foundation for Partners to contribute to real-world
NATO missions, as many are doing in the Stabilization Force (SFOR) operation in Bosnia.

At the July 1997 NATO Summit in Madrid, the Alliance will move forward on its agenda for NATO's
adaptation and enlargement. We will invite one or more aspiring members to begin accession talks, with
the goal of full entry for the first new members by NATO's 50th anniversary in 1999. At the same time,
we will intensify efforts to work with countries not included in the first group of invitees, such as
enhancing the Partnership for Peace, launching the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and developing an
enhanced NATO-Ukraine relationship. We also want to finalize various aspects of the Alliance's internal
adaptation, including a new command structure and arrangements for a stronger European security and
defense identity within--rather than separate from--NATO. Parallel to NATO enlargement, we seek to
define a new and coherent NATO-Russia partnership one that ensures Russia's full participation in the
post-Cold War European security system.

Enlarging the Alliance will promote our interests by reducing the risk of instability or conflict in
Europe's eastern half. It will help ensure that no part of Europe will revert to a zone of great power
competition or a sphere of influence. It will build confidence and give new democracies a powerful
incentive to consolidate their reforms. NATO enlargement will not be aimed at replacing one division of
Europe with a new one; rather, its purpose is to enhance the security of all European states.

We will also continue to strengthen the OSCE's role in conflict prevention and crisis management and
seek closer cooperation with our European partners in dealing with non-military security threats through
our New Transatlantic Agenda with the EU.

Balkans: At the same time as we work to construct a comprehensive European security architecture, we
must also focus on regional security challenges. We remain committed to the goals of the Dayton
Accords. In Bosnia we seek to help create conditions-- through political reconciliation and economic
revitalization--for a self-sustaining peace, one that can ensure stability in the country and the Balkans as
a whole and permit a timely exit of NATO military forces from Bosnia at the end of SFOR's mission.
We support the efforts of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and aim to see
Bosnia's Balkan neighbors embarked on the path of democracy and market reform--including Serbia's
restoration of autonomy to Kosovo and the return of civil society and democracy to Albania.

Southeastern Europe: There are significant security challenges in southeastern Europe. The interrelated
issues of Cyprus, Greek-Turkish disagreements in the Aegean, and Turkey's relationship with Europe
have serious consequences for regional stability and the evolution of European political and security
structures; thus, our immediate goals are to stabilize the region by reducing long-standing Greek-Turkish
tensions and to pursue a comprehensive settlement on Cyprus. A democratic, secular, stable and

 

 

Western-oriented Turkey has supported U.S. efforts to enhance stability in Bosnia, the NIS and the
Middle East, as well as to contain Iran and Iraq. Its continued ties to the West and its support for our
overall strategic objectives in one of the world's most sensitive regions is critical. We continue to
support Turkey's active, constructive role within NATO and Europe.

Northern Ireland: In Northern Ireland, we will continue our efforts to encourage an end to the conflict
that has claimed more than 3,200 lives over the past 25 years, and are committed to support the efforts of
the British and Irish Governments to bring about a just and lasting settlement. The United States will
continue to push for real progress, standing with those who take risks for peace and helping bring
tangible benefits of peace to those whose lives will be affected.

NIS: The United States has vital security interests in the evolution of Russia, Ukraine and the other NIS
into stable, modern democracies, peacefully and prosperously integrated into a world community where
representative government, the rule of law, free and fair trade and cooperative security are the norm. An
important element in this evolution will be the development of an effective NATO-Russian partnership.
In making the most of post-Communist pluralism providing support to reformers wherever they are to be
found, notably including the non-governmental sector and the regions outside national capitals we must
remain steady in pursuing four strategic objectives:

e reducing the threat of nuclear war and the spread of nuclear weapons and materials, as well as
other weapons of mass destruction;

e helping the NIS continue their transition toward democratic, market economies integrated into the
community of free-trading democracies;

© bringing Russia, Ukraine and the other NIS into a new, post-Cold War European security order;
and

© cooperating with all states of the NIS in ending ethnic and regional conflict while bolstering their
independence.

The United States strongly supports the process of European integration embodied in the European
Union and seeks to deepen our economic partnership with the EU. At the same time, we are encouraging
bilateral trade and investment in non-EU countries, while supporting appropriate enlargement of the
European Union. We recognize that EU nations face significant economic challenges with nearly 20
million people unemployed, and that economic stagnation has eroded public support for funding
outward-looking foreign policies and greater integration. We are working closely with our West
European partners to expand employment and promote long-term growth in the G-7, and to support the
New Transatlantic Agenda, which moves the U.S.-EU relationship from consultation to joint action on a
range of shared interests.

In supporting historic market reforms in Central and Eastern Europe and in the NIS, we both strengthen
our own economy and help new democracies take root. Poland, economically troubled as recently as
1989, now symbolizes the new dynamism and rapid growth that extensive, democratic, free market
reforms make possible. Today, more than 70 percent of Russia's GDP is generated by the private sector,
while Ukraine's economic reforms have helped consolidate Ukrainian statehood and democratization.
But much remains to be done to assure durable economic recovery and social protection. We will
continue to mobilize the international community to provide structural economic assistance. Through the
Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, the United States is working closely with Russia in priority areas,
including defense conversion, the environment, trade and investment, and scientific and technological
cooperation.

Ultimately, the success of market reforms in the countries recently emerged from communism will

depend more on trade and investment than official aid. One of our priorities, therefore, is to reduce trade
barriers. At the Helsinki Summit, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin defined an ambitious reform agenda

 

 

 

covering key tax, energy and commercial laws crucial for Russia to realize its potential for attracting
foreign investment. Further, the Presidents outlined steps that would accelerate Russian membership on
commercial terms in key economic organizations such as the WTO and the Paris Club. It is in both
Russia's interest and ours that we work with the Russian government toward passage of key economic
and commercial legislation, as we continue to support American investment and Russia's integration into
various international economic institutions.

Ukraine is also at an important point in its economic transition--one that will affect its integration with
Europe and the prosperity of its people. Two challenges stand out: first, to instill respect for the rule of
law so that international principles of the marketplace and democratic governance prevail; and, second,
to gain international support as it seeks to close down Chornobyl and reform its energy sector. We seek
support from the international community to help Ukraine's economic transformation and its goal of
attracting foreign investment and stimulating domestic growth.

A stable and prosperous Caucasus and Central Asia will help promote stability and security from the
Mediterranean to China and facilitate rapid development and transport to international markets of the
large Caspian oil and gas resources, with substantial U.S. commercial participation. While the new states
in the region have made progress in their quest for sovereignty, stability, prosperity and a secure place in
the international arena, much remains to be done--in particular in resolving regional conflicts such as
Nagorno-Karabakh.

Democratic reforms in the NIS and Europe's former communist states are the best answer to the
aggressive nationalism and ethnic hatreds unleashed by the end of the Cold War. Already, the prospect
of joining or rejoining the Western democratic family has dampened the forces of nationalism and
strengthened the forces of democracy and reform in many countries of the region.

The independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the twelve NIS, as well as of the three Baltic
states, are especially important to American interests. So is their political and economic reform. Our
instruments for advancing these goals are our bilateral relationships, our leadership of international
institutions and the billions of dollars in private and multilateral resources that we can help mobilize. But
the circumstances affecting the smaller countries depend in significant measure on the fate of reform in
the largest and most powerful Russia. The United States will continue to vigorously promote Russian
reform and discourage any reversal in the progress that has been made. Our economic and political
support for the Russian government depends on its commitment to reform, including democratization,
market economics and a foreign policy of comity, especially with respect to other former Soviet
republics.

East Asia and the Pacific

Four years ago, President Clinton laid out his vision of a new Pacific community--a vision that links
security interests with economic growth and our commitment to democracy and human rights. We now
seek to build on that vision, cementing America's role as a stabilizing force in a more integrated Asia
Pacific region.

Our military presence has been essential to maintaining the stability that has enabled most nations in the
Asia Pacific region to build thriving economies for the benefit of all. To deter regional aggression and
secure our own interests, we will maintain an active presence. Our treaty alliances with Japan, South
Korea, Australia, Thailand, and the Philippines, and our commitment to keeping approximately 100,000
USS. military personnel in the region, serve as the foundation for America's continuing security role.

We have supported new regional dialogues such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) on the full range

of common security challenges. By meeting on confidence-building measures such as search and rescue
cooperation and peacekeeping, the ARF can help enhance regional security and understanding.

Japan: The United States and Japan reaffirmed last year that our bilateral security relationship

 

 

remains the cornerstone for achieving common security objectives and for maintaining a stable
and prosperous environment for the Asia Pacific region as we enter the twenty-first century. This
security cooperation extends to promoting regional peace and stability, seeking universal
adherence to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and addressing the dangers posed by transfers
of destabilizing conventional arms and sensitive dual-use goods and technologies. Our continued
progress in assisting open trade between our two countries and our broad-ranging international
cooperation exemplified by the Common Agenda provide a sound underpinning for our relations
in the next century.

Korean Peninsula: Tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain the principal threat to the peace and
stability of the East Asia region. A peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict with a non-nuclear
peninsula is in our strategic interest. A parallel strategic interest is the elimination of a
chemical/biological threat on the peninsula. A productive North-South dialogue would be a
positive step in this direction. We are working to create conditions of stability by maintaining the
U.S.-Republic of Korea treaty alliance and our military presence; freezing and eventually
dismantling the North Korean nuclear program under the Agreed Framework; developing bilateral
contacts with the North aimed at drawing the North into a set of more normal relations with the
region and the rest of the world; and following through on the offer of four-party peace talks
among the United States, China, and North and South Korea. Over the next four years, we will
maintain solidarity with our South Korean ally, ensure that an isolated and struggling North Korea
does not opt for a military solution to its problems, and emphasize America's commitment to
shaping a peaceful and prosperous Korean Peninsula. At the same time, we are willing to improve
bilateral political and economic ties with the North, commensurate with its continued cooperation
to resolve the nuclear issue, engagement in North-South dialogue, continued efforts to recover
remains of American servicemen missing since the Korean War, and cessation of its chemical and
biological programs and ballistic missile proliferation activities.

China: An overarching U.S. interest is China's emergence as a stable, open, secure and peaceful
state. The prospects for peace and prosperity in Asia depend heavily on China's role as a
responsible member of the international community. China's integration into the international
system of rules and norms will influence its own political and economic development, as well as
its relations with the rest of the world. Our success in working with China as a partner in building
a stable international order depends on establishing a productive relationship that will build
sustained domestic support. We have already enhanced our cooperation in key areas, such as
working for peace and stability in Korea, extending the NPT and completing the CTBT, and
combating alien smuggling and drugs. Our key security objectives include:

o sustaining the strategic dialogue begun by the recent series of high-level exchanges with
attention to core interests on both sides;

o resumption of the cross-Strait dialogue between Beijing and Taipei, and a smooth transition
in Hong Kong;

o PRC adherence to international nonproliferation norms, establishment of a comprehensive
export control system, and the conditions that would permit implementation of the 1985
agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy; and

o the PRC's constructive role in international security affairs through active cooperation in
APEC, ARF and the Northeast Asia Security Dialogue.

Southeast Asia: Our strategic interest in Southeast Asia centers on developing regional and
bilateral security and economic relationships that assist in conflict prevention and resolution and
expand U.S. participation in the region's dynamic growth. Our policy combines two approaches:
first, maintaining our increasingly productive relationship with the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam) especially
our security dialogue under the ARF; and second, pursuing bilateral objectives with ASEAN's
individual members and other Southeast Asian nations, designed to prevent political or military

 

 

instability, establish market-oriented economic reforms, resist the flow of heroin from Burma, and
encourage democratic reforms and improvements in human rights practices. Our security aims in
Southeast Asia are twofold: (1) maintaining robust security alliances with Canberra, Manila and
Bangkok, as well as sustaining security access arrangements with Singapore and other ASEAN
countries; and (2) healthy, pragmatic relations with a strong, cohesive ASEAN capable of
supporting regional stability and prosperity.

We are committed to sustaining the Asia Pacific region's remarkable dynamism. Opportunities for
economic growth abound in Asia and underlie our strong commitment to multilateral economic
cooperation. Today, the 18 member economies of APEC--comprising about one-third of the world's
population produce $13 trillion and export $1.7 trillion of goods annually, about one-half of the global
totals. U.S. exports to Asian economies support millions of American jobs, while U.S. direct
investments in Asia represent about one-fifth of total U.S. direct foreign investment. A prosperous and
open Asia Pacific is key to the economic health of the United States. Annual APEC leaders meetings are
a vivid testament to the possibilities of stimulating regional economic growth and cooperation--fostering
trade and investment liberalization, while at the same time enhancing political and security ties within
the region.

We are also working with major bilateral trade partners to improve trade relations. The United States and
Japan have successfully completed over 20 bilateral trade agreements under the 1993 Framework
Agreement, designed to open Japan's markets to U.S. goods. As U.S.-China trade continues to grow, we
place a high priority on bilateral and multilateral trade issues, such as intellectual property rights and
market access.

Our economic objectives include: continued progress within APEC toward liberalizing trade and
investment, increased exports to Asian countries through market-opening measures and leveling the
playing field for U.S. business, and WTO accession for the PRC and Taiwan on satisfactory commercial
terms.

Some have argued that democracy is unsuited for Asia or at least for some Asian nations that human
rights are relative and that Western nations' support for international human rights standards simply
mask a form of cultural imperialism. The democratic aspirations and achievements of Asian peoples
themselves prove these arguments incorrect. We will continue to support those aspirations and to
promote respect for human rights in all nations.

Each nation must find its own form of democracy, and we respect the variety of democratic institutions
that have emerged in Asia. But there is no cultural justification for tyranny, torture or the denial of
fundamental freedoms. Our strategy includes efforts to:

© pursue a constructive, goal-oriented approach to achieving progress on human rights and rule of
law issues with China;

foster a meaningful dialogue between the ruling authorities in Burma and the democratic
opposition;

promote improved respect for human rights and strengthened democratic processes in Indonesia
and political reconciliation in East Timor;

© build democratic institutions and encourage respect for human rights in Cambodia; and

© promote improved respect for human rights in Vietnam and achieve the fullest possible accounting
of missing U.S. service members.

The Western Hemisphere

 

 

The end of armed conflict in Central America and other improvements in regional security have
coincided with remarkable political and economic progress throughout the hemisphere. Our hemisphere
enters the twenty-first century with an unprecedented opportunity to build a future of stability and
prosperity building on the fact that every nation in the hemisphere except Cuba is democratic and
committed to free market economies.

We are advancing regional security cooperation in a variety of ways, such as bilateral security dialogues,
Organization of American States (OAS) and Summit of the Americas initiatives, regional confidence
and security building measures, exercises and exchanges with key militaries, and regular Defense
Ministerials. As co-guarantor of the Peru-Ecuador peace process we have brought the parties closer to
negotiating a permanent resolution of the decades-old border dispute. And, we are working to ensure a
successful passage of stewardship of the Panama Canal to the Panamanian government.

The principal security concerns in the hemisphere are transnational in nature, such as drug trafficking,
organized crime and money laundering, illegal immigration, and instability generated from corruption
and political or social conflict. Bilaterally and regionally, we seek to eliminate the scourge of drug
trafficking which poses a serious threat to the sovereignty, democracy and national security of nations in
the hemisphere. As part of our comprehensive partnership with Mexico, we continue to increase
counterdrug and law enforcement cooperation, while in the Caribbean we are intensifying a coordinated
effort on counternarcotics, law enforcement and gun smuggling.

The 1994 Summit of the Americas in Miami produced hemispheric agreement on a package of measures
that included continued economic reform and enhanced cooperation on issues such as the environment,
counternarcotics and anti-corruption. Celebrating the region's embrace of democracy and free markets,
the President used that historic event to commit the U.S. to a more mature and cooperative relationship
with the hemisphere. The Summit's centerpiece was the leaders' commitment to negotiate the Free Trade
Area of the Americas by 2005 and other steps to ensure that democracy's benefits are shared by all.

The Summit brought a surge in hemispheric cooperation on issues such as energy, financial integration
and the environment where U.S. agencies have used the Summit Action Plan to establish new
relationships with their Latin American and Caribbean counterparts. The hemispheric response to the
1996 coup attempt in Paraguay--a response led by the OAS, members of the Southern Cone Common
Market (MERCOSUR) and the U.S.--also demonstrated the degree to which our democracy and
economic integration agendas have become mutually reinforcing. Having opened a new chapter in U.S.
relations with Latin America and the Caribbean, we must carry forward the momentum to the 1998
Summit in Chile and continue building towards the Miami vision of an integrated hemisphere of free
market democracies. The Administration seeks to do its part in advancing this vision by consolidating
NAFTA's gains, obtaining congressional fast track negotiating authority and negotiating a
comprehensive free trade agreement with Chile.

At the same time, we must be sensitive to the concern by some small states, such as those in the Eastern
Caribbean, about the impact of an increasingly integrated and more competitive hemispheric economy.
To this end, we must make progress on achieving the benefits of the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) to
help prepare that region for participation in the FTAA.

Our ability to sustain the historic progress of the hemispheric agenda depends in part on meeting the
challenges posed by weak democratic institutions, spiraling unemployment and crime rates, and serious
income disparities. In many Latin American countries, citizens will not fully realize the benefits of
political liberalization and economic growth without regulatory, judicial, law enforcement and
educational reforms, as well as increased efforts to integrate indigenous populations into the formal
economy.

Regarding Cuba, the United States remains committed to promoting a peaceful transition to democracy
and forestalling a mass migration exodus that would endanger the lives of migrants and safety of our
nation. While maintaining pressure on the regime to make political and economic reforms, we seek to
encourage the emergence of a civil society to assist transition to democracy when the change comes. A
growing optimism among Cubans that positive change is possible also helps discourage illegal

 

migration. And, as the Cuban people feel greater incentive to take charge of their own future, they are
more likely to stay at home and build the informal and formal structures that will make transition easier.
Meanwhile, we remain firmly committed to bilateral migration accords that seek to ensure that migration
be through legal and safe means.

The restoration of democracy in Haiti remains a shining example of the positive trends in our
hemisphere. In Haiti we continue to support respect for human rights and economic growth by a Haitian
government capable of managing its own security, paving the way for a Presidential election in 2000
that is free, fair and representative. We are committed to work with our partners in the region and the
international community to support Haiti's economic and political development. Haiti will benefit from a
Caribbean-wide acceleration of growth and investment, stimulated in part by enhancement of CBI
benefits.

Finally, we also seek to strengthen norms for defense establishments that are supportive of democracy,
transparency, respect for human rights and civilian control in defense matters. Through continued
engagement with regional armed forces, facilitated by our own modest military activities and presence in
the region, we are helping to transform military institutions. Through initiatives such as the Defense
Ministerial of the Americas and expanded efforts to increase civilian expertise in defense affairs, we are
reinforcing the positive trend in civil-military relations.

The Middle East, Southwest and South Asia

The United States has enduring interests in pursuing a just, lasting and comprehensive Middle East
peace, ensuring the security and well-being of Israel, helping our Arab friends provide for their security,
and maintaining the free flow of oil at reasonable prices. Our strategy reflects those interests and the
unique characteristics of the region as we work to extend the range of peace and stability.

The Middle East Peace Process: An historic transformation has taken place in the political
landscape of the Middle East: peace agreements are taking hold, requiring concerted
implementation efforts. The United States as an architect and sponsor of the peace process has a
clear national interest in seeing the process deepen and widen to include all Israel's neighbors. We
will continue our steady, determined leadership standing with those who take risks for peace,
standing against those who would destroy it, lending our good offices where we can make a
difference and helping bring the concrete benefits of peace to people's daily lives. Future progress
will require movement in the following inter-related areas:

o continued Israeli-Palestinian engagement on remaining issues in the Interim Agreement, and
negotiation of permanent status issues;

o resuming Israeli-Syrian negotiations and beginning Israeli-Lebanese negotiations with the
objective of achieving peace treaties; and

o normalization of relations between Arab states and Israel.

Southwest Asia: In Southwest Asia, the United States remains focused on deterring threats to
regional stability and protecting the security of our regional partners, particularly from Iraq and
Iran. We will maintain our military presence using a combination of air, land and sea forces and
the demonstrated ability to reinforce rapidly the region in time of crisis.

We would like to see Iraq's reintegration into the international community; however, we have
made clear that Iraq must comply with all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.
We also remain committed to enforcing the no-fly zones through Operations NORTHERN
WATCH and SOUTHERN WATCH. Our policy is directed not against the people of Iraq but
against the aggressive behavior of the government. Until that behavior changes, our goal is
containing the threat Saddam Hussein poses to Iraq's neighbors, its people, the free flow of Gulf

 

 

oil and broader U.S. interests in the Middle East.

As for Iran, our policy is aimed at changing the behavior of the Iranian government in several key
areas, including its efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction and missiles, its support for
terrorism and groups that oppose the peace process, its attempts to undermine friendly
governments in the region, and its development of offensive military capabilities which threaten
our Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) partners and the flow of oil. Pending changes in Iran's
behavior, our goal is to contain and reduce its ability to threaten our interests. We also seek to
coordinate with key allies to maximize pressures on Iran to change its course.

A key objective of our policy in the Gulf is to reduce the chances that another aggressor will
emerge who would threaten the independence of existing states. We will continue to encourage
members of the Gulf Cooperation Council to work closely on collective defense and security
arrangements, help individual GCC states meet their appropriate defense requirements and
maintain our bilateral defense agreements.

Roughly half of our oil needs are met with imports, and a large share of these imports are from the
Persian Gulf region. Previous oil shocks and the Gulf War show the impact that an interruption of
oil supplies can have on the world's economy. Appropriate responses to events such as Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait can limit the magnitude of the crisis. But over the longer term, U.S.
dependence on access to these and other foreign oil sources will remain important as our resources
are depleted. The United States must remain ever vigilant to ensure unrestricted access to this
critical resource. In the Gulf, where global access to critical resources is key, we will continue to
demonstrate U.S. commitment and resolve.

South Asia: South Asia has experienced an important expansion of democracy and economic
reform. Our strategy is designed to help the peoples of that region enjoy the fruits of democracy
and greater stability by helping resolve long-standing conflict and implementing
confidence-building measures. The United States has urged India and Pakistan to take steps to
reduce the risk of conflict and to bring their nuclear and missile programs into conformity with
international standards. Regional stability and improved bilateral ties are also important for
America's economic interest in a region that contains a quarter of the world's population and one
of its most important emerging markets. We seek to establish relationships with India and Pakistan
that are defined in terms of their own individual merits and that reflect the full weight and range of
USS. strategic, political and economic interests in each country. In addition, we seek to work
closely with regional countries to stem the flow of illegal drugs from South Asia, most notably
from Afghanistan.

We will encourage the spread of democratic values throughout the Middle East and Southwest and
South Asia and will pursue this objective by a constructive dialogue with countries in the region. We
will promote responsible indigenous moves toward increasing political participation and enhancing the
quality of governance and will continue to vigorously challenge many governments in the region to
improve their dismal human rights records.

Africa

In recent years, U.S. policies have supported significant changes in Africa: multi-party democracies are
more common; new constitutions have been promulgated; elections are becoming more frequent and
open; the press is more free today; and the need for budgetary and financial discipline is better
understood. While we will not be able to address every challenge or reap every opportunity Africa poses,
we must identify those issues where we can make a difference and which most directly affect our
interests and target our resources efficiently.

Serious transnational security threats emanate from Africa, including: state-sponsored terrorism,
narcotics trafficking, international crime, environmental damage and disease. These threats can only be

 

addressed through effective, sustained engagement in Africa. We have already made significant progress
in countering some of these threats--investing in efforts to combat environmental damage and disease;
leading international efforts to halt the proliferation of land mines; securing the indefinite and
unconditional extension of the NPT; and supporting establishment of the African Nuclear Weapons Free
Zone. We have also worked to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in Africa as
elsewhere. We continue to work for an end to Sudanese support for terrorism, to reduce the flow of
narcotics through Africa, to curtail international criminal activity based in Africa and to diminish the
influence of Libya and Iran in Africa.

Our policy toward Libya is designed to limit its efforts to obtain WMD, its support for terrorism, its
attempts to undermine other governments in the region and its development of military capabilities
which threaten its neighbors. In addition, we seek full Libyan compliance with appropriate UN Security
Council Resolutions. Pending changes in Libya's behavior, our goal is to reduce its ability to threaten
our interests and those of our friends and allies.

One of the key impediments to development in Africa has been the persistence of conflict. Our efforts to
resolve conflict include working to achieve lasting peace in Angola and an end to Liberia's civil war.
The area with the greatest potential for serious conflict remains the Great Lakes region, which could
result in the permanent destabilization of Zaire or a broader regional war. There also remains the risk of
another genocide in the Great Lakes region. The United States continues to be actively engaged in trying
to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflicts in Zaire, Burundi and elsewhere in the region. In 1996,
the United States launched an innovative proposal the African Crisis Response Force (ACRF) initiative
to build African capabilities to conduct effective peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. We will
continue working with donor and African partners to turn this concept into reality.

In the broadest terms, we seek a stable, economically dynamic Africa. This will be impossible to achieve
unless and until Africa is fully integrated into the global economy. Our aim, therefore, is to assist
African nations to implement economic reforms, create favorable climates for trade and investment, and
achieve sustainable development. In addition, we encourage U.S. companies to trade with and invest in
Africa. To this end, we have proposed a ""Partnership for Economic Growth and Opportunity in Africa""
to support the economic transformation underway in Africa. The Administration will work closely with ©
Congress to implement key elements of this initiative aimed, in particular, at helping African countries
pursuing growth-oriented policies sustain growth and development.

We seek to spur economic growth and promote trade and investment by examining new ways to improve
the economic policies of African nations and by sustaining critical bilateral and multilateral development
assistance. While further integrating Africa into the global economy has obvious political and economic
benefits, it will also directly serve U.S. interests by continuing to expand an already important new
market for U.S. exports. The more than 600 million people of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) represent one of
the world's largest remaining untapped markets. The United States exports more to SSA than to all of the
former Soviet Union combined; yet, the U.S. enjoys only seven percent market share in Africa,
Increasing both the U.S. market share and the size of the African market will bring tangible benefits to.
U.S. workers and create wealth in Africa.

In Africa as elsewhere, democracies have proved more peaceful, stable and reliable partners and more
likely to pursue sound economic policies. We will continue to work to sustain the important progress
achieved to date and to broaden the growing circle of African democracies. In addition, we will work
with our allies to find an effective formula for promoting stability, democracy and respect for human
rights in Nigeria, and also in central Africa where widespread unrest and atrocities continue; to support a
sustainable democratic transition in Zaire; and to help South Africa achieve its economic, political and
democratic goals by continuing to provide substantial bilateral assistance, providing support through the
Binational Commission and by aggressively promoting U.S. trade with and investment in South Africa.

IV. Conclusions

Today, closer to the start of the twenty-first century than to the end of the Cold War, we are embarking

 

 

 

on a period of construction to build new frameworks, partnerships and institutions--and adapt existing
ones--that strengthen America's security and prosperity. We are working to construct new cooperative
security arrangements, rid the world of weapons that target whole populations, build a truly global
economy, and promote democratic values and economic reform. Ours is a moment of historic
opportunity to create a safer, more prosperous tomorrow--to make a difference in the lives of our
citizens.

This promising state of affairs did not just happen, and there is no guarantee that it will endure. The
contemporary era was forged by steadfast American leadership over the last half century--through efforts
such as the Marshall Plan, NATO, the United Nations and the World Bank. The clear dangers of the past
made the need for national security commitments and expenditures obvious to the American people.
Today, the task of mobilizing public support for national security priorities is more complicated. The
complex array of unique dangers, opportunities and responsibilities outlined in this strategy are not
always readily apparent as we go about our daily lives, focused on immediate concerns. Yet, in a more
integrated and interdependent world, we must remain actively engaged in world affairs to successfully
advance our diplomatic, military and economic interests. To be secure and prosperous, America must
continue to lead.

Our international leadership focuses on six strategic priorities. Taken together, these priorities form the
roadmap to security, peace and prosperity into the next century:

e Foster a peaceful, undivided, democratic Europe

e Forge a strong and stable Asia Pacific community

Build a new, open trading system for the twenty-first century one that benefits America and the
world

e Keep America the world's leading force for peace

e Increase cooperation in confronting security threats that disregard national borders

e Strengthen the diplomatic and military tools required to address these challenges
Our engagement abroad requires the active, sustained support of the American people and the bipartisan
support of the U.S. Congress. This Administration remains committed to explaining our security
interests, objectives and priorities to the nation; to seeking the broadest possible public and

congressional support for our security programs and investments; and to exerting our leadership in the
world in a manner that reflects our best national values and protects the security of this great nation.

Preface

As we approach the beginning of the 21° century, the
United States remains the world’s most powerful
force for peace, prosperity and the universal values
of democracy and freedom. Our nation’s challenge—
and our responsibility—is to sustain that role by
harnessing the forces of global integration for the
benefit of our own people and people around the
world.

These forces of integration offer us an unprece-
dented opportunity to build new bonds among
individuals and nations, to tap the world’s vast human
potential in support of shared aspirations, and to
create a brighter future for our children. But they also
present new, complex challenges. The same forces
that bring us closer increase our interdependence,
and make us more vulnerable to forces like extreme
nationalism, terrorism, crime, environmental damage
and the complex flows of trade and investment that
know no borders.

To seize these opportunities, and move against the
threats of this new global era, we are pursuing a
forward-looking national security strategy attuned to
the realities of our new era. This report, submitted in
accordance with Section 603 of the Goldwater-
Nichols Defense Department Reorganization Act of
1986, sets forth that strategy. Its three core
objectives are:

* To enhance our security.
* To bolster America’s economic prosperity.
* To promote democracy abroad.

Over the past five years, we have been putting this
strategy in place through a network of institutions and
arrangements with distinct missions, but a common
purpose—to secure and strengthen the gains of
democracy and free markets while turning back their
enemies. Through this web of institutions and
arrangements, the United States and its partners in

 

the international community are laying a foundation
for security and prosperity in the 21st century.

This strategy encompasses a wide range of
initiatives: expanded military alliances like NATO, its
Partnership for Peace, and its partnerships with
Russia and Ukraine; promoting free trade through the
World Trade Organization and the move toward free
trade areas by nations in the Americas and
elsewhere around the world; strong arms control
regimes like the Chemical Weapons Convention and
the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty;
multinational coalitions combating terrorism,
corruption, crime and drug trafficking; and binding
international commitments to protect the environment
and safeguard human rights.

The United States must have the tools necessary to
carry out this strategy. We have worked diligently
within the parameters of the Balanced Budget
Agreement to preserve and provide for the readiness
of our armed forces while meeting priority military
challenges identified in the 1997 Quadrennial
Defense Review (QDR). The QDR struck a careful
balance between near-term readiness, long-term
modernization and quality of life improvements for
our men and women in uniform. It ensured that the
high readiness levels of our forward-deployed and
“first-to-fight"" forces would be maintained. The
priority we attach to maintaining a high-quality force
is reflected in our budget actions. This fiscal year,
with Congress’ support for the Bosnia and Southwest
Asia non-offset emergency supplemental funds, we
were able to protect our high payoff readiness
accounts. Next year's Defense Budget increases
funding for readiness and preserves quality of life for
military personnel.

Although we have accomplished much on the
readiness front, much more needs to be done. Our
military leadership and | are constantly reevaluating
the readiness of our forces and addressing problems
in individual readiness areas as they arise. | have

instructed the Office of Management and Budget and
the National Security Council to work with the
Department of Defense to formulate a multi-year plan
with the necessary resources to preserve military
readiness, support our troops, and modernize the
equipment needed for the next century. | am
confident that our military is—and will continue to
be—capable of carrying out our national strategy and
meeting America's defense commitments around the
world.

We must also renew our commitment to America’s
diplomacy—to ensure that we have the superb
diplomatic representation that our people deserve and
our interests demand. Every dollar we devote to
preventing conflicts, promoting democracy, and
stopping the spread of disease and starvation brings a
sure return in security and savings. Yet international
affairs spending today totals just one percent of the
federal budget—a small fraction of what America
invested at the start of the Cold War when we chose
engagement over isolation. If America is to continue
to lead the world by its own example, we must
demonstrate our own commitment to these priority
tasks. This is also why we must pay our dues to the
United Nations.

Protecting our citizens and critical infrastructures at
home is an essential element of our strategy.
Potential adversaries—whether nations, terrorist
groups or criminal organizations—will be tempted to
disrupt our critical infrastructures, impede
government operations, use weapons of mass
destruction against civilians, and prey on our citizens
overseas. These challenges demand close
cooperation across all levels of government—federal,
state and local—and across a wide range of
agencies, including the Departments of Defense and
State, the Intelligence Community, law enforcement,
emergency services, medical care providers and
others. Protecting our critical infrastructure requires
new partnerships between government and industry.
Forging these new structures will be challenging, but

 

must be done if we are to ensure our safety at home
and avoid vulnerabilities that those wishing us ill
might try to exploit in order to erode our resolve to
protect our interests abroad.

The United States has profound interests at stake in
the health of the global economy. Our future
prosperity depends upon a stable international
financial system and robust global growth. Economic
stability and growth are essential for the spread of
free markets and their integration into the global
economy. The forces necessary for a healthy global
economy are also those that deepen democratic
liberties: the free flow of ideas and information, open
borders and easy travel, the rule of law, fair and
even-handed enforcement, protection for consumers,
a skilled and educated work force. If citizens tire of
waiting for democracy and free markets to deliver a
better life for them, there is a real risk that they will
lose confidence in democracy and free markets. This
would pose great risks not only for our economic
interests but for our national security.

We are taking a number of steps to help contain the
current financial turmoil in Asia and other parts of the
world. We are working with other industrialized
nations, the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank to spur growth, stop the financial crisis
from spreading, and help the victims of financial
turmoil. We have also intensified our efforts to reform
international trade and financial institutions: building a
stronger and more accountable global trading
system, pressing forward with market-opening
initiatives, advancing the protection of labor and the
environment and doing more to ensure that trade
helps the lives of ordinary citizens across the globe.

At this moment in history, the United States is called
upon to lead—to organize the forces of freedom and
progress; to channel the unruly energies of the global
economy into positive avenues; and to advance our
prosperity, reinforce our democratic ideals and
values, and enhance our security.

|. Introduction

We must judge our national security strategy by its
success in meeting the fundamental purposes set out
in the preamble to the Constitution:

...provide for the common defence, promote the
general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of
Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,...

Since the founding of the nation, certain requirements
have remained constant. We must protect the lives
and personal safety of Americans, both at home and
abroad. We must maintain the sovereignty, political
freedom and independence of the United States, with
its values, institutions and territory intact. And, we
must promote for the well being and prosperity of the
nation and its people.

Challenges and Opportunities

The security environment in which we live is dynamic
and uncertain, replete with a host of threats and
challenges that have the potential to grow more
deadly, but also offering unprecedented opportunities
to avert those threats and advance our interests.

Globalization—the process of accelerating economic,
technological, cultural and political integration—
means that more and more we as a nation are
affected by events beyond our borders. Outlaw
states and ethnic conflicts threaten regional stability
and economic progress in many important areas of
the world. Weapons of mass destruction (WMD),
terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime are
global concerns that transcend national borders.
Other problems that once seemed quite distant—
such as resource depletion, rapid population growth,
environmental damage, new infectious diseases and
uncontrolled refugee migration—have important
implications for American security. Our workers and
businesses will suffer if foreign markets collapse or
lock us out, and the highest domestic environmental
standards will not protect us if we cannot get others
to achieve similar standards. In short, our citizens

 

have a direct stake in the prosperity and stability of
other nations, in their support for international norms
and human rights, in their ability to combat interna-
tional crime, in their open markets, and in their efforts
to protect the environment.

Yet, this is also a period of great promise. Globaliza-
tion is bringing citizens from all continents closer
together, allowing them to share ideas, goods and
information at the tap of a keyboard. Many nations
around the world have embraced America’s core
values of representative governance, free market
economics and respect for fundamental human rights
and the rule of law, creating new opportunities to
promote peace, prosperity and greater cooperation
among nations. Former adversaries now cooperate
with us. The dynamism of the global economy is
transforming commerce, culture, communications
and global relations, creating new jobs and economic
opportunity for millions of Americans.

The Imperative of Engagement

Our strategic approach recognizes that we must lead
abroad if we are to be secure at home, but we cannot
lead abroad unless we are strong at home. We must
be prepared and willing to use all appropriate
instruments of national power to influence the actions
of other states and non-state actors. Today's
complex security environment demands that all our
instruments of national power be effectively
integrated to achieve our security objectives. We
must have the demonstrated will and capabilities to
continue to exert global leadership and remain the
preferred security partner for the community of states
that share our interests. We have seen in the past
that the international community is often reluctant to
act forcefully without American leadership. In many
instances, the United States is the only nation
capable of providing the necessary leadership and
capabilities for an international response to shared
challenges. American leadership and engagement

in the world are vital for our security, and our nation
and the world are safer and more prosperous as a
result.

The alternative to engagement is not withdrawal from
the world; it is passive submission to powerful forces
of change—all the more ironic at a time when our
capacity to shape them is as great as it has ever
been. Three-quarters of a century ago, the United
States helped to squander Allied victory in World War
| by embracing isolationism. After World War II, and
in the face of a new totalitarian threat, America
accepted the challenge to lead. We remained
engaged overseas and worked with our allies to
create international structures—from the Marshall
Plan, the United Nations, NATO and other defense
arrangements, to the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank—that enabled us to strengthen
our security and prosperity and win the Cold War. By
exerting our leadership abroad we have deterred
aggression, fostered the resolution of conflicts,
strengthened democracies, opened foreign markets
and tackled global problems such as protecting the
environment. U.S. leadership has been crucial to the
success of negotiations that produced a wide range
of treaties that have made the world safer and more
secure by limiting, reducing, preventing the spread of,
or eliminating weapons of mass destruction and other
dangerous weapons. Without our leadership and
engagement, threats would multiply and our
opportunities would narrow.

Underpinning our international leadership is the
power of our democratic ideals and values. In
designing our strategy, we recognize that the spread
of democracy supports American values and
enhances both our security and prosperity.
Democratic governments are more likely to cooperate
with each other against common threats, encourage
free trade, and promote sustainable economic
development. They are less likely to wage war or
abuse the rights of their people. Hence, the trend
toward democracy and free markets throughout the
world advances American interests. The United
States will support this trend by remaining actively
engaged in the world. This is the strategy to take us
into the next century.

Implementing the Strategy

Our global leadership efforts will continue to be
guided by President Clinton's strategic priorities: to

 

foster regional efforts led by the community of
democratic nations to promote peace and prosperity
in key regions of the world, to increase cooperation in
confronting new security threats that defy borders
and unilateral solutions, to strengthen the military,
diplomatic and law enforcement tools necessary to
meet these challenges and to create more jobs and
opportunities for Americans through a more open and
competitive economic system that also benefits
others around the world. Our strategy is tempered by
recognition that there are limits to America’s
involvement in the world. We must be selective in
the use of our capabilities and the choices we make
always must be guided by advancing our objectives
of a more secure, prosperous and free America.

We must always be prepared to act alone when that
is our most advantageous course. But many of our
security objectives are best achieved—or can only be
achieved—through our alliances and other formal
security structures, or as a leader of an ad hoc
coalition formed around a specific objective. Durable
relationships with allies and friendly nations are vital
to our security. A central thrust of our strategy is to
strengthen and adapt the security relationships we
have with key nations around the world and create
new relationships and structures when necessary.
Examples include NATO enlargement, the
Partnership for Peace, the NATO-Russia Permanent
Joint Council, the African Crisis Response Initiative,
the regional security dialogue in the ASEAN Regional
Forum and the hemispheric security initiatives
adopted at the Summit of the Americas. At other
times we harness our diplomatic, economic, military
and information strengths to shape a favorable
international environment outside of formal
structures. This approach has borne fruit in areas as
diverse as the elimination of nuclear weapons from
Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus, our
comprehensive assistance package for Russia and
other Newly Independent States (NIS), the
advancement of peace in Northern Ireland, and
support for the transformation of South Africa.

Protecting our citizens and critical infrastructures at
home is an intrinsic and essential element of our
security strategy. The dividing line between domestic
and foreign policy is increasingly blurred. Globaliza-
tion enables other states, terrorists, criminals, drug
traffickers and others to challenge the safety of our
citizens and the security of our borders in new ways.
The security challenges wrought by globalization
demand close cooperation across all levels of

government—federal, state and local—and across a
wide range of agencies, including the Departments of
Defense and State, the Intelligence Community, law
enforcement, emergency services, medical care
providers and others. Protecting our critical infra-
structure requires new partnerships between govern-
ment and industry. Forging these new structures and
relationships will be challenging, but must be done if
we are to ensure our safety at home and avoid
vulnerabilities that those wishing us ill might try to
exploit in order to erode our resolve to protect our
interests abroad.

Engagement abroad rightly depends on the willing-
ness of the American people and the Congress to
bear the costs of defending U.S. interests—in dollars,
energy and, when there is no alternative, the risk of
losing American lives. We must, therefore, foster the
broad public understanding and bipartisan
congressional support necessary to sustain our
international engagement, always recognizing that
some decisions that face popular opposition must
ultimately be judged by whether they advance the
interests of the American people in the long run.

Il. Advancing U.S. National Interests

The goal of the national security strategy is to ensure
the protection of our nation’s fundamental and
enduring needs: protect the lives and safety of
Americans, maintain the sovereignty of the United
States with its values, institutions and territory intact,
and promote the prosperity and well-being of the
nation and its people. In our vision of the world, the
United States has close cooperative relations with the
world’s most influential countries and has the ability to
influence the policies and actions of those who can
affect our national well-being.

We seek to create a stable, peaceful international
security environment in which our nation, citizens and
interests are not threatened. The United States will
not allow a hostile power to dominate any region of
critical importance to our interests. We will work to
prevent the spread of nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons and the materials for producing
them, and to control other potentially destabilizing
technologies, such as long-range missiles. We will
continue to ensure that we have effective means for
countering and responding to the threats we cannot
deter or otherwise prevent from arising. This includes
protecting our citizens from terrorism, international
crime and drug trafficking.

We seek a world in which democratic values and
respect for human rights and the rule of law are
increasingly accepted. This will be achieved through
broadening the community of free-market
democracies, promoting an international community
that is willing and able to prevent or respond
effectively to humanitarian problems, and
strengthening international non-governmental
movements committed to human rights and
democratization. These efforts help prevent
humanitarian disasters, promote reconciliation in
states experiencing civil conflict and address migration
and refugee crises.

We seek continued American prosperity through
increasingly open international trade and sustainable
growth in the global economy. The health of the

 

international economy directly affects our security,
just as stability enhances the prospects for prosperity.
Prosperity ensures that we are able to sustain our
military forces, foreign initiatives and global influence.
In turn, our engagement and influence helps ensure
that the world remains stable so the international
economic system can flourish.

We seek a cleaner global environment to protect the
health and well-being of our citizens. A deteriorating
environment not only threatens public health, it
impedes economic growth and can generate tensions
that threaten international stability. To the extent that
other nations believe they must engage in non-
sustainable exploitation of natural resources, our
long-term prosperity and security are at risk.

Since there are always many demands for U.S.
action, our national interests must be clear. These
interests fall into three categories. The first includes
vital interests—those of broad, overriding impor-
tance to the survival, safety and vitality of our nation.
Among these are the physical security of our territory
and that of our allies, the safety of our citizens, our
economic well-being and the protection of our critical
infrastructures. We will do what we must to defend
these interests, including—when necessary—using
our military might unilaterally and decisively.

The second category includes situations in which
important national interests are at stake. These
interests do not affect our national survival, but they
do affect our national well-being and the character of
the world in which we live. In such cases, we will use
our resources to advance these interests insofar as
the costs and risks are commensurate with the
interests at stake. Our efforts to halt the flow of
refugees from Haiti and restore democracy in that
state, our participation in NATO operations in Bosnia
and our efforts to protect the global environment are
relevant examples.

The third category is humanitarian and other
interests. In some circumstances our nation may act
because our values demand it. Examples include

responding to natural and manmade disasters or
violations of human rights, supporting democratiza-
tion and civil control of the military, assisting
humanitarian demining, and promoting sustainable
development. Often in such cases, the force of our
example bolsters support for our leadership in the
world. Whenever possible, we seek to avert
humanitarian disasters and conflict through diplomacy
and cooperation with a wide range of partners,
including other governments, international institutions
and non-governmental organizations. This may not
only save lives, but also prevent the drain on
resources Caused by intervention in crises.

Our strategy is based on three national objectives:
enhancing our security, bolstering our economic
prosperity and promoting democracy abroad.

Enhancing Security at
Home and Abroad

Our strategy for enhancing U.S. security recognizes
that we face diverse threats requiring integrated
approaches to defend the nation, shape the
international environment, respond to crises and
prepare for an uncertain future.

Threats to U.S. Interests

The current international security environment
presents a diverse set of threats to our enduring
goals and hence to our security:

¢ Regional or State-Centered Threats: A number
of states still have the capabilities and the desire
to threaten our vital interests through coercion or
aggression. They continue to threaten the
sovereignty of their neighbors and international
access to resources. In many cases, these
states are also actively improving their offensive
capabilities, including efforts to obtain or retain
nuclear, biological or chemical weapons and, in
some cases, long-range delivery systems. In
Southwest Asia, both Iraq and Iran have the
potential to threaten their neighbors and the free
flow of oil from the region. In East Asia, North
Korea maintains its forward positioning of
offensive military capabilities on its border with
South Korea.

 

Transnational threats: Terrorism, international
crime, drug trafficking, illicit arms trafficking,
uncontrolled refugee migrations and
environmental damage threaten U.S. interests,
citizens and the U.S. homeland itself. The
possibility of terrorists and other criminals using
WMD—nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons—is of special concern. Threats to the
national information infrastructure, ranging from
cyber-crime to a strategic information attack on
the United States via the global information
network, present a dangerous new threat to our
national security. We must also guard against
threats to our other critical national
infrastructures—such as electrical power and
transportation—which increasingly could take the
form of a cyber-attack in addition to physical
attack or sabotage, and could originate from
terrorist or criminal groups as well as hostile
states. International drug trafficking organizations
have become the most powerful and dangerous
organized crime groups the United States has
ever confronted due to their sophisticated
production, shipment, distribution and financial
systems, and the violence and corruption they
promote everywhere they operate.

Spread of dangerous technologies: Weapons
of mass destruction pose the greatest potential
threat to global stability and security. Proliferation
of advanced weapons and technologies threatens
to provide rogue states, terrorists and
international crime organizations the means to
inflict terrible damage on the United States, its
allies and U.S. citizens and troops abroad. We
must continue to deter and be prepared to
counter the use or threatened use of WMD,
reduce the threat posed by existing arsenals of
such weaponry and halt the smuggling of nuclear
materials. We must identify the technical
information, technologies and materials that
cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of those
seeking to develop and produce WMD. And we
must stop the proliferation of

non-safeguarded dual-use technologies that
place these destructive capabilities in the hands
of parties hostile to U.S. and global security
interests.

Foreign intelligence collection: The threat
from foreign intelligence services is more diverse,
complex and difficult to counter than ever before.

This threat is a mix of traditional and non-
traditional intelligence adversaries that have
targeted American military, diplomatic,
technological and commercial secrets. Some
foreign intelligence services are rapidly adopting
new technologies and innovative methods to
obtain such secrets, including attempts to use the
global information infrastructure to gain access to
sensitive information via penetration of computer
systems and networks. These new methods
compound the already serious threat posed by
traditional human, technical and signals
intelligence activities.

¢ Failed states: We can expect that, despite
international prevention efforts, some states will
be unable to provide basic governance, services
and opportunities for their populations, potentially
generating internal conflict, humanitarian crises
or regional instability. As governments lose their
ability to provide for the welfare of their citizens,
mass migration, civil unrest, famine, mass
killings, environmental disasters and aggression
against neighboring states or ethnic groups can
threaten U.S. interests and citizens.

The Need for Integrated
Approaches

Success in countering these varied threats requires
an integrated approach that brings to bear all the
capabilities and assets needed to achieve our
security objectives—particularly in this era when
domestic and foreign policies are increasingly blurred.

To effectively shape the international environment
and respond to the full spectrum of potential threats
and crises, diplomacy, military force, our other foreign
policy tools and our domestic preparedness efforts
must be closely coordinated. We must retain a
strong foreign assistance program and an effective
diplomatic corps if we are to maintain American
leadership. We must maintain superior military forces
at the level of readiness necessary to effectively deter
aggression, conduct a wide range of peacetime
activities and smaller-scale contingencies, and,
preferably in concert with regional friends and allies,
win two overlapping major theater wars. The success
of all our foreign policy tools is critically dependent on
timely and effective intelligence collection and
analysis capabilities.

 

International cooperation will be vital for building
security in the next century because many of the
threats we face cannot be addressed by a single
nation. Globalization of transportation and
communications has allowed international terrorists
and criminals to operate without geographic
constraints, while individual governments and their
law enforcement agencies remain limited by national
boundaries. Unlike terrorists and criminals, govern-
ments must respect the sovereignty of other nations.
Accordingly, a central thrust of our strategy is to
enhance relationships with key nations around the
world to combat transnational threats to common
interests. We seek to address these threats by
increasing intelligence and law enforcement coopera-
tion, denying terrorists safe havens, preventing arms
traders from fueling regional conflicts and subverting
international embargoes, and cracking down on drug
trafficking, money laundering and international crime.

Building effective coalitions of like-minded nations is
not enough. We are continuing to strengthen and
integrate our own diplomatic, military, intelligence and
law enforcement capabilities so we can act on our
own when we must as well as more effectively lead
the international community in responding to these
threats.

Potential enemies, whether nations, terrorist groups
or criminal organizations, are increasingly likely to
attack U.S. territory and the American people in
unconventional ways. Adversaries will be tempted to
disrupt our critical infrastructures, impede continuity
of government operations, use weapons of mass
destruction against civilians in our cities, attack us
when we gather at special events and prey on our
citizens overseas. The United States must act to
deter or prevent such attacks and, if attacks occurs
despite those efforts, must be prepared to limit the
damage they cause and respond decisively against
the perpetrators. We will spare no effort to bring
attackers to justice, ever adhering to our policy toward
terrorists that ""You can run, but you cannot hide,"" and
where appropriate to defend ourselves by striking at
terrorist bases and states that support terrorist acts.

At home, we must have effective capabilities for
thwarting and responding to terrorist acts, countering
international crime and foreign intelligence collection,
and protecting critical national infrastructures. Our
efforts to counter these threats cannot be limited
exclusively to any one agency within the U.S.

Government. The threats and their consequences
cross agency lines, requiring close cooperation
among Federal agencies, state and local govern-
ments, the industries that own and operate critical
national infrastructures, non-governmental
organizations and others in the private sector.

Shaping the International
Environment

The United States has a range of tools at its disposal
with which to shape the international environment in
ways favorable to U.S. interests and global security.
Shaping activities enhance U.S. security by promoting
regional security and preventing or reducing the wide
range of diverse threats outlined above. These
measures adapt and strengthen alliances and
friendships, maintain U.S. influence in key regions
and encourage adherence to international norms.
When signs of potential conflict emerge, or potential
threats appear, we undertake initiatives to prevent or
reduce these threats. Our shaping efforts also aim to
discourage arms races, halt the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, reduce tensions in
critical regions and combat the spread of international
criminal organizations.

Many of our international shaping activities, often
undertaken with the cooperation of our allies and
friends, also help to prevent threats from arising that
place at risk American lives and property at home.
Examples include countering terrorism, drug and
firearms trafficking, illegal immigration, the spread of
WMD and other threats. Increasingly, shaping the
security environment involves a wide range of Federal
agencies, some of which in the past have not been
thought of as having such an international role.

Diplomacy

Diplomacy is a vital tool for countering threats to our
national security. The daily business of diplomacy
conducted through our missions and representatives
around the world is a irreplaceable shaping activity.
These efforts are essential to sustaining our alliances,
forcefully articulating U.S. interests, resolving regional
disputes peacefully, averting humanitarian
catastrophe, deterring aggression against the United
States and our friends and allies, creating trade and

 

investment opportunities for U.S. companies, and
projecting U.S. influence worldwide.

One of the lessons that has been repeatedly driven
home is the importance of preventive diplomacy in
dealing with conflict and complex emergencies.
Helping prevent nations from failing is far more
effective than rebuilding them after an internal crisis.
Helping people stay in their homes is far more
beneficial than feeding and housing them in refugee
camps. Helping relief agencies and international
organizations strengthen the institutions of conflict
resolution is far less taxing than healing ethnic and
social divisions that have already exploded into
bloodshed. In short, while crisis management and
crisis resolution are necessary tasks for our foreign
policy, preventive diplomacy is obviously far
preferable.

Credible military force and the demonstrated will to
use it are essential to defend our vital interests and
keep America safe. But force alone cannot solve all
our problems. To be most effective, force, diplomacy
and our other policy tools must complement and
reinforce each other—for there will be many
occasions and many places where we must rely on
diplomatic shaping activities to protect and advance
our interests.

International Assistance

From the U.S.-led mobilization to rebuild post-war
Europe to the more recent creation of export
opportunities across Asia, Latin America and Africa,
U.S. foreign assistance has assisted emerging
democracies, helped expand free markets, slowed
the growth of international crime, contained major
health threats, improved protection of the
environment and natural resources, slowed
population growth and defused humanitarian crises.
Crises are averted—and U.S. preventive diplomacy
actively reinforced—through U.S. sustainable
development programs that promote voluntary family
planning, basic education, environmental protection,
democratic governance and rule of law, and the
economic empowerment of private citizens.

When combined effectively with other bilateral and
multilateral activities, such as through our cooperative
scientific and technological programs, U.S. initiatives
reduce the need for costly military and humanitarian
interventions. Where foreign aid succeeds in

consolidating free market policies, substantial growth
of American exports has frequently followed. Where
crises have occurred, actions such as the Greater
Horn of Africa Initiative have helped stanch mass
human suffering and created a path out of conflict
and dislocation through targeted relief. Other foreign
aid programs have worked to help restore elementary
security and civic institutions.

Arms Control

Arms control efforts are an essential element of our
national security strategy. Effective arms control is
really defense by other means. We pursue verifiable
arms control agreements that support our efforts to
prevent the spread and use of weapons of mass
destruction, halt the use of conventional weapons that
cause unnecessary suffering, and contribute to
regional stability at lower levels of armaments. By
increasing transparency in the size, structure and
operations of military forces, arms control
agreements and confidence-building measures
reduce incentives and opportunities to initiate an
attack, and reduce the mutual suspicions that arise
from and spur on armaments competition. They help
provide the assurance of security necessary to
strengthen cooperative relationships and direct
resources to safer, more productive endeavors.
Agreements that preserve our crisis response
capability shape the global and regional security
environments, and simultaneously reinforce our
commitment to allies and partners. Our arms control
initiatives are an essential prevention measure for
enhancing U.S. and allied security.

Verifiable reductions in strategic offensive arms and
the steady shift toward less destabilizing systems
remain essential to our strategy. Entry into force of
the START | Treaty in December 1994 charted the
course for reductions in the deployed strategic
nuclear forces of the United States and the Former
Soviet Union (FSU). START I has accomplished
much to reduce the risk of nuclear war and strength-
en international security. On the third anniversary of
START | entry into force, the United States and
Russia announced that both were two years ahead of
schedule in meeting the treaty’s mandated
reductions.

Once the START II Treaty enters into force, the
United States and Russia will each be limited to
between 3,000-3,500 total deployed strategic nuclear

 

warheads. START II also will eliminate destabilizing
land-based multiple warhead missiles, a truly historic
achievement. Russian ratification of START II will
open the door to the next round of strategic arms
control.

At the Helsinki Summit in March 1997, Presidents
Clinton and Yeltsin agreed that once START II enters
into force, our two nations would immediately begin
negotiations on a START Ill agreement. They agreed
to START III guidelines that, if adopted, will cap the
number of strategic nuclear warheads deployed in
each country at 2,000-2,500 by the end of 2007—
reducing both our arsenals by 80 percent from Cold
War heights. They also agreed that START III will,
for the first time, require the U.S. and Russia to
destroy nuclear warheads, not just the missiles,
aircraft and submarines that carry them, and opened
the door to possible reductions in non-strategic
nuclear weapons. On September 26, 1997, the U.S.
and Russia signed a START II Protocol codifying the
agreement at Helsinki to extend the end date for
reductions to 2007 and exchanged letters on early
deactivation by 2003 of those strategic nuclear
delivery systems to be eliminated by 2007.

At Helsinki, the two Presidents recognized the Nunn-
Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program
as the vehicle through which the United States would
facilitate the deactivation of strategic nuclear delivery
systems in the FSU nations. The CTR Program has
assisted Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus in
becoming non-nuclear weapons states and will
continue to assist Russia in meeting its START
obligations. The program has effectively supported
enhanced safety, security, accounting and centralized
control measures for nuclear weapons and fissile
materials in the FSU. CTR is also assisting FSU
nations in measures to eliminate and prevent the
proliferation of chemical weapons and biological
weapon-related capabilities. It has supported many
ongoing military reductions and reform measures in
the FSU, and has contributed to a climate conducive
for further progress on non-proliferation.

Also at Helsinki, the Presidents reaffirmed their
commitment to the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty
and recognized the need for effective theater missile
defenses in an agreement in principle on demarcation
between systems to counter strategic ballistic
missiles and those to counter theater ballistic
missiles. On September 26, 1997, the U.S. Secretary
of State and Russian Foreign Minister, along with

their counterparts from Belarus, Kazakhstan and
Ukraine, signed or initialed five agreements relating to
the ABM Treaty. The agreements on demarcation
and succession will be provided to the Senate for its
advice and consent following Russian ratification of
START Il.

By banning all nuclear test explosions for all time, the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) constrains
the development of dangerous nuclear weapons,
contributes to preventing nuclear proliferation and to
the process of nuclear disarmament, and enhances
the ability of the United States to monitor suspicious
nuclear activities in other countries through a
worldwide sensor network and on-site inspections.
Nuclear tests in India and Pakistan in May 1998 make
it more important than ever to move quickly to bring
the CTBT into force and continue establishment of
the substantial verification mechanisms called for in
the treaty. The President has submitted the treaty,
which 150 nations have signed, to the Senate and
has urged the Senate to provide its advice and
consent this year. Prompt U.S. ratification will
encourage other states to ratify, enable the United
States to lead the international effort to gain CTBT
entry into force and strengthen international norms
against nuclear testing. Multilateral and regional
arms control efforts also increase U.S. and global
security. We seek to strengthen the Biological
Weapons Convention (BWC) with a new international
regime to ensure compliance. At present, we are
negotiating with other BWC member states in an
effort to reach consensus on a protocol to the BWC
that would implement an inspection system to deter
and detect cheating. We are also working hard to
implement and enforce the Chemical Weapons
Convention (CWC). The United States Senate
underscored the importance of these efforts with its
April 24, 1997 decision, by a vote of 74-26, to give its
advice and consent to ratification of the CWC. The
next key step is legislation to implement full
compliance with the commercial declarations and
inspections that are required by the CWC.

In Europe, we are pursuing the adaptation of the 1990
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty,
consistent with the Decision on Certain Basic
Elements adopted in Vienna on July 23, 1997 by all
30 CFE states. Success in this negotiation will
ensure that this landmark agreement remains a
cornerstone of European security into the 21* century
and beyond. We continue to seek Russian, Ukrainian
and Belarusian ratification of the 1992 Open Skies

10

 

Treaty to increase transparency of military forces in
Eurasia and North America. We also promote,
through international organizations such as the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), implementation of confidence and security-
building measures, including the 1994 Vienna
Document, throughout Europe and in specific regions
of tension and instability—even where we are not
formal parties to such agreements. The agreements
mandated by the Dayton Accords demonstrate how
innovative regional efforts can strengthen stability and
reduce conflicts that could adversely affect U.S.
interests abroad.

President Clinton is committed to ending the tragic
damage to innocent civilians due to anti-personnel
landmines (APLs). The United States has already
taken major steps in the spirit that motivated the
Ottawa Convention, while ensuring our ability to meet
international obligations and provide for the safety
and security of our men and women in uniform. On
June 30, 1998, we met—one year ahead of
schedule—the President's May 1996 commitment to
destroy all of our non-self-destructing APLs by 1999,
except those we need for Korea and demining
training. To expand and strengthen the
Administration policy on APLs that he announced on
September 17, 1997, President Clinton signed
Presidential Decision Directive 64 in June 1998. It
directs the Defense Department to end the use of all
APLs, even of self-destructing APLs, outside Korea
by 2003 and to pursue aggressively the objective of
having APL alternatives ready for Korea by 2006. We
will also aggressively pursue alternatives to our mixed
anti-tank systems that contain anti-personnel
submunitions. We have made clear that the United
States will sign the Ottawa Convention by 2006 if we
succeed in identifying and fielding suitable
alternatives to our self-destructing APLs and mixed
anti-tank systems by then. Furthermore, in 1997 the
Administration submitted for Senate advice and
consent the Amended Landmine Protocol to the
Convention on Conventional Weapons, which bans
the unmarked, long-duration APLs that caused the
worldwide humanitarian problem. We have
established a permanent ban on APL exports and are
seeking to universalize an export ban through the
Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. In 1998 we
are spending $80 million on humanitarian demining
programs, more than double that of the previous year,
and through our ""Demining 2010"" initiative have
challenged the world to increase the effectiveness

and efficiency of removing landmines that threaten
civilians.

Nonproliferation Initiatives

Nonproliferation initiatives enhance global security by
preventing the spread of WMD, materials for
producing them and means of delivering them. That
is why the Administration is promoting universal
adherence to the international treaty regimes that
prohibit the acquisition of weapons of mass
destruction, including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT), the CWC and the BWC. The NPT was
an indispensable precondition for the denuclearization
of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus and South Africa.
We also seek to strengthen the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards system and
achieve a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty to cap the
nuclear materials available for weapons. A
coordinated effort by the intelligence community and
law enforcement agencies to detect, prevent and
deter illegal trafficking in fissile materials is also
essential to our counter-proliferation efforts.

The Administration also seeks to prevent destabiliz-
ing buildups of conventional arms and limit access to
sensitive technical information, equipment and
technologies by strengthening multilateral regimes,
including the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export
Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods
and Technologies, the Australia Group (for chemical
and biological weapons), the Missile Technology
Control Regime (MTCR) and the Nuclear Suppliers
Group. We are working to harmonize national export
control policies, increase information sharing, refine
control lists and expand cooperation against illicit
transfers.

Regional nonproliferation efforts are particularly
important in three critical proliferation zones. On the
Korean Peninsula, we are implementing the 1994
Agreed Framework, which requires full compliance by
North Korea with nonproliferation obligations. In the
Middle East and Southwest Asia, we encourage
regional arms control agreements that address the
legitimate security concerns of all parties and
continue efforts to thwart and roll back Iran’s
development of weapons of mass destruction and
lraq’s efforts to reconstitute its programs. In South
Asia, we seek to persuade India and Pakistan to bring
their nuclear and missile programs into conformity
with international nonproliferation standards and to
sign and ratify the CTBT.

 

Through programs such as the Nunn-Lugar
Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and other
initiatives, we aim to strengthen controls over
weapons-usable fissile material and prevent the theft
or diversion of WMD and related material and
technology. We are working to strengthen the
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear
Material to increase accountability and protection,
which complements our effort to enhance IAEA
safeguards. We are purchasing tons of highly
enriched uranium from dismantled Russian nuclear
weapons for conversion into commercial reactor fuel,
and working with Russia to redirect former Soviet
facilities and scientists from military to peaceful
purposes.

To expand and improve U.S. efforts aimed at
deterring proliferation of WMD by organized crime
groups and individuals in the NIS and Eastern
Europe, the Defense Department and FBI are

11

implementing a joint counter proliferation assistance
program that provides appropriate training, material
and services to law enforcement agencies in these
areas. The program’s objectives are to assist in
establishing a professional cadre of law enforcement
personnel in these nations trained to prevent, deter
and investigate crimes related to the proliferation and
diversion of WMD or their delivery systems; to assist
these countries in developing laws and regulations
designed to prevent the illicit acquisition or trafficking
of WMD, and in establishing appropriate enforcement
mechanisms; and to build a solid legal and
organization framework that will enable these
governments to attack the proliferation problem at
home and participate effectively in international
efforts.

Military Activities

The U.S. military plays an essential role in building
coalitions and shaping the international environment
in ways that protect and promote U.S. interests.
Through overseas presence and peacetime
engagement activities such as defense cooperation,
security assistance, and training and exercises with
allies and friends, our armed forces help to deter
aggression and coercion, promote regional stability,
prevent and reduce conflicts and threats, and serve
as role models for militaries in emerging
democracies. These important efforts engage every
component of the Total Force: Active, Reserve,
National Guard and civilian.

Deterrence of aggression and coercion on a daily
basis is crucial. Our ability to deter potential
adversaries in peacetime rests on several factors,
particularly on our demonstrated will and ability to
uphold our security commitments when they are
challenged. We have earned this reputation through
both our declaratory policy, which clearly
communicates costs to potential adversaries, and our
credible warfighting capability. This capability is
embodied in ready forces and equipment strategically
stationed or deployed forward, in forces in the United
States at the appropriate level of readiness to deploy
and go into action when needed, in our ability to gain
timely access to critical regions and infrastructure
overseas, and in our demonstrated ability to form and
lead effective military coalitions.

Our nuclear deterrent posture is one of the most
visible and important examples of how U.S. military

12

 

capabilities can be used effectively to deter
aggression and coercion, as reaffirmed ina
Presidential Decision Directive signed by President
Clinton in November 1997. Nuclear weapons serve
as a hedge against an uncertain future, a guarantee
of our security commitments to allies anda
disincentive to those who would contemplate
developing or otherwise acquiring their own nuclear
weapons. Our military planning for the possible
employment of U.S. nuclear weapons is focused on
deterring a nuclear war rather than attempting to fight
and win a protracted nuclear exchange. We continue
to emphasize the survivability of the nuclear systems
and infrastructure necessary to endure a preemptive
attack and still respond at overwhelming levels. The
United States must continue to maintain a robust triad
of strategic forces sufficient to deter any hostile
foreign leadership with access to nuclear forces and
to convince it that seeking a nuclear advantage would
be futile. We must also ensure the continued viability
of the infrastructure that supports U.S. nuclear forces
and weapons. The Stockpile Stewardship Program
will guarantee the safety and reliability of our nuclear
weapons under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

While our overall deterrence posture—nuclear and
conventional—has been effective against most
potential adversaries, a range of terrorist and criminal
organizations may not be deterred by traditional
deterrent threats. For these actors to be deterred,
they must believe that any type of attack against the
United States or its citizens will be attributed to them
and that we will respond effectively and decisively to
protect our national interests and ensure that justice
is done.

Our military promotes regional stability in numerous
ways. In Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia,
where the U.S. has clear, vital interests, the American
military helps assure the security of our allies and
friends. The reinforcement of U.S. forces in the Gulf
from Fall 1997 to Spring 1998 clearly illustrates the
importance of military power in achieving U.S.
national security objectives and stabilizing a
potentially volatile situation. The U.S. buildup made it
clear to Saddam Hussein that he must comply with
UN sanctions and cease hindering UNSCOM
inspections or face dire consequences. It

also denied him the option of moving to threaten his
neighbors, as he had done in past confrontations with
the international community. Saddam's agreement to
open the so-called ""presidential sites"" to UN
inspection was a significant step toward ensuring that
lraq's WMD have been eradicated. It would not have
been achieved without American diplomacy backed
by force. Our decision maintain a higher continuous
force level in the Gulf than we had before this most
recent confrontation with Iraq will help deter Saddam
from making further provocations and strengthen the
resolve of our coalition partners in the Gulf.

We are continuing to adapt and strengthen our
alliances and coalitions to meet the challenges of an
evolving security environment. U.S. military forces
prevent and reduce a wide range of potential conflicts
in key regions. An example of such an activity is our
deployment to the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia to help prevent the spread of violence to
that country. We assist other countries in improving
their pertinent military capabilities, including
peacekeeping and humanitarian response. With
countries that are neither staunch friends nor known
foes, military cooperation often serves as a positive
means of engagement, building security relationships
today that will contribute to improved relations
tomorrow.

Our armed forces also serve as a role model for
militaries in emerging democracies around the world.
Our 200-year history of strong civilian control of the
military serves as an example to those countries with
histories of non-democratic governments. Through
military-to-military activities and increasing links
between the U.S. military and the military
establishments of Partnership for Peace nations, for
instance, we are helping to transform military
institutions in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as
in the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet
Union.

International Law Enforcement
Cooperation

As threats to our national security from drug
trafficking, terrorism and international crime increase,
development of working relations U.S. and foreign
law enforcement and judicial agencies will play a vital
role in shaping law enforcement priorities in those
countries. Law enforcement agencies must continue

 

to find innovative ways to develop a concerted, global
attack on the spread of international crime.

Overseas law enforcement presence leverages
resources and fosters the establishment of effective
working relationships with foreign law enforcement
agencies. U.S. investigators and prosecutors draw
upon their experience and background to enlist the
cooperation of foreign law enforcement officials,
keeping crime away from American shores, enabling
the arrest of many U.S. fugitives and solving serious
U.S. crimes. This presence develops substantive
international links by creating personal networks of
law enforcement professionals dedicated to bringing
international criminals to justice.

In addition, training foreign law enforcement officers
is critical to combating international crime. Such
training helps create professional law enforcement
organizations and builds citizen confidence in law
enforcement officers, who understand and operate
under the rule of law. Training also builds a common
perspective and understanding of investigative
techniques that helps shape international law
enforcement priorities. The FBI and other federal law
enforcement agencies have provided extensive law
enforcement training at the International Law
Enforcement Academy in Budapest, Hungary and
elsewhere around the world. This training has proved
to be enormously effective in developing professional
law enforcement and security services in emerging
democracies.

Environmental Initiatives

Decisions today regarding the environment and
natural resources can affect our security for
generations. Environmental threats do not heed
national borders and can pose long-term dangers to
our security and well-being. Natural resource
scarcities can trigger and exacerbate conflict.
Environmental threats such as climate change, ozone
depletion and the transnational movement of
hazardous chemicals and waste directly threaten the
health of U.S. citizens.

We have a full diplomatic agenda, working bilaterally
and multilaterally to respond aggressively to
environmental threats. The Global Environmental
Facility (GEF) is an important instrument for this
cooperation. With 161 member nations, the GEF is
specifically focused on reducing cross-border
environmental damage. Our Environmental Security

13

Initiative joins U.S. agencies with foreign partners to
address regional environmental concerns and thereby
reduce the risk to U.S. interests abroad. We have
also undertaken development of an environmental
forecasting system to provide U.S. policymakers
advance warning of environmental stress situations
which have the potential for significant impact on U.S.
interests.

At Kyoto in December 1997, the industrialized nations
of the world agreed for the first time to binding limits
on greenhouse gases. The agreement is strong and
comprehensive, covering the six greenhouse gases
whose concentrations are increasing due to human
activity. It reflects the commitment of the United
States to use the tools of the free market to tackle
this problem. It will enhance growth and create new
incentives for the rapid development of technologies
through a system of joint implementation and
emissions trading. The Kyoto agreement was a vital
turning point, but we still have a lot of hard work
ahead. We must press for meaningful participation
by key developing nations. Multilateral negotiations
are underway and we will pursue bilateral talks with
key developing nations. We will not submit the Kyoto
agreement for ratifica-tion until key developing
nations have agreed to participate meaningfully in
efforts to address global warming.

Additionally, we seek to accomplish the following:

* achieve increased compliance with the Montreal
Protocol through domestic and multilateral efforts
aimed at curbing illegal trade in ozone depleting
substances;

* ratify the Law of the Sea Convention, implement
the UN Straddling Stocks Agreement and help to
promote sustainable management of fisheries
worldwide;

* implement the Program of Action on population
growth developed at the 1994 Cairo Conference,
lead a renewed global effort to address population
problems and promote international consensus for
stabilizing world population growth;

* expand bilateral forest assistance programs and
promote sustainable management of tropical
forests;

* achieve Senate ratification of the Convention to
Combat Desertification;

14

 

* negotiate an international agreement to ban
twelve persistent organic pollutants, including
such hazardous chemicals as DDT;

* promote environment-related scientific research
in other countries so they can better identify
environmental problems and develop indigenous
solutions for them;

* increase international cooperation in fighting
transboundary environmental crime, including
trafficking in protected flora and fauna, hazard-
ous waste and ozone-depleting chemicals;

* ratify the Biodiversity Convention and take steps
to prevent biodiversity loss, including support for
agricultural research to relieve pressures on
forests, working with multilateral development
banks and others to prevent biodiversity loss in
key regions, and use of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species to
protect threatened species; and

* continue to work with the Nordic countries and
Russia to mitigate nuclear and non-nuclear
pollution in the Arctic, and continue to encourage
Russia to develop sound management practices
for nuclear materials and radioactive waste.

Responding to Threats and
Crises

Because our shaping efforts alone cannot guarantee
the international security environment we seek, the
United States must be able to respond at home and
abroad to the full spectrum of threats and crises that
may arise. Our resources are finite, so we must be
selective in our responses, focusing on challenges
that most directly affect our interests and engaging
where we can make the most difference. Our
response might be diplomatic, economic, law
enforcement, or military in nature—or, more likely,
some combination of the above. We must use the
most appropriate tool or combination of tools—acting
in alliance or partnership when our interests are
shared by others, but unilaterally when compelling
national interests so demand. At home, we must
forge an effective partnership of Federal, state and
local government agencies, industry and other private
sector organizations.

When efforts to deter an adversary—be it a rogue
nation, terrorist group or criminal organization—occur
in the context of a crisis, they become the leading
edge of crisis response. In this sense, deterrence
straddles the line between shaping the international
environment and responding to crises. Deterrence in
crisis generally involves signaling the United States’
commitment to a particular country or interest by
enhancing our warfighting capability in the theater.
Forces in or near the theater may be moved closer to
the crisis and other forces rapidly deployed to the
area. The U.S. may also choose to make additional
statements to communicate the costs of aggression
or coercion to an adversary, and in some cases may
choose to employ U.S. forces to underline the
message and deter further adventurism.

The American people rightfully play a central role in
how the United States wields its power abroad. The
United States cannot long sustain a commitment
without the support of the public, and close
consultations with Congress are important in this
effort. When it is judged in America’s interest to
intervene, we must remain clear in purpose and
resolute in execution.

Transnational Threats

Today, American diplomats, law enforcement
officials, military personnel, members of the
intelligence community and others are increasingly
called upon to respond to growing transnational
threats, particularly terrorism, drug trafficking and
international organized crime.

Terrorism

To meet the growing challenge of terrorism, President
Clinton signed Presidential Decision Directive 62 in
May 1998. This Directive creates a new and more
systematic approach to fighting the terrorist threat of
the next century. It reinforces the mission of the
many U.S. agencies charged with roles in defeating
terrorism; it also codifies and clarifies their activities in
the wide range of U.S. counter-terrorism programs,
including apprehension and prosecution of terrorists,
increasing transportation security, and enhancing
incident response capabilities. The Directive will help
achieve the President's goal of ensuring that we meet
the threat of terrorism in the 21“ century.

 

Our policy to counter international terrorists rests on
the following principles: (1) make no concessions to
terrorists; (2) bring all pressure to bear on all state
sponsors of terrorism; (3) fully exploit all available
legal mechanisms to punish international terrorists;
and (4) help other governments improve their
capabilities to combat terrorism. Following these
principles, we seek to uncover and eliminate foreign
terrorists and their support networks in our country;
eliminate terrorist sanctuaries; and counter state-
supported terrorism and subversion of moderate
regimes through a comprehensive program of
diplomatic, law enforcement, economic, military and
intelligence activities. We are working to improve
aviation security at airports in the United States and
worldwide, to ensure better security for all U.S.
transportation systems, and to improve protection for
our personnel assigned overseas.

Countering terrorism effectively requires day-to-day
coordination within the U.S. Government and close
cooperation with other governments and international
organizations. Foreign terrorists will not be allowed to
enter the United States, and the full force of legal
authorities will be used to remove foreign terrorists
from the United States and prevent fundraising within
the United States to support foreign terrorist activity.
We have seen positive results from the increasing
integration of intelligence, diplomatic, military and law
enforcement activities among the Departments of
State, Justice, Defense, Treasury, Energy,
Transportation, the CIA and other intelligence
agencies. The Administration is working with
Congress to increase the ability of these agencies to
combat terrorism through augmented funding and
manpower.

The United States has made concerted efforts to
deter and punish terrorists and remains determined to
apprehend and bring to justice those who terrorize
American citizens. In January 1998, the United
States signed the International Convention for the
Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. The Convention
fills an important gap in international law by
expanding the legal framework for international
cooperation in the investigation, prosecution and
extradition of persons who engage in such bombings.
Whenever possible, we use law enforcement and
diplomatic tools to wage the fight against terrorism.
But there have been, and will be, times when law
enforcement and diplomatic tools are simply not
enough, when our very national security is
challenged, and when we must take extraordinary

15

steps to protect the safety of our citizens. As long as
terrorists continue to target American citizens, we
reserve the right to act in self defense by striking at
their bases and those who sponsor, assist or actively
support them. We exercised that right in 1993 with
the attack against Iraqi intelligence headquarters in
response to Baghdad's assassination attempt against
former President Bush. We exercised that right again
in August 1998.

On August 7, 1998, 12 Americans and nearly 300
Kenyans and Tanzanians lost their lives, and another
5,000 were wounded when our embassies in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam were bombed. Soon afterward,
our intelligence community acquired convincing
information from a variety of reliable sources that the
network of radical groups affiliated with Osama bin
Laden, perhaps the preeminent organizer and
financier of international terrorism in the world today,
planned, financed and carried out the bombings. The
groups associated with bin Laden come from diverse
places, but share a hatred for democracy, a fanatical
glorification of violence and a horrible distortion of
their religion to justify the murder of innocents. They
have made the United States their adversary
precisely because of what we stand for and what we
stand against.

On August 20, 1998, our Armed Forces carried out
strikes against terrorist facilities and infrastructure in
Afghanistan. Our forces targeted one of the most
active terrorist bases in the world. It contained key
elements of the bin Laden network's infrastructure
and has served as a training camp for literally
thousands of terrorists from around the globe. Our
forces also attacked a factory in Sudan associated
with the bin Laden network that was involved in the
production of materials for chemical weapons. The
strikes were a necessary and proportionate response
to the imminent threat of further terrorist attacks
against U.S. personnel and facilities. Afghanistan
and Sudan had been warned for years to stop
harboring and supporting these terrorist groups.
Countries that persistently host terrorists have no
right to be safe havens.

Placing terrorism at the top of the diplomatic agenda
has increased international information sharing and
law enforcement efforts. At the June 1997 Denver
Summit of the Eight, the leaders of Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom
and the United States reaffirmed their determination
to combat terrorism in all forms, their opposition to

16

 

concessions to terrorist demands and their determi-
nation to deny hostage-takers any benefits from their
acts. They agreed to intensify diplomatic efforts to
ensure that by the year 2000 all States have joined
the international counterterrorism conventions
specified in the 1996 UN resolution on measures to
counter terrorism. The eight leaders also agreed to
strengthen the capability of hostage negotiation
experts and counterterrorism response units, to
exchange information on technologies to detect and
deter the use of weapons of mass destruction in
terrorist attacks, to develop means to deter terrorist
attacks on electronic and computer infrastructure, to
strengthen maritime security, to exchange informa-
tion on security practices for international special
events, and to strengthen and expand international
cooperation and consultation on terrorism.

International Crime

International crime is a serious and potent threat to
the American people at home and abroad. Drug
trafficking, illegal trade in firearms, financial crimes—
such as money laundering, counterfeiting, advanced
fee and credit card fraud, and income tax evasion—
illegal alien smuggling, trafficking in women and
children, economic espionage, intellectual property
theft, computer hacking and public corruption are all
linked to international criminal activity and all have a
direct impact on the security and prosperity of the
American people.

Efforts to combat international crime can have a
much broader impact than simply halting individual
criminal acts. The efficiency of the market place
depends on transparency and effective law
enforcement, which limit distorting factors such as
extortion and corruption. A free and efficient market
implies not only the absence of state control but also
limits on unlawful activities that impede rational
business decisions and fair competition. Additionally,
the integrity and reliability of the international financial
system will be improved by standardizing laws and
regulations governing financial institutions and
improving international law enforcement cooperation
in the financial sector.

To address the increasing threat from these diverse
criminal activities, we have formulated an
International Crime Control Strategy that provides a
framework for integrating the federal government

response to international crime. The strategy's major
goals and initiatives are to:

* Extend our crime control efforts beyond U.S.
borders by intensifying activities of law
enforcement and diplomatic personnel abroad to
prevent criminal acts and prosecute select
criminal acts committed abroad.

* Protect U.S. borders by enhancing our inspection,
detection, monitoring and interdiction efforts,
seeking stiffer criminal penalties for smuggling,
and targeting law enforcement resources more
effectively against smugglers.

* Deny safe haven to international criminals by
negotiating new international agreements for
evidence sharing and prompt arrest and
extradition of fugitives (including nationals of the
requested country), implementing strengthened
immigration laws to prevent criminals from
entering the United States and provide for their
prompt expulsion when appropriate, and
promoting increased cooperation with foreign law
enforcement authorities.

* Counter international financial crime by
combating money laundering and reducing
movement of criminal proceeds, seizing the
assets of international criminals, enhancing
bilateral and multilateral cooperation against
financial crime, and targeting offshore sources of
international fraud, counterfeiting, electronic
access device schemes, income tax evasion and
other financial crimes.

¢ Prevent criminal exploitation of international trade
by interdicting illegal technology exports, prevent-
ing unfair and predatory trade practices, protect-
ing intellectual property rights, countering indus-
trial theft and economic espionage, and enforcing
import restrictions on harmful substances,
dangerous organisms and protected species. In
fiscal year 1997, the Customs Service seized $59
million in goods and $55 million in currency being
taken out of the country illegally.

* Respond to emerging international crime threats
by disrupting new activities of international
organized crime groups, enhancing intelligence
efforts, reducing trafficking in human beings
(involuntary servitude, alien smuggling, document
fraud and denial of human rights), crimes against

 

children, and increasing enforcement efforts
against high technology and computer-related
crime.

* Foster international cooperation and the rule of
law by establishing international standards, goals
and objectives to combat international crime and
by actively encouraging compliance, improving
bilateral cooperation with foreign governments
and law enforcement authorities, expanding U.S.
training and assistance programs in law
enforcement and administration of justice, and
strengthening the rule of law as the foundation for
democratic government and free markets.

The growing threat to our security from transnational
crime makes international law enforcement coopera-
tion vital. We are negotiating and implementing up-
dated extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties
that reflect the changing nature of international crime
and prevent terrorists and criminals from exploiting
national borders to escape prosecution. Moreover,
since the primary motivation of most international
criminals is greed, powerful asset seizure, forfeiture
and money laundering laws are key tools for taking
action against the financial underpinnings of interna-
tional crime. Increasing our enforcement powers
through bilateral and multilateral agreements and
efforts makes it harder for criminals to enjoy their ill-
gotten gains.

At the Birmingham Summit in May 1998, the leaders
of the G-8 adopted a wide range of measures to
strengthen the cooperative efforts against
international crime that they launched at their summit
in Lyon two years ago. They agreed to increase
cooperation on transnational high technology crime,
money laundering and financial crime, corruption,
environmental crimes, and trafficking in drugs,
firearms and women and children. They also agreed
to fully support negotiations on a UN Convention on
Transnational Organized Crime, which will broaden
many of the efforts underway among the G-8 to the
rest of the international community.

No area of criminal activity has greater international
implications than high technology crime because of
the global nature of information networks. Computer
hackers and other cyber-criminals are not hampered
by international boundaries, since information and
transactions involving funds or property can be
transmitted quickly and covertly via telephone and
information systems. Law enforcement faces difficult
challenges in this area, many of which are impossible

17

to address without international consensus and
cooperation. We seek to develop and implement new
agreements with other nations to address high
technology crime, particularly cyber-crime.

We are making a concerted effort at home and
abroad to shut down the illicit trade in firearms,
ammunition and explosives that fuels the violence
associated with terrorism, drug trafficking and
international crime. The President has signed
legislation amending the Arms Export Control Act to
expand our authority to monitor and regulate the
activities of arms brokers and we have intensified
reviews of applications for licenses to export firearms
from the United States to ensure that they are not
diverted to illicit purposes. The Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) has tightened up proof
of residency requirements for aliens purchasing
firearms from dealers in the United States, and ATF
and the Customs Service have intensified their
interdiction and investigative efforts at U.S. borders.

In the international arena, the United States is
working with its partners in the G-8 and through the
UN Crime Commission to expand cooperation on
combating illicit arms trafficking. In November 1997,
the United States and its partners in the Organization
of American States (OAS) signed the Inter-American
Convention Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and
Trafficking in Firearms—the first international
agreement designed to prevent, combat and
eradicate illegal trafficking in firearms, ammunition
and explosives. We are now negotiating an
international agreement that would globalize the OAS
convention. Additionally, the ATF and Customs
Service have provided training and assistance to
other nations on tracing firearms, combating internal
smuggling and related law enforcement topics.

Drug Trafficking

We have shown that with determined and relentless
efforts, we can make significant progress against the
scourge of drug abuse and drug trafficking. In the
United States, drug use has dropped 49 percent
since 1979. Recent studies show that drug use by
our young people is stabilizing, and in some
categories, declining. Overall, cocaine use has
dropped 70 percent since 1985 and the crack
epidemic has begun to recede. Today, Americans
spend 37 percent less on drugs than a decade ago.

18

 

That means over $34 billion reinvested in our society,
rather than squandered on drugs.

The aim of the U.S. National Drug Control Strategy is
to cut drug availability in the United States by half
over the next 10 years—and reduce the
consequences of drug use and trafficking by 25
percent over the same period—through expanded
prevention efforts, improved treatment programs,
strengthened law enforcement and tougher
interdiction. Our strategy recognizes that, at home
and abroad, prevention, treatment and economic
alternatives must be integrated with intelligence
collection, law enforcement and interdiction. Its
ultimate success will require concerted efforts by the
public, all levels of government and the private sector
together with other governments, private groups and
international organizations.

Domestically, we seek to educate and enable
America’s youth to reject illegal drugs, increase the
safety of America’s citizens by substantially reducing
drug-related crime and violence, reduce health and
social costs to the public of illegal drug use, and
shield America’s air, land and sea frontiers from the
drug threat. Working with Congress and the private
sector, the Administration has launched a major
antidrug youth media campaign and will seek to
extend this program through 2002. With
congressional support and matching dollars from the
private sector, we will commit to a five-year, $2 billion
public-private partnership to educate our children to
reject drugs.

In concert with our allies abroad, we seek to stop
drug trafficking by reducing cultivation of drug-
producing crops, interdicting the flow of drugs at the
source and in transit (particularly in Central and South
America, the Caribbean, Mexico and Southeast Asia),
and stopping drugs from entering our country. The
Strategy includes efforts to strengthen democratic
institutions and root out corruption in source nations,
prosecute major international drug traffickers and
destroy trafficking organizations, prevent money
laundering and use of commercial air and maritime
transportation for drug smuggling, and eradicate
illegal drug crops and encourage alternate crop
development or alternative employment in source
nations. We seek to achieve a counterdrug alliance
in this hemisphere, one that could serve as a model
for enhanced cooperation in other regions.

The United States is aggressively engaging
international organizations, financial institutions and
non-governmental organizations in counternarcotics
cooperation. At the Birmingham Summit in May
1998, the leaders of the G-8 endorsed the principle of
shared responsibility for combating drugs, including
cooperative efforts focused on both eradication and
demand reduction. They agreed to reinforce
cooperation on reducing demand and curbing
trafficking in drugs and chemical precursors. They
also agreed on the need for a global strategy to
eradicate illicit drugs. The United States supports the
UN International Drug Control Program's goal of
dramatically reducing coca and opium poppy
cultivation by 2008 and the program’s efforts to
combat drug production, trafficking and abuse in
some of the most remote regions of the world. At the
UN General Assembly Special Session on drug
trafficking and abuse in June 1998, President Clinton
and other world leaders strengthened existing
international counterdrug institutions, reconfirmed the
global partnership against drug abuse and stressed
the need for a coordinated international approach to
combating drug trafficking.

Emerging Threats at Home

Due to our military superiority, potential enemies,
whether nations or terrorist groups, may be more
likely in the future to resort to terrorist acts or other
attacks against vulnerable civilian targets in the
United States instead of conventional military
operations. At the same time, easier access to
sophisticated technology means that the destructive
power available to terrorists is greater than ever.
Adversaries may thus be tempted to use
unconventional tools, such as WMD or information
attacks, to threaten our citizens, and critical national
infrastructures.

Managing the Consequences of WMD
Incidents

Presidential Decision Directive 62, signed in May
1998, established an overarching policy and
assignment of responsibilities for responding to
terrorist acts involving WMD. The Federal Govern-
ment will respond rapidly and decisively to any
terrorist incident in the United States, working with
state and local governments to restore order and
deliver emergency assistance. The Department of
Justice, acting through the FBI, has the overall lead in
operational response to a WMD incident. The

 

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
supports the FBI in preparing for and responding to
the consequences of a WMD incident.

The Domestic Terrorism Program is integrating the
capabilities and assets of a number of Federal
agencies to support the FBI, FEMA and state and
local governments in consequence management.
The program’s goal is to build a capability in 120
major U.S. cities for first responders to be able to
deal with WMD incidents by 2002. In fiscal year
1997, the Defense Department provided training to
nearly 1,500 metropolitan emergency responders—
firefighters, law enforcement officials and medical
personnel—in four cities. In fiscal year 1998, the
program will reach 31 cities. Eventually, this training
will reach all cities via the Internet, video and CD
ROM.

Under the Domestic Terrorism Program, the Defense
Department will maintain military units to serve as
augmentation forces for weapons of mass destruction
consequence management and to help maintain
proficiency of local emergency responders through
periodic training and exercises. The National Guard,
with its mission and long tradition of responding to
national emergencies, has an important role to play in
this effort. The President announced in May 1998
that the Defense Department will train Army National
Guard and reserve elements to assist state and local
authorities to manage the consequences of a WMD
attack. This training will be given to units in
Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Georgia,
Illinois, Texas, Missouri, Colorado, California and
Washington.

The Domestic Terrorism Program enlists the support
of other agencies as well. The Department of Energy
plans for and provides emergency responder training
for nuclear and radiological incidents. The
Environmental Protection Agency plans for and
provides emergency responder training for hazardous
materials and environmental incidents. The
Department of Health and Human Services, through
the Public Health Service and with the support of the
Department of Veterans Affairs and other Federal
agencies, plans and prepares for a national response
to medical emergencies arising from the terrorist use
of weapons of mass destruction.

The threat of biological weapons is particularly

troubling. In his May 1998 commencement speech at
Annapolis, the President announced a

19

comprehensive strategy to protect our civilian
population from the scourge of biological weapons.
There are four critical areas of focus:

¢ First, if a hostile nation or terrorists release
bacteria or viruses to harm Americans, we must
be able to identify the pathogens with speed and
certainty. We will upgrade our public health and
medical surveillance systems. These
improvements will benefit not only our
preparedness for a biological weapons attack—
they will enhance our ability to respond quickly
and effectively to outbreaks of emerging
infectious diseases.

* Second, our emergency response personnel
must have the training and equipment to do their
jobs right. As described above, we will help
ensure that federal, state and local authorities
have the resources and knowledge they need to
deal with a crisis.

¢ Third, we must have the medicines and vaccines
needed to treat those who fall sick or prevent
those at risk from falling ill because of a biological
weapons attack. The President will propose the
creation of a civilian stockpile of medicines and
vaccines to counter the pathogens most likely to
be in the hands of terrorists or hostile powers.

¢ Fourth, the revolution in biotechnology offers
enormous possibilities for combating biological
weapons. We will coordinate research and
development efforts to use the advances in
genetic engineering and biotechnology to create
the next generation of medicines, vaccines and
diagnostic tools for use against these weapons.
At the same time, we must continue our efforts to
prevent biotechnology innovations from being
applied to development of ever more difficult to
counter biological weapons.

Protecting Critical Infrastructures

Our military power and national economy are
increasingly reliant upon interdependent critical
infrastructures—the physical and information systems
essential to the operations of the economy and
government. They include telecommunications,
energy, banking and finance, transportation, water
systems and emergency services. It has long been
the policy of the United States to assure the continuity

20

 

and viability of these critical infrastructures. But
advances in information technology and competitive
pressure to improve efficiency and productivity have
created new vulnerabilities to both physical and
information attacks as these infrastructures have
become increasingly automated and interlinked. If we
do not implement adequate protective measures,
attacks on our critical infrastructures and information
systems by nations, groups or individuals might be
capable of significantly harming our military power
and economy.

To enhance our ability to protect these critical
infrastructures, the President signed Presidential
Decision Directive 63 in May 1998. This directive
makes it U.S. policy to take all necessary measures
to swiftly eliminate any significant vulnerability to
physical or information attacks on our critical
infrastructures, especially our information systems.
We will achieve and maintain the ability to protect
them from intentional acts that would significantly
diminish the abilities of the Federal Government to
perform essential national security missions and to
ensure the general public health and safety. We will
protect the ability of state and local governments to
maintain order and to deliver minimum essential
public services. And we will work with the private
sector to ensure the orderly functioning of the
economy and the delivery of essential
telecommunications, energy, financial and
transportation services. Any interruption or
manipulation of these critical functions must be brief,
infrequent, manageable, isolated and minimally
detrimental to the welfare of the United States.

The National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC)
integrates relevant federal, state, and local govern-
ment entities as well as the private sector, and
provides the national focal point for gathering
information on threats to the infrastructures. It serves
as a national resource for identifying and assessing
threats, warning about vulnerabilities, and conducting
criminal investigations. The NIPC will also coordinate
the federal government's response to an incident,
including mitigation, investigation and monitoring
reconstruction efforts.

Smaller-Scale Contingencies

Smaller-scale contingency operations encompass the
full range of military operations short of major theater
warfare, including humanitarian assistance, peace

operations, enforcing embargoes and no-fly zones,
evacuating U.S. citizens, reinforcing key allies, and
limited strikes and intervention. These operations will
likely pose the most frequent challenge for U.S.
forces and cumulatively require significant
commitments over time. These operations will also
put a premium on the ability of the U.S. military to
work closely and effectively with other U.S.
Government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, regional and international security
organizations and coalition partners.

 

Under certain circumstances the U.S. military may
provide appropriate and necessary humanitarian
assistance. Those circumstances are when a natural
or manmade disaster dwarfs the ability of the normal
relief agencies to respond or the need for relief is
urgent, and the military has a unique ability to
respond quickly with minimal risk to American lives.
In these cases, the United States may intervene when
the costs and risks are commensurate with the
stakes involved and when there is reason to believe
that our action can make a real difference. Such
efforts by the United States and the international
community will be limited in duration, have a clearly
defined end state and be designed to give the
affected country the opportunity to restore its own
basic services. This policy recognizes that the U.S.
military normally is not the best tool for addressing
long-term humanitarian concerns and that, ultimately,
responsibility for the fate of a nation rests with its own
people.

At times it will be in our national interest to proceed in
partnership with others to preserve, maintain and
restore peace. American participation in peace
operations takes many forms, such as the NATO-led
coalition in Bosnia, the American-led UN force in
Haiti, the Military Observer Mission Ecuador and Peru
(MOMEP), and our participation in the multilateral
coalition operation in the Sinai. The question of
command and control in multinational contingency
operations is particularly critical. Under no
circumstances will the President ever relinquish his
constitutionally mandated command authority over
U.S. forces, but there may be times when it is in our
interest to place U.S. forces under the temporary
operational control of a competent allied or United
Nations commander.

Not only must the U.S. military be prepared to
successfully conduct multiple smaller-scale
contingencies worldwide, it must be prepared to do so
in the face of challenges such as terrorism,
information operations and the threat or use of
weapons of mass destruction. U.S. forces must also
remain prepared to withdraw from contingency
operations if needed to deploy to a major theater war.
Accordingly, appropriate U.S. forces will be kept at a
high level of readiness and will be trained, equipped
and organized to be multi-mission capable.

21

Major Theater Warfare

Fighting and winning major theater wars is the
ultimate test of our Total Force—a test at which it
must always succeed. For the foreseeable future, the
United States, preferably in concert with allies, must
remain able to deter and defeat large-scale, cross-
border aggression in two distant theaters in
overlapping time frames. Maintaining such a
capability deters opportunism elsewhere while we are
heavily committed to deterring or defeating
aggression in one theater, or while conducting
multiple smaller-scale contingencies and engagement
activities in other theaters. It also provides a hedge
against the possibility that we might encounter threats
larger or more difficult than we expected. A strategy
for deterring and defeating aggression in two theaters
ensures we maintain the capability and flexibility to
meet unknown future threats, while continued global
engagement helps preclude such threats from
developing.

Fighting and winning major theater wars entails at
least three particularly challenging requirements.
First, we must maintain the ability to rapidly defeat
initial enemy advances short of enemy objectives in
two theaters, in close succession. The United States
must maintain this ability to ensure that we can seize
the initiative, minimize territory lost before an invasion
is halted and ensure the integrity of our warfighting
coalitions. To meet this challenge, the forces that
would be first to respond to an act of aggression are
kept at full readiness, and the forces that follow them
are kept at a level that supports their being ready to
deploy and go into action when called for in the
operations plan for the contingency.

Second, the United States must plan and prepare to
fight and win under conditions where an adversary
may use asymmetric means against us—
unconventional approaches that avoid or undermine
our strengths while exploiting our vulnerabilities. This
is of particular importance and a significant challenge.
Because of our dominance in the conventional
military arena, adversaries who challenge the United
States are likely to use asymmetric means, such as
WMD, information operations or terrorism.

22

 

The WMD threat to our forces is receiving the special
attention it deserves. We are enhancing the
preparedness of our Armed Forces to effectively
conduct sustained operations despite the presence,
threat or use of WMD. Such preparedness requires
the capability to deter, detect, protect against and
respond to the use of WMD when necessary. The
Administration has significantly increased funding to
enhance biological and chemical defense capabilities
and has begun the vaccination of military personnel
against the anthrax bacteria, the most feared
biological weapon threat today. These efforts
reinforce our deterrent posture and complement our
nonproliferation efforts by reducing the political and
military value of WMD and their means of delivery.

We are enhancing our ability to defend against hostile
information operations, which could in the future take
the form of a full-scale, strategic information attack
against our critical national infrastructures,
government and economy—as well as attacks
directed against our military forces. As other
countries develop their capability to conduct offensive
information operations, we must ensure that our
national and defense information infrastructures are
well protected and that we can quickly recognize,
defend against and respond decisively to an
information attack.

Third, our military must also be able to transition to
fighting major theater wars from a posture of global
engagement—from substantial levels of peacetime
engagement overseas as well as multiple concurrent
smaller-scale contingencies. Withdrawing from such
operations would pose significant political and
operational challenges. Ultimately, however, the
United States must accept a degree of risk
associated with withdrawing from contingency
operations and engagement activities in order to
reduce the greater risk incurred if we failed to
respond adequately to major theater wars.

Our priority is to shape effectively the international
environment so as to deter the onset of major theater
wars. Should deterrence fail, however, the United
States will defend itself, its allies and partners with all
means necessary.

Preparing Now for an
Uncertain Future

We must prepare for an uncertain future even as we
address today’s security problems. This requires that
we keep our forces ready for shaping and responding
requirements in the near term, while at the same time
evolving our unparalleled capabilities to ensure we
can effectively shape and respond in the future.

The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) struck
a fine balance between near-term readiness, long-
term modernization and quality of life improvements
for our men and women in uniform. A key element of
this balance was our decision to increase funding for
modernization to protect long-term readiness. In this
context we decided to make modest reductions in
personnel, primarily in support positions, across the
force structure. But in all these decisions we ensured
that the high readiness levels of our forward-deployed
and ""first-to-fight"" forces were maintained. While
preparing for the challenges of the next century, the
readiness of today’s force remains one of our highest
priorities. That is why the Administration, in
partnership with the Congress, will continue to assure
we maintain the best-trained, best-equipped and
best-led military force in the world for the 21*
Century.

Government-wide, we will continue to foster
innovative approaches, capabilities, technologies and
organizational structures to better protect American
lives, property and interests at home and abroad. In
our defense efforts, we will continue to explore new
approaches for integrating the Active and Reserve
components into a Total Force optimum for future
missions, modernize our forces, ensure the quality of
military personnel, and take prudent steps to position
ourselves to effectively counter unlikely but significant
future threats. We will also continue our rapidly
growing efforts to integrate and improve the capability
of Federal, state and local agencies—and our private
sector partners—to protect against and respond to
transnational threats at home.

The military challenges of the 21st century, coupled
with the aging of key elements of the U.S. force
structure, require a fundamental transformation of our
military forces. Although future threats are fluid and
unpredictable, U.S. forces are likely to confront a
variety of challenges across the spectrum of conflict,
including efforts to deny our forces access to critical

 

regions, urban warfare, information warfare, and
attacks from chemical and biological weapons. To
meet these challenges, we must transform our forces
by exploiting the Revolution in Military Affairs.
Improved intelligence collection and assessment
coupled with modern information processing,
navigation and command and control capabilities are
at the heart of the transformation of our warfighting
capabilities. Through a carefully planned and focused
modernization program, we can maintain our
technological superiority and replace Cold War-era
equipment with new systems capable of taking full
advantage of emerging technologies. With these
advanced systems, the U.S. military will be able to
respond rapidly to any contingency, dominate the
battlespace and conduct day-to-day operations much
more efficiently and effectively.

To support this transformation of our military forces,
we will work cooperatively with the Congress to enact
legislation to implement the Defense Reform
Initiative, which will free up resources through a
Revolution in Business Affairs. This revolution
includes privatization, acquisition reform and
elimination of excess infrastructure through two
additional base realignment and closure (BRAC)
rounds in 2001 and 2005. The Revolution in Military
Affairs and the Revolution in Business Affairs are
interlocking revolutions: With both, and only with both,
we will ensure that U.S. forces continue to have
unchallenged superiority in the 21° century.

It is critical that we renew our commitment to
America’s diplomacy—to ensure we have the
diplomatic representation required to support our
global interests. This is central to our ability to remain
an influential voice on international issues that affect
our well-being. We will preserve that influence so
long as we retain the diplomatic capabilities, military
wherewithal and economic base to underwrite our
commitments credibly.

We must continue aggressive efforts to construct
appropriate twenty-first century national security
programs and structures. The Defense Department,
State Department and other international affairs
agencies are similarly reorganizing to confront the

23

pressing challenges of tomorrow as well as those we
face today. Federal, state and local law enforcement
and emergency response agencies are enhancing
their ability to deal with terrorist threats. Government
and industry are exploring ways to protect critical
national infrastructures. We will continue looking
across our government to see if during this time of
transition we are adequately preparing to meet the
national security challenges of the next century.

Without preparing today to face the pressing
challenges of tomorrow, our ability to exert global
leadership and to create international conditions
conducive to achieving our national goals would be in
doubt. Thus, we must strive to strike the right
balance between the near-term readiness
requirements of shaping and responding and the
longer-term transformation requirements associated
with preparing now for national security challenges in
the twenty-first century.

Overarching Capabilities

Certain capabilities and technologies are critical to
protecting the United States itself and to the
worldwide application of U.S. national power for
shaping the international environment and responding
to the full spectrum of threats and crises.

Quality People

Quality people—military and civilian—are our most
critical asset. The quality of our men and women in
uniform will be the deciding factor in all future military
operations. In order to fully realize the benefits of the
transformation of our military forces, we must ensure
that we remain the most fully prepared and best
trained fighting force in the world. Our people will
continue to remain the linchpin to successfully
exploiting our military capabilities across the
spectrum of conflict. To ensure the quality of our
military personnel, we will continue to place the
highest priority on initiatives and programs that
support recruiting, quality of life, and the training and
education of our men and women in uniform.

We must also have quality civilian personnel in the
government agencies that support our national
security, from our diplomatic corps, to the intelligence
community and law enforcement. Effectively
countering transnational threats requires personnel

24

 

with a variety of highly specialized skills that either are
not readily available in the private sector, or are in
high demand in the private sector. Persons with
advanced training in information technology are a
prominent example. Recruiting and retaining quality
people with requisite skills is a significant challenge,
and we are exploring innovative approaches for
ensuring that government personnel needs are met.

Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance

Our intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) capabilities are critical instruments for
implementing our national security strategy. The U.S.
intelligence community provides critical support to the
full range of our activities abroad—diplomatic,
military, law enforcement, and environmental.
Comprehensive collection and analytic capabilities
are needed to provide warning of threats to U.S.
national security, give analytical support to the policy
and military communities, provide near-real time
intelligence in times of crisis while retaining global
perspective, identify opportunities for advancing our
national interests, and maintain our information
advantage in the international arena.

ISR operations must cover a wider range of threats
and policy needs than ever before. We place the
highest priority on preserving and enhancing
intelligence capabilities that provide information on
states and groups that pose the most serious threats
to U.S. security. Current intelligence priorities include
states whose policies and actions are hostile to the
United States; countries or other entities that possess
strategic nuclear forces or control nuclear weapons,
other WMD or nuclear fissile materials; transnational
threats, including terrorism, international crime and
drug trafficking; potential regional conflicts that might
affect U.S. national security interests; intensified
counterintelligence against foreign intelligence
collection inimical to U.S. interests, including
economic and industrial espionage; information
warfare threats; and threats to U.S. forces and
citizens abroad. Intelligence support is also required
to develop and implement U.S. policies to promote
democracy abroad, identify threats to our information
and space systems, monitor arms control
agreements, support humanitarian efforts and protect
the environment.

Our ISR capabilities include world-wide collection of
news and media broadcasts, reporting from
informants close to important events abroad, space-
based and airborne collection of imagery and signals
intelligence, and integrated, in-depth analysis of all
these sources by highly skilled analysts. Exploiting
our tremendous advantage in continuous, non-
intrusive, space-based imaging and information
processing, the ISR system provides the ability to
monitor treaty compliance, military movements and
the development, testing and deployment of weapons
of mass destruction. Using ISR products to support
diplomatic and military action contributes to global
security by demonstrating that the United States is an
invaluable ally, or would be a formidable foe.

U.S. intelligence capabilities were reviewed twice by
independent panels in 1998. In the wake of the May
1998 Indian nuclear tests, retired Admiral David E.
Jeremiah led a panel that examined the Intelligence
Community's ability to detect and monitor foreign
nuclear weapons programs. In July 1998, the
Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to
the United States issued a report on the challenges
we face in attempting to monitor the progress of
foreign ballistic missile programs. Both reviews
identified specific areas of intelligence collection and
analysis that need improvement. The Intelligence
Community is taking aggressive action to improve its
capabilities in those areas and we will work closely
with the Congress to address the recommendations
in the two reports.

While our ISR capabilities are increasingly enhanced
by and dependent upon advanced technologies, there
remains no substitute for informed, subjective human
judgment. We must continue to attract and retain
enough highly qualified people to provide human
intelligence collection, translation and analysis in
those many emerging areas where there simply is no
technological substitute, and we must forge strong
links to the private enterprises and public institutions
whose expertise is especially critical. Increased
cooperation among the agencies in the Intelligence
Community and the fusion of all intelligence
disciplines provide the most effective collection and
analysis of data on high priority intelligence issues.

We must also be mindful of the continuing need for
effective security and counterintelligence programs.
To protect sensitive national security information, we
must be able to effectively counter the collection
efforts of foreign intelligence services through

 

vigorous counterintelligence efforts, comprehensive
security programs and constant evaluation of the
intentions and targets of foreign intelligence services.
Counterintelligence remains integral to and underlies
the entire intelligence mission, whether the threat
comes from traditional espionage or the theft of our
vital economic information. Countering foreign efforts
to gather technological, industrial and commercial
information requires close cooperation between
government and the private sector. Awareness of the
threat and adherence to prescribed personnel,
information and physical security standards and
procedures, based on risk management principles,
are critical.

Space

We are committed to maintaining our leadership in
space. Unimpeded access to and use of space is
essential for protecting U.S. national security,
promoting our prosperity and ensuring our well-being
in countless ways.

Space has emerged in this decade as a new global
information utility with extensive political, diplomatic,
military and economic implications for the United
States. We are experiencing an ever-increasing
migration of capabilities to space as the world seeks to
exploit the explosion in information technology.
Telecommunications, telemedicine, international
financial transactions and global entertainment, news,
education, weather and navigation all contribute directly
to the strength of our economy—and all are dependent
upon space capabilities. Over 500 US companies are
directly involved in the space industry, with 1996
revenues of $77 billion projected to reach $122 billion
by 2000.

Our policy is to promote development of the full range

of space-based capabilities in a manner that protects
our vital security interests. We will deter

25

threats to our interests in space and, if deterrence
fails, defeat hostile efforts against U.S. access to and
use of space. We will also maintain the ability to
counter space systems and services that could be
used for hostile purposes against our ground, air and
naval forces, our command and control system, or
other capabilities critical to our national security. We
are carefully regulating U.S. commercial space-based
remote sensing to ensure that space imagery is not
used to the detriment of U.S. security interests. At
the same time, we will continue efforts to prevent the
spread of weapons of mass destruction to space, and
continue to form global partnerships with other space-
faring nations across the spectrum of economic,
political, environmental and security issues. These
efforts require a balanced approach across all types
of U.S. space assets—national security, military, and
commercial. We will remain vigilant to ensure that we
do not compromise our technological superiority while
promoting partnerships in space.

Missile Defense

We have robust missile defense development and
deployment programs focused on systems to protect
deployed U.S. forces and our friends and allies
against theater ballistic missiles armed with
conventional weapons or WMD. These systems will
complement and strengthen our deterrence and
nonproliferation efforts by reducing incentives to
develop or use WMD. Significantly, Presidents
Clinton and Yeltsin agreed at the Helsinki Summit to
maintain the ABM Treaty as a cornerstone of
strategic stability, yet adapt it to meet the threat
posed by shorter-range missiles—a threat we seek to
counter with U.S. theater missile defense (TMD)
systems. The ABM-TMD demarcation agreement
signed in New York on September 26, 1997 helps
clarify the distinction between ABM systems, which
the ABM Treaty limits, and TMD systems, which the
ABM Treaty does not limit. The demarcation
agreement does not limit any current U.S. core TMD
programs, all of which have been certified by the
United States as compliant with the ABM Treaty.

Although it remains the view of the intelligence
community that it is unlikely that countries other than
Russia, China and perhaps North Korea will deploy
an ICBM capable of reaching any part of the U.S.
before 2010, we are developing, consistent with our
obligations under the ABM Treaty, a limited national
missile defense capability that would position the U.S.

26

 

to make a decision as early as the year 2000 to
deploy within three years a credible national missile
defense system.

National Security Emergency
Preparedness

We will do all we can to deter and prevent destructive
and threatening forces such as terrorism, WMD use,
disruption of our critical infrastructures, natural
disasters and regional or state-centered threats from
endangering our citizens. But if an emergency
occurs, we must also be prepared to respond
effectively at home and abroad to protect lives and
property, mobilize the personnel, resources and
capabilities necessary to effectively handle the
emergency, and ensure the survival of our institutions
and national infrastructures. National security
emergency preparedness is imperative, and
comprehensive, all-hazard emergency planning by
Federal departments, agencies and the military
continues to be a crucial national security
requirement.

Overseas Presence and Power
Projection

Due to our alliance commitments and other vital
interests overseas, we must have a force structure
and deployment posture that enable us to success-
fully conduct military operations across the spectrum
of conflict, often in theaters distant from the United
States. Maintaining a substantial overseas presence
promotes regional stability by giving form and
substance to our bilateral and multilateral security
commitments and helps prevent the development of
power vacuums and instability. It contributes to
deterrence by demonstrating our determination to
defend U.S., allied, and friendly interests in critical
regions and better positions the United States to
respond rapidly to crises. Equally essential is
effective and efficient global power projection, which
is the key to the flexibility demanded or our forces and
ultimately provides our national leaders with more
options in responding to potential crises and conflicts.
Being able to project power allows us to shape, deter,
and respond even when we have no permanent
presence or a limited infrastructure in the region.

Extensive transportation, logistics and command,
control, communications and intelligence (C31)
capabilities are unique U.S. strengths that enhance
our conventional deterrent and helps to shape the
international environment. Strategic mobility allows
the United States to be first on the scene with
assistance in many national or international crises
and is a key to successful American leadership and
engagement. The deployment of US and
multinational forces requires maintaining and
ensuring access to sufficient fleets of aircraft, ships,
vehicles and trains, as well as bases, ports,
prepositioned equipment and other infrastructure.
The United States must have a robust Defense
Transportation System, including both military assets
and U.S. flag commercial sealift and airlift, to remain
actively engaged in world affairs.

Our need for strategic mobility to deploy our forces
overseas is one of the primary reasons we are
committed to gaining Senate advice and consent to
ratification of the Law of the Sea Convention. Need
for this treaty arose from the breakdown of customary
international law as more and more nations
unilaterally declared ever larger territorial seas and
other claims over the oceans that threatened the
global access and freedom of navigation that the
United States must have to protect its vital national
interests. In addition to lending the certainty of the
rule of law to an area critical to our national security,
the treaty protects our economic interests and
preserves our leadership in global ocean policy. The
Law of the Sea Convention thus buttresses the
strategic advantages that the United States gains
from being a global power.

Promoting Prosperity

The second core objective of our national security
strategy is to promote America’s prosperity through
efforts at home and abroad. Our economic and
security interests are inextricably linked. Prosperity at
home depends on stability in key regions with which we
trade or from which we import critical commodities,
such as oil and natural gas. Prosperity also demands
our leadership in international development, financial
and trade institutions. In turn, the strength of our
diplomacy, our ability to maintain an unrivaled military
and the attractiveness of our values abroad depend in
large part on the strength of our economy.

 

Strengthening Macroeconomic
Coordination

As national economies become more integrated
internationally, the United States cannot thrive in
isolation from developments abroad. Our economic
health is vulnerable to disturbances that originate
outside our borders. As such, cooperation with other
states and international organizations is vital to
protecting the health of the global economic system
and responding to financial crises.

The recent financial troubles in Asia have
demonstrated that global financial markets dominated
by private capital flows provide both immense
opportunities and great challenges. Developing ways
to strengthen the international financial architecture is
an urgent and compelling challenge. At the
November 1997 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
Forum (APEC) meeting, President Clinton and the
other APEC leaders agreed to hold a series of
meetings of finance ministers and central bank
governors to address the Asian financial crisis and
international financial reform. The meetings began in
February 1998 with representatives from 22 countries
and observers from the major international financial
institutions. The on-going efforts of this group,
commonly referred to as the Willard Group or G-22,
has helped to identify measures to prevent and better
manage financial crises and reform the international
financial system.

The ultimate objective of our reform efforts is a
stable, resilient global financial system that promotes
strong global economic growth providing benefits
broadly to workers and investors in all countries.
International financial institutions, particularly the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), have a critical role
to play in this effort by promoting greater openness
and transparency, by building strong national financial
systems, and by creating mechanisms so that the
private sector shares more fully in the responsibility
for preventing and resolving crises.

Openness and Transparency: For capital to flow
freely and safely to where it can be used most
efficiently to promote growth, high quality information
about each economy and investment opportunity
must also be freely available. The IMF introduced the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 1996
to improve the information collection and publication
practices of countries accessing international capital

27

markets. At present, 45 countries subscribe to the
SDDS, but we need to encourage those IMF
members who do not subscribe but seek access to
international capital markets—particularly emerging
market economies—to participate in the SDDS.
International financial institutions also have a
responsibility to make their activities open and
transparent as a means of enhancing their credibility
and accountability. The IMF recently has shown
leadership in promoting openness and transparency;
however, more needs be done in this area.

Financial Sector Reform: The IMF's recent review of
the Asian crisis experience highlighted the key role
played by the domestic financial sector as the flash
point and transmission mechanism for the crisis and
contagion. Rapid growth and expanding access to
international capital had run ahead of the
development in countries in trouble of a genuine
credit culture to assess risk and channel investment
efficiently and of an effective financial sector
regulatory and supervisory mechanism. The situation
was further exacerbated by inconsistent
macroeconomic policies, generous explicit and
implicit government guarantees, significant injections
of public funds to provide liquidity support to weak
institutions, and to some extent capital controls that
distorted the composition of capital flows.

Crisis Resolution: Our efforts to reduce the risks of
crises caused by poor policy or investor decisions
need to be complemented by measures to equip
investors, governments and the international financial
system with the means to deal with those crises that
do occur. The IMF plays the central role in the
system by providing conditional international
assistance to give countries the breathing room to
stabilize their economies and restore market
confidence. Two U.S.-inspired initiatives have
enhanced the IMF's role: the Emergency Financing
Mechanism, which provides for rapid agreement to
extraordinary financing requests in return for more
intense regular scrutiny, and the Supplemental
Reserve Facility, which enables the IMF to lend at
premium rates in short-term liquidity crises and
improve borrower incentives. To fulfill its crisis
resolution responsibility, the IMF must have adequate
resources. We are concerned that IMF liquidity has
fallen to dangerously low levels that could impair the
Fund's capacity to respond to renewed pressures and
meet normal demands. The Administration is making
an intensive effort to obtain the necessary

28

 

Congressional approval to meet our obligations to the
IMF.

Recent crises have brought home that in a global
financial market we need to find more effective
mechanisms for sharing with the private sector the
burden of managing such problems. In a world in
which trillions of dollars flow through international
markets every day, there is simply not going to be
enough official financing to meet the crises that could
take place. Moreover, official financing should not
absolve private investors from the consequences of
excessive risk-taking and thus create the ""moral
hazard"" that could plant the seeds of future crises.

Broadening the Financial Reform Agenda: In
recent years, the IMF has broadened its perspective
to take account of a wider range of issues necessary
for economic growth and financial stability. It is
seeking to create a more level playing field in which
private sector competition can thrive; reduce
unproductive government spending, including
excessive military expenditures and subsidies and
guarantees to favored sectors and firms; protect the
most vulnerable segments of society from bearing the
brunt of the burden of adjustment; and encourage
more effective participation by labor and the rest of
civil society in the formulation and implementation of
economic policies, including protection of labor rights.

The United States and the other leading industrialized
nations are also promoting a range of World Bank and
regional development bank reforms that the United
States has been urging for a number of years. Key
elements include substantially increasing the share of
resources devoted to basic social programs that
reduce poverty; safeguarding the environment;
supporting development of the private sector and open
markets; promotion of good governance, including
measures to fight corruption and improve the
administration of justice; and internal reforms of the
multilateral development banks (MDBs) to make them
more efficient. Furthermore, international financial
institutions such as the IMF and MDBs have played a
strong role in recent years in countries and regions of
key interest to the United States, such as Russia, the
Middle East, Haiti and Bosnia.

Enhancing American
Competitiveness

We seek to ensure a business environment in which
the innovative and competitive efforts of the private
sector can flourish. To this end, we will continue to
encourage the development, commercialization and
use of civilian technology. We will invest in a world-
class infrastructure for the twenty-first century,
including the national information and space
infrastructure essential for our knowledge-based
economy. We will invest in education and training to
develop a workforce capable of participating in our
rapidly changing economy. And we will continue our
efforts to open foreign markets to U.S. goods and
services.

Enhancing Access to Foreign
Markets

In a world where over 95 percent of the world’s
consumers live outside the United States, we must
expand our international trade to sustain economic
growth at home. Our prosperity as a nation in the
twenty-first century will depend upon our ability to
compete effectively in international markets. The
rapidly expanding global economy presents enor-
mous opportunities for American companies and
workers. Over the next decade the global economy is
expected to grow at three times the rate of the U.S.
economy. Growth will be particularly powerful in
many emerging markets. If we do not seize these
opportunities, our competitors surely will. We must
continue working hard to secure and enforce
agreements that protect intellectual property rights
and enable Americans to compete fairly in foreign
markets.

Trade agreement implementing authority is essential
for advancing our nation’s economic interests. Con-
gress has consistently recognized that the President
must have the authority to break down foreign trade
barriers and create good jobs. Accordingly, the
Administration will work with Congress to fashion an
appropriate grant of fast track authority.

The Administration will continue to press our trading
partners—multilaterally, regionally and bilaterally—to
expand export opportunities for U.S. workers, farmers
and companies. We will position ourselves at the
center of a constellation of trade relationships—such
as the World Trade Organization, APEC, the
Transatlantic Marketplace and the Free Trade Area of
the Americas (FTAA). We will seek to negotiate
agreements, especially in sectors where the U.S. is
most competitive—as we did in the Information

 

Technology Agreement and the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Financial Services and
Telecommunications Services Agreements. As we
look ahead to the next WTO Ministerial meeting, to
be held in the United States in late 1999, we will
aggressively pursue an agenda that addresses U.S.
trade objectives. We will also remain vigilant in
enforcing the trade agreements reached with our
trading partners. That is why the U.S. Trade
Representative and the Department of Commerce
created offices in 1996 dedicated to ensuring foreign
governments are fully implementing their
commitments under these agreements.

Promoting an Open Trading
System

The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of
negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade significantly strengthened the world trading
system. The U.S. economy is expected to gain over
$100 billion per year in GDP once the Uruguay Round
is fully implemented. The Administration remains
committed to carrying forward the success of the
Uruguay Round and to the success of the WTO as a
forum for openly resolving disputes.

We have completed the Information Technology

Agreement (ITA) which goes far toward eliminating
tariffs on high technology products and amounts to a

29

global annual tax cut of $5 billion. We look to
complete the first agreement expanding products
covered by the ITA in 1998. We also concluded a
landmark WTO agreement that will dramatically
liberalize world trade in telecommunications services.
Under this agreement, covering over 99 percent of
WTO member telecommunications revenues, a
decades old tradition of telecommunications
monopolies and closed markets will give way to
market opening deregulation and competition—
principles championed by the United States.

The WTO agenda includes further negotiations to
reform agricultural trade, liberalize service sector
markets, and strengthen protection for intellectual
property rights. At the May 1998 WTO Ministerial,
members agreed to initiate preparations for these
negotiations and to consider other possible
negotiating topics, including issues not currently
covered by WTO rules. These preparatory talks will
continue over the course of the next year so that the
next round of negotiations can be launched at the
1999 WTO ministerial meeting in the United States.

We also have a full agenda of accession negotiations
with countries seeking to join the WTO. As always,
the United States is setting high standards for
accession in terms of adherence to the rules and
market access. Accessions offer an opportunity to
help ground new economies in the rules-based
trading system and reinforce their own reform
programs. This is why we will take an active role in
the accession process dealing with the 32 applicants
currently seeking WTO membership.

Through Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) negotiations of a Multilateral
Agreement on Investment, we are seeking to establish
clear legal standards on expropriation, access to
binding international arbitration for disputes and
unrestricted investment-related transfers across
borders. Also in the OECD, the United States is taking
on issues such as corruption and labor practices that
can distort trade and inhibit U.S. competitiveness. We
seeking to have OECD members outlaw bribery of
foreign officials, eliminate the tax deductibility of foreign
bribes, and promote greater transparency in
government procurement. To date, our efforts on
procurement have been concentrated in the World
Bank and the regional development banks, but our
initiative to pursue an agreement on transparency in
WTO member procurement regimes should make an
additional important contribution. We have also made

30

 

important strides on labor issues. The WTO has
endorsed the importance of core labor standards
sought by the United States since the Eisenhower
Administration—the right to organize and bargain
collectively, and prohibitions against child labor and
forced labor. We will continue pressing for better
integration of the international core labor standards into
the WTO's work, including through closer WTO
interaction with the International Labor Organization
(ILO).

We continue to ensure that liberalization of trade does
not come at the expense of national security or
environmental protection. For example, the national
security, law enforcement and trade policy
communities worked together to make sure that the
WTO agreement liberalizing global investment in
telecommunications was consistent with U.S. national
security interests. Moreover, our leadership in the
Uruguay Round negotiations led to the incorporation of
environmental provisions into the WTO agreements
and creation of the Committee on Trade and
Environment, where governments continue to pursue
the goal of ensuring that trade and environment
policies are mutually supportive. In addition, with U.S.
leadership, countries participating in the Summit of the
Americas are engaged in sustainable development
initiatives to ensure that economic growth does not
come at the cost of environmental protection.

In May 1998, President Clinton presented to the WTO
a set of proposals to further U.S. international trade
objectives:

¢ First, that the WTO make further efforts to
eliminate trade barriers and pursue a more open
global trading system in order to spur economic
growth, better jobs, higher incomes, and the free
flow of ideas, information and people.

* Second, that the WTO provide a forum where
business, labor, environmental and consumer
groups can provide regular input to help guide
further evolution of the WTO. The trading system
we build for the 21st century must ensure that
economic competition does not threaten the
livelihood, health and safety of ordinary families
by eroding environmental and consumer
protection or labor standards.

¢ Third, that a high-level meeting of trade and
environmental officials be convened to provide
direction for WTO environmental efforts, and that

the WTO and the International Labor
Organization commit to work together to ensure
that open trade raises the standard of living for
workers and respects core labor standards.

* Fourth, that the WTO open its doors to the
scrutiny and participation of the public by taking
every feasible step to bring openness and
accountability to its operations, such as by
opening its dispute settlement hearings to the
public and making the briefs for those hearings
publicly available.

¢ Fifth, that the nations of the world join the United
States in not imposing any tariffs on electronic
commercial transmissions sent across national
borders. The revolution in information technology
represented by the Internet is the greatest force
for prosperity in our lifetimes; we cannot allow
discriminatory barriers to stunt the development
of this promising new economic opportunity. An
electronic commerce work program was agreed
to at the May 1998 WTO Ministerial. It will be
reviewed at the 1999 ministerial meeting.

¢ — Sixth, that all WTO members make government
purchases through open and fair bidding and
adopt the OECD antibribery convention.
Prosperity depends upon government practices
that are based upon the rule of law rather than
bureaucratic caprice, cronyism or corruption.

* Seventh, that the WTO explore a faster trade
negotiating process and develop an open trading
system that can change as fast as the global
marketplace. Positive steps include annual tariff
and subsidy reductions in agriculture, greater
openness and competition in the services sector,
further tariff reductions in the industrial sector,
and stronger intellectual property protection.

Export Strategy and Advocacy
Program

The Administration created America’s first national
export strategy, reforming the way government works
with the private sector to expand exports. The new
Trade Promotion Coordination Committee (TPCC) has
been instrumental in improving export promotion
efforts, coordinating our export financing, implementing
a government-wide advocacy initiative and updating

 

market information systems and product standards
education.

The export strategy is working, with the United States
regaining its position as the world’s largest exporter.
While our strong export performance has supported
millions of new, export-related jobs, we must export
more in the years ahead if we are to further strengthen
our trade balance position and raise living standards
with high-wage jobs. Our objective remains to expand
U.S. exports to over $1.2 trillion by the year 2000,
which will mean over 2.5 million new American jobs
and a total of over 14.6 million jobs supported by
exports.

Enhanced Export Control

The United States is a world leader in high technology
exports, including satellites, cellular phones,
computers and commercial aircraft. Some of this
technology has direct or indirect military applications.
For that reason, the United States government
carefully controls high technology exports through a
licensing process involving the Department of
Defense, the Department of State, the Commerce
Department and other agencies. Changes to U.S.
export controls over the last decade have allowed
America's most important growth industries to
compete effectively overseas and create good jobs at
home while ensuring that proper safeguards are in
place to protect important national security interests.

The cornerstone of our export control policy is
protection of our national security; but imposing the
tightest possible restrictions on high technology
exports is not always the best way to protect our
security. In an increasingly competitive global
economy, the United States retains a monopoly over
very few technologies. As a result, rigid export
controls increasingly would not protect our national
security because the same products can be obtained
readily from foreign sources. Rigid controls would
make U.S. high technology companies less competi-
tive globally, thus losing market share and becoming
less able to produce the innovative, cutting-edge
products for the U.S. military and our allies.

Our current policy—developed in the Reagan and
Bush Administrations and continued by President
Clinton—recognizes that we must balance a variety of
factors. In the wake of the Cold War, the Bush
Administration accelerated the process of moving the

31

licensing of essentially commercial items from the
State Department's Munitions List to the Commerce-
administered Commodity Control List in order to
promote high technology exports by making license
decisions more predictable and timely. In 1995, by
Executive Order, President Clinton expanded the right
of the Departments of Defense, State and Energy and
the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency to fully
participate in the decision-making process.
Previously, these agencies reviewed only certain
dual-use applications; as a result of the Executive
Order, they have the right to review every dual-use
application. If any of these agencies disagree with a
proposed export, it can block the license and put the
issue into a dispute resolution process that can
ultimately rise to the President. As a result, reviews
of dual-use licenses are today more thorough and
broadly based than ever before.

While our export controls and the regulations that
implement them have become easier for American
exporters to follow, we have also enhanced our ability
to identify, stop and prosecute those who attempt to
evade them. For example, in fiscal year 1997 efforts
of the Commerce Department's criminal investigators
led to over $1 million in criminal fines and over $16
million in civil penalties. We have significant
enforcement weapons to use against those who
would evade our export controls, and we are using
them vigorously.

Finally, U.S. efforts to stem proliferation cannot be
effective without the cooperation of other countries.
To that end, we have strengthened multilateral
cooperation through the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the
Missile Technology Control Regime, the Australia
Group (for the control of chemical and biological
weapons-related related items), the Chemical
Weapons Convention, and the Wassenaar
Arrangement, which through U.S. leadership is
shaping multilateral export controls for the next
century. These multilateral efforts enlist the world
community in the battle against the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, advanced conventional
weapons and sensitive technologies, while at the
same time producing a level playing field for U.S.
business by ensuring that our competitors face
corresponding export controls.

Providing for Energy Security

32

 

The United States depends on oil for about 40 percent
of its primary energy needs and roughly half of our oil
needs are met with imports. Although we import less
than 10% of Persian Gulf exports, our allies in Europe
and Japan account for about 85% of these exports,
thus underscoring the continued strategic importance
of the region. We are undergoing a fundamental shift
away from reliance on Middle East oil. Venezuela is
our number one foreign supplier and Africa supplies
15% of our imported oil. Canada, Mexico and
Venezuela combined supply more than twice as much
oil to the United States as the Arab OPEC countries.

The Caspian Basin, with potential oil reserves of 160
billion barrels, promises to play an increasingly
important role in meeting rising world energy demand
in coming decades. We have made it a priority to work
with the countries of the region to develop multiple
pipeline ventures that will ensure access to the oil. We
are also working on several fronts to enhance the
stability and safeguard the independence of these
nations. While these developments are significant, we
must remember that the vast majority of proven oil
reserves lie in the Middle East and that the global oil
market is largely interdependent.

Conservation measures and research leading to
great-er energy efficiency and alternative fuels are a
critical element of the U.S. strategy for energy
security. The U.S. economy has grown roughly 75
percent since the first oil shock in 1973. During that
time U.S. oil consumption remained virtually stable,
reflecting conservation efforts and increased energy
efficiency. Our research must continue to focus on
developing highly efficient transportation systems and
to shift them to alternative fuels, such as hydrogen,
ethanol or methanol from biomass, and others. This
research will also help address concerns about
climate change by providing new approaches for
meeting guidelines on emission of greenhouse gases.
Over the longer term, U.S. dependence on access to
foreign oil sources may be increasingly important as
domestic resources are depleted. Although U.S. oil
consumption has been essentially level since 1973, our
reliance on imported oil has increased due to a decline
in domestic production. Domestic oil production
declined during that period because oil prices were not
high enough to generate new oil exploration sufficient
to sustain production levels from our depleted resource
base. Conservation and energy research
notwithstand-ing, the United States will continue to
have a vital interest in ensuring access to foreign oil
sources. We must continue to be mindful of the need

for regional stability and security in key producing areas
to ensure our access to and the free flow of these
resources.

Promoting Sustainable
Development Abroad

Environmental and natural resource issues can
impede sustainable development efforts and promote
regional instability. Many nations are struggling to
provide jobs, education and other services to their
citizens. The continuing poverty of a quarter of the
world’s people leads to hunger, malnutrition, economic
migration and political unrest. Malaria, AIDS and other
epidemics, including some that can spread through
environmental damage, threaten to overwhelm the
health facilities of developing countries, disrupt
societies and stop economic growth.

Sustainable development improves the prospects for
democracy in developing countries and expands the
demand for U.S. exports. It alleviates pressure on
the global environment, reduces the attraction of the
illegal drug trade and other illicit commerce, and
improves health and economic productivity. U.S.
foreign assistance focuses on four key elements of
sustainable development: broad-based economic
growth, environmental security, population and
health, and democracy.

We will continue to advocate environmentally sound
private investment and responsible approaches by
international lenders. The multilateral development
banks are now placing increased emphasis upon
sustainable development in their funding decisions,
including assisting borrowing countries to better
manage their economies. The U.S. Initiative on Joint
Implementation, part of the Administration's Climate
Change Action Plan, encourages U.S. businesses and
non-governmental organizations to apply innovative
technologies and practices to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and promote sustainable development
abroad. The initiative, which includes 32 projects in 12
countries, has proven effective in transferring
technology for environmentally sound, sustainable
development. The Global Environmental Facility
provides a source of financial assistance to the
developing world for climate change, biodiversity and
oceans initiatives that will benefit all the world’s
citizens. Environmental damage in countries of the

 

NIS and Central and Eastern Europe continues to
impede their ability to emerge as

prosperous, independent countries. We are focusing
technical assistance and encouraging non-
governmental environmental groups to provide
expertise to the NIS and Central and Eastern European
nations that have suffered the most acute
environmental crises.

Promoting Democracy

The third core objective of our national security
strategy is to promote democracy and human rights.
The number of states moving away from repressive
governance toward democratic and publicly
accountable institutions is impressive. Since the
success of many of those changes is by no means
assured, our strategy must focus on strengthening their
commitment and institutional capacity to implement
democratic reforms.

Emerging Democracies

We seek international support in helping strengthen
democratic and free market institutions and norms in
countries making the transition from closed to open
societies. This commitment to see freedom and
respect for human rights take hold is not only just, but
pragmatic, for strengthened democratic institutions
benefit the United States and the world.

The United States is helping consolidate democratic
and market reforms in Central and Eastern Europe
and the NIS. Integrating the Central and Eastern
European nations into European security and
economic organizations, such as NATO and the EU,
will help lock in and preserve the impressive progress
these nations have made in instituting democratic and
market-economic reforms. Our intensified interaction
with Ukraine has helped move that country onto the
path of economic reform, which is critical to its long-
term stability. In addition, our efforts in Russia, Ukraine
and the other NIS facilitate our goal of achieving
continued reductions in nuclear arms and compliance
with international nonproliferation accords.

Continuing advances in democracy and free markets in
our own hemisphere remain a priority, as reflected by
the President's 1997 trips to Latin America and the
Caribbean and the Summit of the Americas in Santiago
this year. In the Asia Pacific region, economic

33

dynamism is increasingly associated with political
modernization, democratic evolution and the widening
of the rule of law—and it has global impacts. We are
particularly attentive to states whose entry into the
camp of market democracies may influence the future
direction of an entire region; South Africa now holds
that potential with regard to sub-Saharan Africa.

The methods for assisting emerging democracies are
as varied as the nations involved. We must continue
leading efforts to mobilize international economic and
political resources, as we have with Russia, Ukraine
and the other NIS. We must take firm action to help
counter attempts to reverse democracy, as we have in
Haiti and Paraguay. We must give democratic nations
the fullest benefits of integration into foreign markets,
which is part of the reason NAFTA and the Uruguay
Round of GATT ranked so high on our agenda and
why we are now working to forge the FTAA. We must
help these nations strengthen the pillars of civil society,
supporting administration of justice and rule of law
programs, assisting the development of democratic
civil-military relations, and training foreign police and
security forces to solve crimes and maintain order
without violating the basic rights of their citizens. And
we must seek to improve their market institutions and
fight corruption and political discontent by encouraging
good governance practices.

Adherence to Universal Human
Rights and Democratic Principles

We must sustain our efforts to press for political
liberalization and respect for basic human rights
worldwide, including in countries that continue to defy
democratic advances. Working bilaterally and
through multilateral institutions, the United States
promotes universal adherence to international human
rights and democratic principles. Our efforts in the
United Nations and other organizations are helping to
make these principles the governing standards for
acceptable international behavior.

We will also continue to work—bilaterally and with
multilateral institutions—to ensure that international
human rights principles protect the most vulnerable or
traditionally oppressed groups in the world—women,
children, workers, refugees and persons persecuted
on the basis of their religious beliefs or ethnic
descent. To this end, we will seek to strength-en and
improve the UN Human Rights Commission and other
international mechanisms that promote human rights

34

 

and address violations of international humanitarian
law, such as the international war crimes tribunals for
the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.

To focus additional attention on the more vulnerable or
traditionally oppressed people, we seek to spearhead
new international initiatives to combat the sexual
exploitation of minors, child labor, homelessness
among children, violence against women and children,
and female genital mutilation. We will continue to
work with individual nations, such as Russia and
China, and with international institutions to combat
religious persecution. We are encouraging
governments to not return people to countries where
they face persecution. We ask that they provide
asylum or offer temporary protection to persons
fleeing situations of conflict or generalized human
rights abuses. We seek to ensure that such persons
are not returned without due consideration of their
need for permanent protection.

Violence against women and trafficking in women and
girls is are international problem with national
implications. We have seen cases of trafficking in the
United States for purposes of forced prostitution,
sweatshop labor and domestic servitude. The United
States is committed to combating trafficking in
women and girls with a focus on the areas of
prevention, victim assistance and protection, and
enforcement. On March 11, 1998, President Clinton
directed a wide range of expanded efforts to combat
violence against women in the United States and
around the world, including efforts to increase
national and international awareness of trafficking in
women and girls. The President called for continued
efforts to fully implement the 1994 Violence Against
Women Act and restore its protection for immigrant
victims of domestic violence in the United States so
that they will not be forced to choose between
deportation and abuse. He also called upon the
Senate to give its advice and consent to ratification to
the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of
Discrimination Against Women, which will enhance
our efforts to combat violence against women, reform
unfair inheritance and property rights, and strengthen
women's access to fair employment and economic
opportunity.

The United States will continue to speak out against
human rights abuses and carry on human rights
dialogues with countries willing to engage us
constructively. Because police and internal security
services can be a source of human rights violations,

we use training and contacts between U.S. law
enforcement and their foreign counterparts to help
address these problems. Federal law enforcement
agents can serve as role models for investigators in
countries where the police have been instruments of
oppression and at the same time reduce international
crime and terrorism that affects U.S. interests. In
appropriate circumstances, we must be prepared to
take strong measures against human rights violators.
These include economic sanctions, as have been
maintained against Nigeria, Iraq, Burma, North Korea
and Cuba, visa restrictions and restricting sales of
arms and police equipment that may be used to
commit human rights abuses.

Humanitarian Activities

Our efforts to promote democracy and human rights
are complemented by our humanitarian programs,

 

which are designed to alleviate human suffering, help
establish democratic regimes that respect human
rights and pursue appropriate strategies for economic
development. These efforts also enable the United
States to help prevent humanitarian disasters with far
more significant resource implications.

We also must seek to promote reconciliation in states
experiencing civil conflict and to address migration and
refugee crises. To this end, the United States will
provide appropriate financial support and work with
other nations and international bodies, such as the
International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees. We also will assist
efforts to protect the rights of refugees and displaced
persons and to address the economic and social root
causes of internal displacement and international
flight. Finally, we will cooperate with other states to
curb illegal immigration into this country.

Private firms and associations are natural allies in
activities and efforts intended to bolster market
economies. We have natural partners in labor unions,
human rights groups, environmental advocates,
chambers of commerce and election monitors in
promoting democracy and respect for human rights
and in providing international humanitarian
assistance; thus, we should promote democratization
efforts through private and non-governmental groups
as well as foreign governments.

Supporting the global movement toward democracy
requires a pragmatic, long-term effort focused on both
values and institutions. Our goal is a broadening of the
community of free-market democracies and stronger
international non-governmental movements committed
to human rights and democratization.

35

Ill. Integrated Regional Approaches

Our policies toward different regions reflect our overall
strategy tailored to unique challenges and
opportunities.

Europe and Eurasia

European stability is vital to our own security. The
United States has two strategic goals in Europe. The
first is to build a Europe that is truly integrated,
democratic, prosperous and at peace. This would
complete the mission the United States launched 50
years ago with the Marshall Plan and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

Our second goal is to work with our allies and
partners across the Atlantic to meet the global
challenges no nation can meet alone. This means
working together to support peace efforts in troubled
regions, to counter global threats such as the spread
of weapons of mass destruction and dual-use
technology, and to build a more open world economy
and without barriers to transatlantic trade and
investment. We will continue to strengthen the
OSCE's role in conflict prevention and crisis
management and seek closer cooperation with our
European partners in dealing with non-military
security threats through our New Transatlantic
Agenda with the European Union (EU).

Enhancing Security

NATO remains the anchor of American engagement
in Europe and the linchpin of transatlantic security.
As a guarantor of European security and a force for
European stability, NATO must play a leading role in
promoting a more integrated and secure Europe,
prepared to respond to new challenges. We will
maintain approximately 100,000 military personnel in
Europe to fulfill our commitments to NATO, provide a
visible deterrent against aggression and coercion,
contribute to regional stability, respond to crises,

 

sustain our vital transatlantic ties and preserve U.S.
leadership in NATO.

NATO enlargement is a crucial element of the U.S.
and Allied strategy to build an undivided, peaceful
Europe. The end of the Cold War changed the
nature of the threats to this region, but not the fact
that Europe's stability is vital to our own national
security. The addition of well-qualified democracies,
which have demonstrated their commitment to the
values of freedom and the security of the broader
region, will help deter potential threats to Europe,
deepen the continent's stability, bolster its democratic
advances, erase its artificial divisions, and strengthen
an Alliance that has proven its effectiveness both
during and since the Cold War.

In December 1997, the NATO foreign ministers
signed the three protocols of accession for Poland,
Hungary, and the Czech Republic, making them full
members of the Alliance subject to ratification by all
current and incoming NATO members. On May 21,
1998, the President signed the instruments of
ratification for the three protocols following a strong,
bipartisan 80-19 vote of approval in the U.S. Senate.
Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will make
the Alliance stronger while helping to enlarge
Europe's zone of democratic stability. They have
been leaders in Central Europe's dramatic
transformation over the past decade and have helped
make Central Europe the continent's most robust
zone of economic growth. They will strengthen
NATO through the addition of military resources,
strategic depth and the prospect of greater stability in
Europe's central region. Our Alliance with them will
improve our ability to protect and advance our
interests in the transatlantic area and contribute to
our security in the years to come.

At the same time, we have vigorously pursued efforts
to help other countries that aspire to membership
become the best possible candidates. Together with
our Allies we are enhancing the Partnership for
Peace and continuing political contacts with aspiring

37

states. We are also continuing bilateral programs to
advance this agenda, such as the President's
Warsaw Initiative, which is playing a critical role in
helping the militaries of Central and Eastern Europe
and Eurasia become more interoperable with NATO.
Building on the increasing links between NATO and
the Partnership for Peace nations, Partners will
increasingly contribute to real-world NATO missions,
as many are doing in the NATO-led operation in
Bosnia.

Some European nations do not desire NATO
membership, but do desire strengthened ties with the
Alliance. The Partnership for Peace provides an
ideal venue for such relationships. It formalizes
relations, provides a mechanism for mutual beneficial
interaction and establishes a sound basis for
combined action should that be desired. For all these
reasons, Partnership for Peace will remain a central
and permanent part of the European security
architecture.

NATO also is pursuing several other initiatives to
enhance its ability to respond to new challenges and
deepen ties between the Alliance and Partner
countries. NATO has launched the Euro-Atlantic
Partnership Council to strengthen political dialogue
and practical cooperation with all Partners, and
established a NATO-Ukraine Charter, which provides
a framework for enhanced relations. As a result of
the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, NATO and
Russia developed the Permanent Joint Council to
enhance political consultation and practical
cooperation, while retaining NATO's decision-making
authority. Our shared goal remains constructive
Russian participation in the European security
system.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization will hold its
Fiftieth Anniversary summit meeting in Washington
on April 24-25, 1999. This summit will mark NATO's
extraordinary record of success over the past fifty
years in protecting the security of the United States
and our European allies. As agreed at the 1997
Madrid summit, we hope to use the upcoming summit
meeting in Washington to welcome the entry of
Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic as new
members of the alliance. Looking to the future, the
summit will advance the common work of NATO
allies and partners to build an undivided Europe that
is peaceful, prosperous, and democratic.

38

 

As we help build a comprehensive European security
architecture, we must continue to focus on regional
security challenges.

Southeastern Europe and the Balkans: There are
significant security challenges in Southeastern Europe.
Instability in this region could threaten the
consolidation of reforms, disrupt commerce and
undermine our efforts to bring peace to Bosnia and
other parts of the former Yugoslavia.

The United States has an abiding interest in peace
and stability in Bosnia because continued war in that
region threatens all of Europe's stability. Implemen-
tation of the Dayton Accords is the best hope for
creating a self-sustaining peace in Bosnia. NATO-led
forces are contributing to a secure environment in
Bosnia and providing essential support for the
broader progress we are making in implementing the
Dayton Accords. Further progress is necessary,
however, to create conditions that will allow
implementation to continue without a large military
presence. We are committed to full implementation
of the Dayton Accords and success in Bosnia. We
support the efforts of the International Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia and broader efforts to
promote justice and reconciliation in Bosnia.

We are deeply concerned about the ongoing
bloodshed in Kosovo, which threatens security and
stability throughout the Balkan region. We are firmly
convinced that the problems in Kosovo can best be
resolved through a process of open and
unconditional dialogue between authorities in
Belgrade and the Kosovar Albanian leadership. We
seek a peaceful resolution of the crisis that
guarantees restoration of human and political rights
which have been systematically denied the Kosovar
Albanian population since Belgrade withdrew
autonomy in 1989. In support of that objective,
NATO is reviewing options for deterring further
violence against the civilian population in Kosovo and
stabilizing the military situation in the region.

We are redoubling our efforts to advance the
integration of several new democracies in
Southeastern Europe (Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia
and the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia)
into the European mainstream. More specifically, the
President's Action Plan for Southeast Europe seeks
to promote further democratic, economic, and military

reforms in these countries, to encourage greater
regional cooperation, and to advance common
interests, such as closer contact with NATO, and
increased law enforcement training and exchanges to
assist in the fight against organized crime.

Tensions on Cyprus, Greek-Turkish disagreements in
the Aegean and Turkey's relationship with the EU have
serious implications for regional stability and the
evolution of European political and security structures.
Our goals are to stabilize the region by reducing long-
standing Greek-Turkish tensions and pursuing a
comprehensive settlement on Cyprus. A democratic,
secular, stable and Western-oriented Turkey is critical
to these efforts and has supported broader U.S. efforts
to enhance stability in Bosnia, the NIS and the Middle
East, as well as to contain Iran and Iraq.

The Baltic States: For over fifty years, the United
States has recognized the sovereignty and
independence of the republics of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania. During this period, we never
acknowledged their forced incorporation into the
Soviet Union. The special nature of our relationship
with the Baltic States is recognized in the Charter of
Partnership signed on January 16, 1998, which
clarifies the principles upon which U.S. relations with
the Baltic states are based and provides a framework
for strengthening ties and pursuing common goals.
These goals include integration of Latvia, Lithuania
and Estonia into the transatlantic community and
development of close, cooperative relationships
among all the states in Northeastern Europe. The
Charter also establishes mechanisms for high-level
review and adjustment of this cooperation.

Northern Ireland: After a 30-year winter of sectarian
violence, Northern Ireland has the promise of a
springtime of peace. The agreement that emerged
from the Northern Ireland peace talks on April 10,
1998 opened the way to build a society based on
enduring peace, justice and equality. On May 22,
1998, the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland
seized this opportunity to turn the common tragedy of
Northern Ireland's past into a shared triumph for the
future by strongly endorsing the peace accord. Inso
doing, they have written a new chapter in the rich
history of their island by creating the best chance for
peace in a generation.

The United States actively promoted this peace
process and will continue to stand with those who

 

seek to build lasting peace and enduring prosperity in
Ireland and Northern Ireland. They can count on the
continuing aid, support and encouragement of the
United States. The task of making the peace endure
will be difficult. Some may seek to undermine this
agreement by returning to violence. Anyone who
does so, from whatever side and whatever faction,
will have no friends in America. We will work closely
with British and Irish law enforcement and
intelligence officials to prevent outrages before they
happen by identifying terrorists and their sources of
financial and material support.

We will continue to work with Northern Ireland’s
leaders as they seek to transform the promise of the
Accord into a reality—with new democratic
institutions and new economic opportunities for all of
Northern Ireland’s people. Working through the
International Fund for Ireland and the private sector,
we will help the people seize the opportunities that
peace will bring to attract new investment to create
new factories, workplaces and jobs, and establish
new centers of learning to prepare for the 21st
Century.

Newly Independent States (NIS): The United States
is pursuing a wide range of security objectives in the
NIS. We seek to bring Russia, Ukraine and the other
NIS into a new, cooperative European security order,
which includes strengthening their participation in
NATO Partnership for Peace activities and building
effective NATO-Russia and NATO-Ukraine
partnerships. We seek to reduce the threat of nuclear
war and the spread of nuclear weapons and materials,
as well as other weapons of mass destruction and their
delivery systems, especially to outlaw states.

The United States has vital security interests in the
evolution of Russia, Ukraine and the other NIS into
democratic market economies, peacefully and
prosperously integrated into the world community. The
governmental and financial sectors in this region
appear especially susceptible to penetration by
organized criminal groups, who have the ability to
subvert and destroy these nascent institutions.
Further democratic and economic reforms and
integration into the WTO and other international
economic institutions will strengthen the rule of law and
respect for human rights, foster growth by expanding
private sector activity, and encourage open and
cooperative policies toward the global community.

39

Promoting Prosperity

Europe is a key element in America’s global
commercial engagement. Europe and the United
States produce over half of all global goods and
services. More than 60% of total U.S. investment
abroad is in Europe and fourteen million workers on
both sides of the Atlantic earn their livelihoods directly
from transatlantic commerce. As part of the New
Transatlantic Agenda launched at the 1995 U.S.-EU
Summit in Madrid, the United States and the EU
agreed to take concrete steps to reduce barriers to
trade and investment through the creation of an open
New Transatlantic Marketplace. We have concluded
Mutual Recognition Agreements eliminating redundant
testing and certification requirements covering $50
billion in two-way trade. Our governments are also
cooperating closely with the Transatlantic Business
Dialogue, a U.S.-European business partnership, to
address a wide range of trade barriers.

Building on the New Transatlantic Agenda, the United
States and the EU launched the Transatlantic
Economic Partnership on May 18, 1998. This is a
major new initiative to deepen our economic
relations, reinforce our political ties and reduce trade
frictions that have plagued our bilateral relationship.
The first element of the initiative is reducing barriers
that affect manufacturing, agriculture and services.

In the manufacturing area we will focus on standards
and technical barriers that American businesses have
identified as the most significant obstacle to
expanding trade. In the agricultural area we will
focus on regulatory barriers that have inhibited the
expansion of agriculture trade, particularly in the
biotechnology area. In the area of services we will
seek to open our markets further and to create new
opportunities for the number of service industries that
are so active in the European market.

The second element of the Transatlantic Economic
Partnership is a broader, cooperative approach to
addressing a wide range of trade issues. We agreed
to maintain current practices, and will continue not
imposing duties on electronic transmissions and
develop a work program in the WTO for electronic
commerce. We will seek to adopt common positions
and effective strategies for accelerating compliance
with WTO commitments on intellectual property. We
will seek to promote government procurement
opportunities, including promoting compatibility of
electronic procurement information and government

40

 

contracting systems. We will seek innovative ways to
promote our shared labor and environmental values
around the world. To promote fair competition, we
will seek to enhance the compatibility of our
procedures with potentially significant reductions in
cost for American companies.

The United States strongly supports the process of
European integration embodied in the EU. We are also
encouraging bilateral trade and investment in non-EU
countries and supporting enlargement of the EU. We
recognize that EU nations face significant economic
challenges with nearly 20 million people unemployed,
and that economic stagnation has eroded public
support for funding outward-looking foreign policies
and greater integration. We are working closely with
our European partners to expand employment,
promote long-term growth and support the New
Transatlantic Agenda.

By supporting historic market reforms in Central and
Eastern Europe and in the NIS, we both strengthen
our own economy and help new democracies take
root. Poland, economically troubled as recently as
1989, now symbolizes the new dynamism and rapid
growth that extensive, free-market reforms make
possible. Recent economic turbulence in Russia
demonstrates that the transition to a more
prosperous, market-based economy will be a long-
term process characterized by promise and
disappointment. In Ukraine, reinvigorating economic
reform remains a key challenge to strengthening
national security and independence. Much remains
to be done throughout the region to assure
sustainable economic recoveries and adequate social
protection.

The United States will continue helping the NIS
economies integrate into international economic and
other institutions and develop healthy business
climates. We will continue to mobilize the
international community to provide assistance to
support reform. The United States is working closely
with Russia and Ukraine in priority areas, including
defense conversion, the environment, trade and
investment, and scientific and technological
cooperation. We are also encouraging investment,
especially by U.S. companies, in NIS energy resources
and their export to world markets, thereby expanding
and diversifying world energy supplies and promoting
prosperity in the NIS.

Ultimately, the success of economic and financial
reforms in the countries recently emerged from
communism will depend more on private investment
than official aid. One of our priorities, therefore, is to
help countries stimulate foreign and domestic
investment. At the Helsinki Summit, Presidents
Clinton and Yeltsin defined an ambitious reform
agenda covering key tax, energy and commercial
laws crucial for Russia to realize its potential for
attracting foreign investment. Further, the Presidents
outlined steps to accelerate Russian membership on
commercial terms in key economic organizations
such as the WTO. It is in both Russia’s interest and
ours that we work with Russian leaders on passage
of key economic and commercial legislation. We are
cooperating with Russia to facilitate oil and gas
exports to and through Russia from neighboring
Caspian countries. We also support development of
new East-West oil and gas export routes across the
Caspian Sea and through the Transcaucasus and
Turkey.

Ukraine is at an important point in its economic
transition—one that will affect its integration with
Europe and domestic prosperity. The United States
has mobilized the international community's support
for Ukrainian economic reform, pushed to improve
Ukraine's investment climate, and championed its
integration into key European, transatlantic and
global economic institutions. Two other challenges
stand out: first, to instill respect for the rule of law so
that a more transparent, level economic playing field
is established and democratic governance prevails;
and, second, to gain international support as it seeks
to close down Chernobyl and reform its energy
sector. The U.S.-Ukraine Binational Commission,
chaired by Vice President Gore and President
Kuchma, serves as a focal point to coordinate
bilateral relations and to invigorate Ukrainian reform
efforts.

A stable and prosperous Caucasus and Central Asia
will help promote stability and security from the
Mediterranean to China and facilitate rapid develop-
ment and transport to international markets of the
large Caspian oil and gas resources, with substantial
U.S. commercial participation. While the new states
in the region have made progress in their quest for
sovereignty and a secure place in the international
arena, much remains to be done in democratic and
economic reform and in settling regional conflicts,
such as Nagorno-Karabakh and Abkhazia.

 

Promoting Democracy

Thoroughgoing democratic and economic reforms in
the NIS and Europe’s former communist states are the
best measures to avert conditions which could foster
aggressive nationalism and ethnic hatreds. Already,
the prospect of joining or rejoining the Western
democratic family has dampened the forces of
nationalism and strengthened the forces of democracy
and reform in many countries of the region.

The independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and
democratic and economic reform of the NIS are
important to American interests. To advance these
goals, we are utilizing our bilateral relationships, our
leadership of international institutions, and billions of
dollars in private and multilateral resources. But the
circumstances affecting the smaller countries depend
in significant measure on the fate of reform in the
largest and most powerful—Russia. The United States
will continue vigorously to promote Russian reform and
international integration, and discourage any reversal in
the progress that has been made. Our economic and
political support for the Russian government depends
on its commitment to internal reform and a responsible
foreign policy.

East Asia and the Pacific

President Clinton’s vision of a new Pacific community
links security interests with economic growth and our
commitment to democracy and human rights. We
continue to build on that vision, cementing America’s
role as a stabilizing force in a more integrated Asia
Pacific region.

Enhancing Security

Our military presence has been essential to
maintaining the stability that has enabled most nations
in the Asia Pacific region to build thriving economies for
the benefit of all. To deter aggression and secure our
own interests, we will maintain approximately 100,000
U.S. military personnel in the region. Our commitment
to maintaining an active military presence in the region
and our treaty alliances with Japan, South Korea,
Australia, Thailand and the Philippines serve as the
foundation for America’s continuing security role.

41

We are maintaining healthy relations with the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
which now includes Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos and
Burma. We are also supporting regional dialogue—
such as in the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)—on
the full range of common security challenges. By
meeting on confidence-building measures such as
search and rescue cooperation and peacekeeping, the
ARF can help enhance regional security and
understanding.

Japan

The United States and Japan reaffirmed our bilateral
security relationship in the April 1996 Joint Security
Declaration. The alliance continues to be the
cornerstone for achieving common security
objectives and for maintaining a stable and
prosperous environment for the Asia Pacific region as
we enter the twenty-first century. In September
1997, both Governments issued the revised
Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation
which will result in greater bilateral cooperation in
peacekeeping and humanitarian relief operations, in
situations in areas surrounding Japan, and in the
defense of Japan itself. The revised Guidelines, like
the U.S.-Japan security relationship itself, are not
directed against any other country.

In April 1998, in order to support the new Guidelines,
both governments agreed to a revised Acquisition
and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) which
expands the exchange of provision of supplies and
services to include reciprocal provision of logistics
support during situations surrounding Japan that
have an important influence on Japan’s peace and
security. While the guidelines and its related efforts
have specifically focused on regional security, both
countries have continued to cooperate in the
implementation of the Special Action Committee on
Okinawa (SACO) Final report. This effort initiated
plans and measures to realign, consolidate, and
reduce U.S. facilities and areas in Okinawa in order
to ease the impact of U.S. Forces’ presence on the
people of Okinawa. Implementation of SACO will
ultimately aid in ensuring the maintenance of U.S.
operational capabilities and force presence in the
Asia-Pacific region.

U.S.-Japan security cooperation extends to
promoting regional peace and stability, seeking

42

 

universal adherence to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, and addressing the dangers posed by
transfers of destabilizing conventional arms and
sensitive dual-use goods and technologies. Our
continued progress in assisting open trade between
our countries and our broad-ranging international
cooperation, exemplified by the Common Agenda,
provide a sound basis for our relations into the next
century.

Korean Peninsula

Tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain the
principal threat to peace and stability in East Asia.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
has publicly stated a preference for peaceful
reunification, but continues to dedicate a large portion
of dwindling resources to enhance the combat
capability of its huge military forces. Renewed
conflict has been prevented since 1953 bya
combination of the Armistice Agreement, which
brought an end to open hostilities; the United Nations
Command, which has visibly represented the will of
the UN Security Council to secure peace; and the
physical presence of U.S. and ROK troops in the
Combined Forces Command, which has
demonstrated the alliance’s resolve.

The inauguration of Kim Dae-jung as President of the
Republic of Korea on February 25, 1998 marked an
important turning point on the Korean Peninsula. It
marked the triumph of democracy in South Korea and
the first peaceful transition of power from the ruling
party to an opposition party. It was also a remarkable
triumph for President Kim, who had been denied the
Presidency in 1971 by voter intimidation and fraud,
kidnapped and almost murdered by government
agents, sentenced to death in 1991, imprisoned for
six years and in exile or under house arrest for over
ten years. President Kim personifies the victory of
democracy over dictatorship in South Korea.

President Kim has set a new course toward peace
and stability on the Korean Peninsula by opening
new channels for dialogue and seeking areas for
cooperation between North and South. During their
summit meeting in June 1998, President Clinton and
President Kim discussed the situation on the Korean
Peninsula, reaffirming South Korea's role as lead
interlocutor with the North Koreans and the
importance of our strong defense alliance. President
Clinton expressed strong support for President Kim's

vision of engagement and efforts toward
reconciliation with the North. The United States is
working to create conditions of stability by maintaining
solidarity with our South Korean ally, emphasizing
America’s commitment to shaping a peaceful and
prosperous Korean Peninsula and ensuring that an
isolated and struggling North Korea does not opt for a
military solution to its political and economic problems.

Peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict with a non-
nuclear, reunified peninsula will enhance stability in the
East Asian region and is clearly in our strategic interest.
We are willing to improve bilateral political and
economic ties with North Korea—consistent with the
objectives of our alliance with the ROK—to draw the
North into more normal relations with the region and
the rest of the world. Our willingness to improve
bilateral relations will continue to be commensurate
with the North's cooperation in efforts to reduce
tensions on the peninsula. South Korea has set a
shining example for nonproliferation by forswearing
nuclear weapons, accepting safeguards, and
developing a peaceful nuclear program that brings
benefits to the region. We are firm that North Korea
must freeze and dismantle its graphite-moderated
reactors and related facilities and fully comply with its
NPT obligations under the Agreed Framework. We
also seek to cease North Korea's chemical and
biological weapon programs and ballistic missile
proliferation activities. The United States, too, must
fulfill its obligations under the Agreed Framework and
the Administration will work with the Congress to
ensure the success of our efforts to address the North
Korean nuclear threat. The North must also engage in
a productive dialogue with South Korea; continue the
recently revived United Nations Command-Korean
People's Army General Officer Dialogue talks at
Panmunrjon; participate constructively in the Four Party
Talks among the United States, China, and North and
South Korea to reduce tensions and negotiate a peace
agreement; and support our efforts to recover the
remains of American servicemen missing since the
Korean War.

China

A stable, open, prosperous People's Republic of
China (PRC) that assumes its responsibilities for
building a more peaceful world is clearly and
profoundly in our interests. The prospects for peace
and prosperity in Asia depend heavily on China’s role
as a responsible member of the international

 

community. China’s integration into the international
system of rules and norms will influence its own
political and economic development, as well as its
relations with the rest of the world. Our relationship
with China will in large measure help to determine
whether the 21st century is one of security, peace,
and prosperity for the American people. Our success
in working with China as a partner in building a stable
international order depends on establishing a
productive relationship that will build sustained
domestic support.

Our policy toward China is both principled and
pragmatic: expanding our areas of cooperation while
dealing forthrightly with our differences. Seeking to
isolate China is clearly unworkable. Even our friends
and allies around the world would not support us; we
would succeed only in isolating ourselves and our
own policy. More importantly, choosing isolation over
engagement would not make the world safer. It
would make it more dangerous. It would undermine
rather than strengthen our efforts to foster stability in
Asia and halt the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. It would hinder the cause of democracy
and human rights in China, set back worldwide efforts
to protect the environment, and cut off one of the
world's most important markets.

President Jiang Zemin's visit to the United States in
October 1997—the first state visit by the President of
China to the United States in twelve years—marked
significant progress in the development of U.S.-PRC
relations. President Clinton's reciprocal visit to
Beijing in June 1998—the first state visit by an
American president to China in this decade—further
expanded and strengthened our relations. The two
summits were important milestones toward building a
constructive U.S.-China strategic partnership.

In their 1997 summit, the two Presidents agreed ona
number of steps to strengthen cooperation in
international affairs: establishing a Washington-
Beijing presidential communications link to facilitate
direct contact, regular presidential visits to each
other's capitals, and regular exchanges of visits by
cabinet and sub-cabinet officials to consult on
political, military, security and arms control issues.
They agreed to establish a consultation mechanism
to strengthen military maritime safety—which will
enable their maritime and air forces to avoid
accidents, misunderstandings or miscalculations—
and to hold discussions on humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief. In their June 1998 meeting, they

43

agreed to continue their regular summit meetings and
to intensify the bilateral dialogue on security issues.

Arms control and non-proliferation issues were high
on the agenda for 1998 summit, which expanded and
strengthened the series of agreements that were
reached at the 1997 summit. In Beijing, Presidents
Clinton and Jiang announced that the United States
and China will not target their strategic nuclear
weapons at each other. They confirmed their
common goal to halt the spread of weapons of mass
destruction. We welcomed China’s statement that it
attaches importance to issues related to the Missile
Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and missile
nonproliferation and that it has begun to actively
study joining the MTCR. Our two nations will
continue consultations on MTCR issues in 1998.
Both sides agreed to further strengthen controls on
the export of dual-use chemicals and related
production equipment and technology to assure they
are not used for production of chemical weapons,
and China announced that it has expanded the list of
chemical precursors which it controls. The two
Presidents issued a joint statement calling for
strengthening of the Biological Weapons Convention
and early conclusion of a protocol establishing a
practical and effective compliance mechanism and
improving transparency. They issued a joint
statement affirming their commitment to ending the
export and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel
landmines and to accelerating global humanitarian
demining. We also reached agreement with China
on practices for end-use visits on U.S. high
technology exports to China, which will establish a
framework for such exports to China.

China is working with the United States on important
regional security issues. In June 1998, China chaired
a meeting of the permanent members of the UN
Security Council to forge a common strategy for
moving India and Pakistan away from a nuclear arms
race. China condemned both countries for
conducting nuclear tests and joined us in urging them
to conduct no more tests, to sign the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, to avoid deploying or testing
missiles, and to work to resolve their differences
through dialogue. At the 1998 summit, Presidents
Clinton and Jiang issued a joint statement on their
shared interest in a peaceful and stable South Asia
and agreed to continue to coordinate their efforts to
strengthen peace and stability in that region. On the
Korean Peninsula, China has become a force for
peace and stability, helping us to convince North

44

 

Korea to freeze its dangerous nuclear program,
playing a constructive role in the four-party peace
talks.

The United States and China are working to
strengthen cooperation in the field of law
enforcement and mutual legal assistance, including
efforts to combat international organized crime,
narcotics trafficking, alien smuggling, illegal
immigration, counterfeiting and money laundering.
We have established a joint liaison group for law
enforcement cooperation and assigned
counternarcotics officers to each other’s embassies in
1998.

Our key security objectives for the future include:

* sustaining the strategic dialogue begun by
the recent summits and other high-level
exchanges;

* enhancing stability in the Taiwan Strait
through peaceful approaches to cross-Strait
issues and encouraging dialogue between
Beijing and Taipei;

* — strengthening China’s adherence to
international nonproliferation norms,
particularly in its export controls on ballistic
missile and dual use technologies;

* achieving greater openness and
transparency in China’s military;

* encouraging a constructive PRC role in
international affairs through active
cooperation in ARF, the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) and
the Northeast Asia Security Dialogue; and

* improving law enforcement cooperation with
PRC officials through increased liaison and
training.

Southeast Asia

Our strategic interest in Southeast Asia centers on
developing regional and bilateral security and
economic relationships that assist in conflict
prevention and resolution and expand U.S.
participation in the region’s economies. U.S. security
objectives in the region are to maintain our security

alliances with Australia, Thailand and the Philippines,
to sustain security access arrangements with
Singapore and other ASEAN countries, and to
encourage the emergence of a strong, cohesive
ASEAN capable of enhancing regional stability and
prosperity.

Our policy combines two approaches: First,
maintaining our increasingly productive relationship
with ASEAN—especially our security dialogue under
the ARF. Second, pursuing bilateral initiatives with
individual Southeast Asian nations to promote
political stability, foster market-oriented economic
reforms, and reduce or contain the effects of Asian
organized crime, particularly the flow of heroin from
Burma and other countries in the region.

Promoting Prosperity

A prosperous and open Asia Pacific is key to the
economic health of the United States. On the eve of
the recent financial problems in Asia, the 18
members of APEC contributed about one-half of total
global gross domestic product and exports. Thirty
percent of U.S. exports go to Asia, supporting
millions of U.S. jobs, and we export more to Asia than
Europe. In states like California, Oregon and
Washington, exports to Asia account for more than
half of each state's total exports. U.S. direct
investments in Asia represent about one-fifth of total
U.S. direct foreign investment.

Our economic objectives in East Asia include
recovery from the recent financial crisis, continued
progress within APEC toward liberalizing trade and
investment, increased U.S. exports to Asian countries
through market-opening measures and leveling the
playing field for U.S. business, and WTO accession
for China and Taiwan on satisfactory commercial
terms. Opportunities for economic growth abound in
Asia and underlie our strong commitment to
multilateral economic cooperation, such as via the
annual APEC leaders meetings.

Promoting sustainable development, protecting the
environment and coping with the global problem of
climate change are important for ensuring long-term
prosperity in the Asia Pacific region. The Kyoto
Agreement was a major step forward in controlling
the greenhouse gases that are causing climate
change, but its success depends on meaningful
participation by key developing nations as well as the

 

industrialized nations of the world. Rapid economic
growth in China and India make their participation
essential to the global effort to control greenhouse
gases.

The Asian Financial Crisis

Over the last decade, the global economy has
entered a new era—an era of interdependence and
opportunity. Americans have benefited greatly from
the worldwide increase of trade and capital flows.
This development has contributed to steady GNP
growth, improvements in standards of living, more
high paying jobs (particularly in export-oriented
industries), and low inflation.

The United States has enormously important
economic and national security interests at stake in
East Asia. Prolonged economic distress and
financial instability will have an adverse effect on U.S.
exports to the region, the competitiveness of
American companies, and the well being of American
workers. There also is a risk that if the current crisis
is left unchecked its effects could spread beyond
East Asia. Simply put, we cannot afford to stand
back in hopes that the crisis will resolve itself. When
we act to help resolve the Asian financial crisis, we
act to protect the well-being of the American people.

In the face of this challenge, our primary objective is
to help stabilize the current financial situation. Our
strategy has four key elements: support for economic
reforms; working with international financial
institutions to provide structural and humanitarian
assistance; providing bilateral humanitarian aid and
contingency bilateral financial assistance if needed;
and urging strong policy actions by Japan and the
other major economic powers to promote global
growth.

We will continue to support South Korea, Thailand
and Indonesia as they implement economic reforms
designed to foster financial stability and investor
confidence in order to attract the capital flows
required to restore economic growth. These reform
programs have at their core restructuring the financial
sector, promoting greater transparency in trade and
investment laws and regulations, and ending policy-
directed lending practices. All three nations face a
difficult road ahead that will test their political will.
The international community can continue to help
ameliorate adverse consequences of the crisis, but

45

only resolute action to keep to the agreed policy
course will bring a resumption of sustained growth.

Although the Asian financial crisis is having a crippling
effect, we believe the underlying fundamentals for
economic recovery are good and are confident that full
and vigorous implementation of economic reforms
combined with the efforts of the international
community will lead to the restoration of economic
growth to the countries of the region. U.S. initiatives in
APEC will open new opportunities for economic
cooperation and permit U.S. companies to expand their
involvement in substantial infrastructure planning and
construction throughout the region. While our progress
in APEC has been gratifying, we will explore options to
encourage all Asia Pacific nations to pursue open
markets.

The United States will continue to work with the IMF,
the World Bank, other international financial
institutions, the governments in East Asia and the
private sector to help stabilize financial markets,
restore investor confidence and achieve much-
needed reforms in the troubled East Asian
economies. Our goal is to help the region recover
quickly and to build a solid, resilient foundation for
future economic growth in the region.

China

Bringing the PRC more fully into the global trading
system is manifestly in our national interest. China is
one of the fastest growing markets for our goods and
services. As we look into the next century, our
exports to China will support hundreds of thousands
of jobs across our country. For this reason, we must
continue our normal trade treatment for China, as
every President has done since 1980, strengthening
instead of undermining our economic relationship.

An important part of integrating China into the market-
based world economic system is opening China’s
highly protected market through lower border barriers
and removal of distorting restraints on economic
activity. We have negotiated landmark agreements to
combat piracy of intellectual property and advance the
interests of our creative industries. We have also
negotiated—and vigorously enforced—agreements on
textile trade. At their 1997 and 1998 summits,
President Clinton and President Jiang agreed to take
a number of positive measures to expand U.S.-China
trade and economic ties. We will continue to press

46

 

China to open its markets (in goods, services and
agriculture) as it engages in sweeping economic
reform.

It is in our interest that China become a member of
the WTO; however, we have been steadfast in
leading the effort to ensure that China’s accession to
the WTO occurs on acommercial basis. China
maintains many barriers that must be eliminated, and
we need to ensure that necessary reforms are
agreed to before accession occurs. At the 1997
summit, the two leaders agreed that China’s full
participation in the multilateral trading system is in
their mutual interest. They agreed to intensify
negotiations on market access, including tariffs, non-
tariff measures, services, standards and agriculture,
and on implementation of WTO principles so that
China can accede to the WTO on a commercial basis
at the earliest possible date. They reiterated their
commitment to this process in their 1998 summit.

China has been a helpful partner in international
efforts to stabilize the Asian financial crisis. In
resisting the temptation to devalue its currency,
China has seen that its own interests lie in preventing
another round of competitive devaluations that would
have severely damaged prospects for regional
recovery. It has also contributed to the rescue
packages for affected economies.

Japan

The Administration continues to make progress on
increasing market access in Asia's largest economy.
Since the beginning of the first Clinton Administration,
the United States and Japan have reached 35 trade
agreements designed to open Japanese markets in
key sectors, including autos and auto parts,
telecommunications, civil aviation, insurance and
glass. The Administration also has intensified efforts
to monitor and enforce trade agreements with Japan
to ensure that they are fully implemented. The
United States also uses multilateral venues, such as
WTO dispute settlement and negotiation of new
multilateral agreements, to further open markets and
accomplish our trade objectives with Japan.

During the period from 1993 to 1996, U.S. exports to
Japan increased from $47.9 billion to $67.6 billion,
and the bilateral trade deficit fell from $59.4 billion to
$47.6 billion. The recent economic downturn in
Japan, however, has reversed this positive trend with

the bilateral trade deficit for the first four months 1998
already at $20.8 billion, up 32 percent from the same
period in 1996. Sustained global expansion and
recovery in Asia cannot be achieved when the
second largest economy in the world, accounting for
more than half of Asian output, is in recession and
has a weakened financial system.

Japan has a crucial role to play in Asia’s economic
recovery. Japan must generate substantial growth to
help maintain a growing world economy and absorb a
growing share of imports from emerging markets. To
do this Japan must reform its financial sector,
stimulate domestic demand, deregulate its economy,
and further open its markets to foreign goods and
services. We look forward to substantial and
effective actions to achieve a domestic demand-led
recovery, to restore health to the financial sector and
to make progress on deregulation and opening
markets. Strong, immediate, tangible actions by the
Japanese Government are vital to make Japan again
an engine of growth and to help spur a broader
economic recovery in Asia, as well as reinvigorate a
critical market for U.S. goods and services.

South Korea

At their summit meeting in June 1998, President
Clinton reaffirmed to President Kim that the United
States will continue its strong support for his efforts to
reform the Korean economy, liberalize trade and
investment, strengthen the banking system and
implement the IMF program. President Clinton
reiterated our commitment to provide bilateral finance
if needed under appropriate conditions. The two
presidents discussed a number of concrete steps to
promote growth in both our countries and explored
ways to more fully open our markets and to further
integrate the Republic of Korea into the global
economy, including new discussions on a bilateral
investment treaty. They also signed an Open Skies
agreement which permits unrestricted air service
between our two countries.

Thailand

Thailand, a key U.S. security partner in the region, also
faces serious economic difficulties. The U.S.
government continues to work with Thailand to ease

 

the strain of the financial crisis. We are taking concrete
steps to lessen the financial burden of military
programs, including decreasing the scope of military
contacts such as visits and exercises, and looking for
ways to reduce the impact of the crisis on security
assistance programs. The Royal Thai armed forces
have earned high marks for their stabilizing influence.

Promoting Democracy

Some have argued that democracy is unsuited for Asia
or at least for some Asian nations—that human rights
are relative and that Western support for international
human rights standards simply mask a form of cultural
imperialism. The democratic aspirations and
achievements of the Asian peoples prove these
arguments incorrect. We will continue to support those
aspirations and to promote respect for human rights in
all nations. Each nation must find its own form of
democracy, and we respect the variety of democratic
institutions that have emerged in Asia. But there is
no cultural justification for tyranny, torture or denial of
fundamental freedoms. Our strategy includes efforts
to:

* pursue a constructive, goal-oriented approach to
achieving progress on human rights and rule of
law issues with China;

¢ foster a meaningful political dialogue between the
ruling authorities in Burma and the democratic
opposition;

* work with the new government of Indonesia to
promote improved respect for human rights,
strengthened democratic processes and an
internationally acceptable political solution in East
Timor;

* work with ASEAN to restore democracy to
Cambodia and encourage greater respect for
human rights; and

* achieve the fullest possible accounting of missing
U.S. service members, promote greater respect
for human rights in Vietnam, and press for full
Vietnamese implementation of the Resettlement
Opportunity for Vietnamese Returnees (ROVR)
program.

47

The Western Hemisphere

Our hemisphere enters the twenty-first century with an
unprecedented opportunity to secure a future of
stability and prosperity—building on the fact that every
nation in the hemisphere except Cuba is democratic
and committed to free market economies. The end of
armed conflict in Central America and other
improvements in regional security have coincided with
remarkable political and economic progress throughout
the Americas. The people of the Americas are already
taking advantage of the vast opportunities being
created as emerging markets are connected through
electronic commerce and as robust democracies allow
individuals to more fully express their preferences.
Sub-regional political, economic and security
cooperation in North America, the Caribbean, Central
America, the Andean region and the Southern Cone
have contributed positively to peace and prosperity
throughout the hemisphere. Equally important, the
people of the Americas have reaffirmed their
commitment to combat together the difficult new threats
of narcotics and corruption. U.S. strategy is to secure
the benefits of the new climate in the hemisphere while
safeguarding the United States and our friends against
these threats.

The 1994 Summit of the Americas in Miami produced
hemispheric agreement to negotiate the Free Trade
Area of the Americas (FTAA) and agreements on
measures that included continued economic reform
and enhanced cooperation on issues such as the
environment, counternarcotics, money laundering
and corruption. Celebrating the region’s embrace of
democracy and free markets, that historic meeting
committed the United States to a more cooperative
relationship with the hemisphere. U.S. agencies
have used the Miami Summit Action Plan to establish
productive relationships and strengthen cooperation
with their Latin American and Caribbean counterparts
in a host of areas.

Our engagement with the hemisphere reached
unprecedented levels in 1997 and 1998. In May
1997, President Clinton traveled to Mexico for a
summit meeting with President Zedillo, then held
summits with Central American leaders in Costa Rica
and Caribbean leaders in Barbados, highlighting the
importance of working with our neighbors to solve
problems of great concern to Americans such as
drugs, immigration and transnational crime. In
October 1997, in Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina,

48

 

the President underscored opportunities for
cooperation with vibrant democracies and their fast
growing markets.

This substantial engagement with the hemisphere at
the beginning of the President's second term
continued at the Second Summit of the Americas in
Santiago, Chile in April 1998. At the Summit, the
leaders of the hemisphere focused on the areas
needed to prepare our citizens for the 21"" century:
education, democracy, economic integration and
poverty relief.

Enhancing Security

The principal security concerns in the hemisphere are
transnational in nature, such as drug trafficking,
organized crime, money laundering, illegal
immigration, and terrorism. In addition, our
hemisphere is leading the way in recognizing the
dangers to democracy produced by corruption and
rule of law issues. These threats, especially narcotics,
produce adverse social effects that undermine the
sovereignty, democracy and national security of
nations in the hemisphere.

We are striving to eliminate the scourge of drug
trafficking in our hemisphere. At the Santiago Summit,
the assembled leaders launched a Multilateral
Counterdrug Alliance to better organize and
coordinate efforts in the hemisphere to stem the
production and distribution of drugs. The centerpiece
of this alliance will be a mechanism to evaluate each
member country’s progress in achieving their agreed
counternarcotics goals. Summit leaders also agreed
to improve cooperation on extraditing and
prosecuting individuals charged with narcotics
trafficking and related crimes; strengthen efforts
against money laundering and forfeiture of assets
used in criminal activity; reinforce international and
national mechanisms to halt illicit traffic and diversion
of chemical precursors; enhance national programs
for fostering greater awareness of the dangers of
drug abuse, preventing illicit drug consumption and
providing treatment, rehabilitation and reintegration;
and eliminate illicit crops through national alternative
development programs, eradication and interdiction.

We are also pursuing a number of bilateral and
regional counternarcotics initiatives. As part of our
partnership with Mexico, we are striving to increase
counterdrug and law enforcement cooperation, while in

the Caribbean we are intensifying a coordinated effort
on counternarcotics and law enforcement. The
reduction in trade barriers resulting from the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) allows more
inspection resources to be directed to thwarting
attempts by organized crime to exploit the expanding
volume of trade for increased drug smuggling.

The Santiago Summit addressed other transnational
security concerns as well. Summit leaders called for
the rapid ratification and entry into force of the 1997
Inter-American Convention to Combat the Illicit
Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms,
Ammunition Explosives and Related Material. They
also agreed to encourage states to accede to the
international conventions related to terrorism and
convene, under the auspices of the OAS, the Second
Specialized Inter-American Conference to evaluate
the progress attained and to define future courses of
action for the prevention, combat and elimination of
terrorism.

We are advancing regional security cooperation
through bilateral security dialogues, multilateral efforts
in the Organization of American States (OAS) and
Summit of the Americas on transparency and regional
confidence and security building measures, exercises
and exchanges with key militaries (principally focused
on peacekeeping), and regular Defense Ministerials.
Working with Argentina, Brazil and Chile, the other
three guarantor nations of the Peru-Ecuador peace
process, the United States has brought the parties
closer to a permanent solution to this decades-old
border dispute, the resolution of which is important to
regional stability. The Military Observer Mission,
Ecuador-Peru (MOMEP), composed of the four
guarantor nations, successfully separated the warring
factions, created the mutual confidence and security
among the guarantor nations. The U.S. sponsored
multilateral military exercise focused on combating
drug trafficking, supporting disaster relief (particularly
important because of the El Nino phenomenon) and
participation in international peacekeeping. It has
spurred unprecedented exercises among neighboring
countries in Central America and the Southern Cone.
Additionally, the Southern Cone has increasingly
shared the burden of international peacekeeping
operations. The Santiago Summit tasked the OAS to
expand topics relating to confidence and security
building measures with the goal of convening a
Special Conference on Security by the beginning of
the next decade. Several countries in the region
have joined our call to promote transparency by

 

publishing white papers on defense. Our efforts to
encourage multilateral cooperation are enhancing
confidence and security within the region and will
help expand our cooperative efforts to combat the
transnational threats to the Western Hemisphere,
particularly in Columbia where social, political and
criminal violence is spilling across borders. We are
also working to ensure successful transfer of
stewardship of the Panama Canal to the Panamanian
people.

In light of the advances in democratic stability
throughout Latin America and mindful of the need for
restraint, the Administration has moved to case-by-
case consideration of requests for advanced
conventional arms transfers, on par with other areas of
the world. Such requests will be reviewed in a way that
will serve our objectives of promoting defense
cooperation, restraint in arms acquisition and military
budgets, and an increased focus on peacekeeping,
counternarcotics efforts and disaster relief.

Promoting Prosperity

Economic growth and integration in the Americas will
profoundly affect the prosperity of the United States
in the 21° century. Latin America has become the
fastest growing economic region in the world and our
fastest growing export market. In 1998, our exports to
Latin America and the Caribbean are expected to
exceed those to the EU.

Building on the vision articulated at Miami in 1994
and the groundwork laid by trade ministers over the
last four years, the Santiago Summit launched formal
negotiations to initiate the FTAA by 2005. The
negotiations will cover a broad range of important
issues, including market access, investment,
services, government procurement, dispute
settlement, agriculture, intellectual property rights,
competition policy, subsidies, anti-dumping and
countervailing duties. A Committee on Electronic
Commerce will explore the implications of electronic
commerce for the design of the FTAA, anda
Committee on Civil Society will provide a formal
mechanism for labor, business, consumer,
environmental and other non-government
organizations to make recommendations on the
negotiations so that all citizens can benefit from
trade. Governments also will cooperate on promoting
core labor standards recognized by the International
Labor Organization.

49

We seek to advance the goal of an integrated
hemisphere of free market democracies by
consolidating NAFTA’s gains and obtaining
Congressional Fast Track trade agreement
implementing authority. Since the creation of NAFTA,
our exports to Mexico have risen significantly while the
Agreement helped stabilize Mexico through its worst
financial crisis in modern history. Considering that
Mexico has now become our second-largest export
market, it is imperative that its economy remain open to
the United States and NAFTA helps to ensure that.

We will continue working with Mexico and interested
private parties to continue the mutually beneficial trade
with our largest trading partner and neighbor to the
north, Canada. We are also committed to delivering on
the President’s promise to negotiate a comprehensive
free trade agreement with Chile because of its
extraordinary economic performance and its active role
in promoting hemispheric economic integration.

While we support the freer flow of goods and
investment, there is also reason to be sensitive to the
concerns of smaller economies during the period of
transition to the global economy of the 21° century.
To address this problem, and in light of the increased
competition NAFTA presents to Caribbean trade, we
will seek Congressional approval to provide
enhanced trade benefits under the Caribbean Basin
Initiative (CBI) to help prepare that region for
participation in the FTAA. With the assistance of
institutions such as OPIC, we will encourage the
private sector to take the lead in developing small
and medium-sized businesses in the Caribbean
through the increased flow of investment capital. We
must also encourage Caribbean countries and
territories to implement programs to attract foreign
and domestic investment.

At the Santiago Summit, the hemisphere's leaders
reaffirmed that all citizens must participate in the
opportunities and prosperity created by free market
democracy. They pledged to ensure access to
financial services for a significant number of the 50
million micro, small and medium size enterprises in
the hemisphere by the year 2000, to work with
multilateral institutions and regional organizations to
invest about $400-500 million over the next three
years, and to streamline and decentralize property
registration and titling procedures and assure access
to justice for the poor. Governments will enhance
participation by promoting core labor standards
recognized by the ILO, strengthening gender equity,
working to eliminate exploitative child labor,

50

 

negotiating a new Declaration of Principles on
Fundamental Rights of Workers, and promoting
education and training for indigenous populations.
To improve quality of life, Summit leaders pledged to
pursue elimination of measles by the year 2000 and
reduce the incidence of diseases such as pneumonia
and mumps by the year 2002, to strengthen regional
networks of health information such as through
telemedicine, to give highest priority to reducing
infant malnutrition, and to strengthen cooperation to
implement Santa Cruz Sustainable Development
Plan of Action.

Promoting Democracy

Many Latin American nations have made tremendous
advances in democracy and economic progress over
the last several years. But our ability to sustain the
hemispheric agenda depends in part on meeting the
challenges posed by weak democratic institutions,
persistently high unemployment and crime rates, and
serious income disparities. In some Latin American
countries, citizens will not fully realize the benefits of
political liberalization and economic growth without
regulatory, judicial, law enforcement and educational
reforms, as well as increased efforts to integrate all
members of society into the formal economy.

At the Santiago Summit, the hemisphere's leaders
reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening
democracy, justice and human rights. They agreed
to intensify efforts to promote democratic reforms at
the regional and local level, protect the rights of
migrant workers and their families, improve the
capabilities and competence of civil and criminal
justice systems, and encourage a strong and active
civil society. They pledged to promptly ratify the
Inter-American Convention Against Corruption to
strengthen the integrity of governmental institutions.
They supported the creation of a Special Rapporteur
for Freedom of Expression as part of the Inter-
American Commission for Human Rights. The
Rapporteur will help resolve human rights cases
involving the press and focus international attention
on attacks against the hemisphere’s emerging Fourth
Estate, as their investigative reporting provokes
increasing threats from drug traffickers and other
criminal elements. Summit leaders also agreed to
establish an Inter-American Justice Studies Center to
facilitate training of personnel, to exchange of
information and other forms of technical cooperation
to improve judicial systems, to end impunity, combat

corruption and provide protection from rising
domestic and international crime, and to create a
secure legal environment for trade and investment.

The hemisphere’s leaders agreed at the Santiago
Summit that education is the centerpiece of reforms
aimed at making democracy work for all the people of
the Americas. The Summit Action Plan adopted at
Santiago will build on the achievements of the 1994
Miami Summit. It will advance numerous cooperative
efforts based on the guiding principles of equity,
quality, relevance and efficiency. The Santiago
Plan's targets are to ensure by the year 2010 primary
education for 100% of children and access to quality
secondary education for at least 75% of young
people. The plan also includes solid commitments to
finance schools, textbooks, teacher training,
technology for education, to create education
partnerships between the public and private sectors,
to use technology to link schools across national
boundaries and to increase international exchanges
of students.

We are also seeking to strengthen norms for defense
establishments that are supportive of democracy,
transparency, respect for human rights and civilian
control in defense matters. Through continued
engagement with regional armed forces, facilitated by
our own modest military activities and presence in the
region, we are helping to transform civil-military
relations. Through initiatives such as the Defense
Ministerial of the Americas and the Center for
Hemispheric Defense Studies, we are increasing
civilian expertise in defense affairs and reinforcing the
positive trend in civilian control.

Haiti and Cuba are of special concern to the United
States. The restoration of democracy in Haiti remains
a positive example for the hemisphere. In Haiti we
continue to support respect for human rights and
economic growth by a Haitian government capable of
managing its own security and paving the way for a fair
presidential election in 2000. Our efforts to train law
enforcement officers in Haiti have transformed the
police from a despised and feared instrument of
repression to an accountable public safety agency.
We are committed to working with our partners in the
region and in the international community to meet the
challenge of institutionalizing Haiti's economic and
political development. Haiti will benefit from a
Caribbean-wide acceleration of growth and investment,

 

stimulated in part by enhancement of CBI benefits.
The United States remains committed to promoting a
peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba and
forestalling a mass exodus that would endanger the
lives of migrants and the security of our borders. While
maintaining pressure on the regime to make political
and economic reforms, we continue to encourage the
emergence of a civil society to assist the transition to
democracy when the change comes. In March 1998,
President Clinton announced a number of measures
designed to build on the success of the Pope’s January
1998 visit to Cuba, expand the role of the Catholic
Church and other elements of civil society, and
increase humanitarian assistance. As the Cuban
people feel greater incentive to take charge of their
own future, they are more likely to stay at home and
build the informal and formal structures that will make
transition easier. Meanwhile, we remain firmly
committed to bilateral migration accords that ensure
migration in safe, legal and orderly channels.

The Middle East,
Southwest and South Asia

The May 1998 Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests
clearly illustrate that a wide range of events in this
region can have a significant impact on key U.S.
security objectives. Choices made in the Middle East,
Southwest and South Asia will determine whether
terrorists operating in and from the region are denied
the support they need to perpetrate their crimes,
whether weapons of mass destruction will imperil the
region and the world, whether the oil and gas fields of
the Caucasus and Central Asia become reliable energy
sources, whether the opium harvest in Afghanistan is
eliminated, and whether a just and lasting peace can
be established between Israel and the Arab countries.

Enhancing Security

The United States has enduring interests in pursuing a
just, lasting and comprehensive Middle East peace,
ensuring the security and well-being of Israel, helping
our Arab friends provide for their security, and
maintaining the free flow of oil at reasonable prices.
Our strategy reflects those interests and the unique
characteristics of the region as we work to extend the
range of peace and stability.

51

The Middle East Peace Process

An historic transformation has taken place in the
political landscape of the Middle East: peace
agreements are taking hold, requiring concerted
implementation efforts. The United States—as an
architect and sponsor of the peace process—has a
clear national interest in seeing the process deepen
and widen to include all Israel’s neighbors. We will
continue our steady, determined leadership—standing
with those who take risks for peace, standing against
those who would destroy it, lending our good offices
where we can make a difference and helping bring the
concrete benefits of peace to people’s daily lives.
Future progress will require movement in the following
areas:

* continued Israeli-Palestinian engagement on
remaining issues in the Interim Agreement,
and negotiation of permanent status issues;

* resuming Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese
negotiations with the objective of achieving
peace treaties; and

* normalization of relations between Arab states
and Israel.

Southwest Asia

In Southwest Asia, the United States remains
focused on deterring threats to regional stability,
countering threats posed by WMD and protecting the
security of our regional partners, particularly from Iraq
and Iran. We will continue to encourage members of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to work closely on
collective defense and security arrangements, help
individual GCC states meet their appropriate defense
requirements and maintain our bilateral defense
agreements.

We will maintain an appropriate military presence in
Southwest Asia using a combination of ground, air
and naval forces. As a result of the confrontation
with Iraq in late 1997 and early 1998 over to Iraqi
interference with UN inspection teams, we increased
our continuous military presence in the Gulf to back
our on-going efforts to bring Iraq into compliance with
UN Security Council resolutions. Our forces in the
Gulf are backed by our ability to rapidly reinforce the
region in time of crisis, which we demonstrated
convincingly in late 1997 and early 1998. We remain

52

 

committed to enforcing the no-fly zones over northern
and southern Iraq, which are essential for implement-
ing the UN resolutions and preventing Saddam from
taking large scale military action against Kuwait or
the Kurd and Shia minorities in Iraq.

We would like to see Iraq’s reintegration into the
international community; however, we have made
clear that Iraq must comply with all relevant UN
Security Council resolutions. Saddam Hussein must
cease the cynical manipulation of UN humanitarian
programs and cooperate with Security Council
Resolution 1153, which authorizes increased
humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq. Iraq
must also move from its posture of deny, delay and
obscure to a posture of cooperation and compliance
with the UN Security Council resolutions designed to
rid Iraq of WMD and their delivery systems. Iraq
must also comply with the memorandum of
understanding reached with UN Secretary General
Kofi Annan in February 1998. Our policy is directed
not against the people of Iraq but against the
aggressive behavior of the government. Until that
behavior changes, our goal is containing the threat
Saddam Hussein poses to Iraq’s neighbors, the free
flow of Gulf oil and broader U.S. interests in the
Middle East.

Our policy toward Iran is aimed at changing the
behavior of the Iranian government in several key
areas, including its efforts to obtain weapons of mass
destruction and long-range missiles, its support for
terrorism and groups that violently oppose the peace
process, its attempts to undermine friendly
governments in the region, and its development of
offensive military capabilities that threaten our GCC
partners and the flow of oil.

There are signs of change in Iranian policies. In
December 1997, Iranian officials welcomed Chairman
Arafat to the Islamic Summit in Tehran and said that,
although they did not agree with the peace process,
they would not seek to impose their views and would
accept what the Palestinians could accept. In
January 1998, President Khatemi publicly denounced
terrorism and condemned the killing of innocent
Israelis. Iran's record in the war against drugs has
greatly improved and it has received high marks from
the UN for its treatment of more than two million Iraqi
and Afghan refugees. Iran is participating in
diplomatic efforts to bring peace and stability to
Afghanistan and is making a welcome effort to
improve relations with its neighbors in the Gulf.

We view these developments with interest, both with
regard to the possibility of Iran assuming its rightful
place in the world community and the chance for
better bilateral ties. We also welcome statements by
President Khatemi that suggest a possibility of
dialogue with the United States, and are taking
concrete steps in that direction. This month, we
implemented a new, more streamlined procedure for
issuing visas to Iranians who travel to the United
States frequently. We also revised our Consular
Travel Warning for Iran so that it better reflects
current attitudes in Iran towards American visitors.
We have supported cultural and academic
exchanges, and facilitated travel to the United States
by many Iranians.

However, these positive signs must be balanced
against the reality that lran’s support for terrorism has
not yet ceased, serious violations of human rights
persist, its efforts to develop long range missiles,
including the 1,300 kilometer-range Shahab-3 it flight
tested in July 1998, and its efforts to acquire WMD
continue. The United States will continue to oppose
any country selling or transferring to Iran materials
and technologies that could be used to develop long-
range missiles or weapons of mass destruction.
Similarly, we oppose Iranian efforts to sponsor terror.

We are ready to explore further ways to build mutual
confidence and avoid misunderstandings with Iran.
We will strengthen our cooperation with allies to
encourage positive changes in Iranian behavior. If a
dialogue can be initiated and sustained in a way that
addresses the concerns of both sides, then the
United States would be willing to develop with the
Islamic Republic a road map leading to normal
relations.

South Asia

South Asia has experienced an important expansion of
democracy and economic reform. Our strategy is
designed to help the peoples of that region enjoy the
fruits of democracy and greater stability by helping
resolve long-standing conflict and implementing
confidence-building measures. Regional stability and
improved bilateral ties are also important for U.S. eco-
nomic interests in a region that contains a fifth of the
world’s population and one of its most important
emerging markets. We seek to establish relationships
with India and Pakistan that are defined in terms of
their own individual merits and reflect the full weight

 

and range of U.S. strategic, political and economic
interests in each country. In addition, we seek to work
closely with regional countries to stem the flow of illegal
drugs from South Asia, most notably from Afghanistan.

The United States has long urged India and Pakistan to
take steps to reduce the risk of conflict and to bring
their nuclear and missile programs into conformity with
international standards. The Indian and Pakistani
nuclear test explosions were unjustified and threaten
to spark a dangerous nuclear arms race in Asia. As
a result of those tests and in accordance with our
laws the United States imposed sanctions against
India and Pakistan. The sanctions include
termination of assistance except for humanitarian
assistance for food or other agricultural commodities;
termination of sales of defense articles or services;
termination of foreign military financing; denial of non-
agricultural credit, credit guarantees or other financial
assistance by any agency of the U.S. Government;
prohibiting U.S. banks from making any loan or
providing any credit to the governments of India and
Pakistan except for the purpose of purchasing food or
other agricultural commodities; and prohibiting export
of specific goods and technology subject to export
licensing by the Commerce Department.

India and Pakistan are contributing to a self-defeating
cycle of escalation that does not add to the security
of either country. They have put themselves at odds
with the international community over these nuclear
tests. In concert with the other permanent members
of the UN Security Council and the G-8 nations, the
United States has called on both nations to renounce
further nuclear tests, to sign the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty immediately and without conditions, and
to resume their direct dialogue and take decisive
steps to reduce tensions in South Asia. We also
strongly urge these states to refrain from any actions,
such as testing, deployment or weaponization of
ballistic missiles, that would further undermine
regional and global stability. And we urge them to
join the clear international consensus in support of
nonproliferation and to join in negotiations in Geneva
for a cut off of fissile material production.

Promoting Prosperity

The United States has two principle economic
objectives in the region: to promote regional economic
cooperation and development, and to ensure
unrestricted flow of oil from the region. We seek to

53

promote regional trade and cooperation on infrastruc-
ture through the multilateral track of the peace process,
including revitalization of the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) economic summits.

The United States depends on oil for about 40 percent
of its primary energy needs and roughly half of our oil
needs are met with imports. Although we import less
than 10% of Persian Gulf exports, our allies in Europe
and Japan account for about 85% of these exports.
Previous oil shocks and the Gulf War underscore the
strategic importance of the region and show the impact
that an interruption of oil supplies can have on the
world’s economy. Appropriate responses to events
such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait can limit the magni-
tude of the crisis. Over the longer term, U.S. depen-
dence on access to these and other foreign oil
sources will remain important as our reserves are
depleted. The United States must remain vigilant to
ensure unrestricted access to this critical resource.
Thus, we will continue to demonstrate U.S. commit-
ment and resolve in the Persian Gulf.

Promoting Democracy

We encourage the spread of democratic values
throughout the Middle East and Southwest and South
Asia and will pursue this objective by a constructive
dialogue with countries in the region. In Iran, for
example, we hope the nation's leaders will carry out
the people's mandate for a government that respects
and protects the rule of law, both in its internal and
external affairs. We will promote responsible
indigenous moves toward increasing political
participation and enhancing the quality of governance
and will continue to vigorously challenge many
governments in the region to improve their human
rights records. Respect for human rights also
requires rejection of terrorism. If the nations in the
region are to safeguard their own citizens from the
threat of terror, they cannot tolerate acts of
indiscriminate violence against civilians, nor can they
offer refuge to those who commit such acts.

U.S. policies in the Middle East and Southwest Asia
are not anti-Islamic—an allegation made by some
opponents of our efforts to help bring lasting peace
and stability to the region. Islam is the fastest-
growing religious faith in the United States. We
respect deeply its moral teachings and its role as a
source of inspiration and instruction for hundreds of
millions of people around the world. U.S. policy in

54

 

the region is directed at the actions of governments
and terrorist groups, not peoples or faiths. The
standards we would like all the nations in the region
to observe are not merely Western, but universal.

Africa

In recent years, the United States has supported
significant change in Africa with considerable
success: multi-party democracies are more common
and elections are more frequent and open, human
rights are more widely respected, the press is more
free, U.S.-Africa trade is expanding, and a pragmatic
consensus on the need for economic reform is
emerging. A new, post-colonial generation of
leadership is reaching maturity in Africa, with more
democratic and pragmatic approaches to solving their
countries’ problems and developing their human and
natural resources.

To further those successes, President Clinton made
an unprecedented 12-day trip to Africa in March-April
1998. With President Museveni of Uganda, he co-
hosted the Entebbe Summit for Peace and Prosperity
to advance cooperation on conflict prevention, human
rights and economic integration. The summit was
attended by Prime Minister Meles of Ethiopia,
Presidents Moi of Kenya, Mkapa of Tanzania,
Bizimungu of Rwanda and Kabila of Congo. During
the trip, the President unveiled a number of new
programs to support democracy, prosperity and
opportunity, including initiatives on education, rule of
law, food security, trade and investment, aviation,
and conflict resolution. President Clinton directly
addressed the violent conflicts that have threatened
African democracy and prosperity.

Sustaining our success in Africa will require that we
identify those issues that most directly affect our
interests and where we can make a difference
through efficient targeting of our resources. A key
challenge is to engage the remaining autocratic
regimes to encourage those countries to follow the
example of other African countries that are success-
fully implementing political and economic reforms.

Enhancing Security

Serious transnational security threats emanate from
pockets of Africa, including state-sponsored

terrorism, narcotics trafficking, international crime,
environmental damage and disease. These threats
can only be addressed through effective, sustained
engagement in Africa. We have already made
significant progress in countering some of these
threats—investing in efforts to combat environmental
damage and disease, leading international efforts to
halt the proliferation of land mines and the demining
of Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Ethiopia
and Eritrea. We continue efforts to reduce the flow of
narcotics through Africa and to curtail international
criminal activity based in Africa. We seek to keep
Africa free of weapons of mass destruction by
supporting South Africa's nuclear disarmament and
accession to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state,
securing the indefinite and unconditional extension of
the NPT, and promoting establishment of the African
Nuclear Weapons Free Zone.

Libya and Sudan continue to pose a threat to regional
stability and the national security and foreign policy
interests of the United States. Our policy toward
Libya is designed to block its efforts to obtain
weapons of mass destruction and development of
conventional military capabilities that threaten its
neighbors, and to compel Libya to cease its support
for terrorism and its attempts to undermine other
governments in the region. The government of Libya
has continued these activities despite calls by the
Security Council that it demonstrate by concrete
actions its renunciation of terrorism. Libya also
continues to defy the United Nations by refusing to
turn over the two defendants in the terrorist bombing
of Pan Am 103. We remain determined that the
perpetrators of this act and the attack on UTA 772 be
brought to justice. We have moved to counter
Sudan’s support for international terrorism and
regional destabilization by imposing comprehensive
sanctions on the Khartoum regime, continuing to
press for the regime’s isolation through the UN
Security Council, and enhancing the ability of
Sudan’s neighbors to resist Knhartoum-backed
insurgencies in their countries through our Frontline
States initiative.

Persistent conflict and continuing political instability in
some African countries remain chronic obstacles to
Africa's development and to U.S. interests there,
including unhampered access to oil and other vital
natural resources. Our efforts to resolve conflict
include working to fully implement the Lusaka
Accords in Angola, sustaining the fragile new
government in Liberia, supporting the recently

 

restored democratic government in Sierra Leone and
the Economic Community of West African States
Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) efforts to ensure
security there, and achieving a peaceful, credible
transition to democratic government in Nigeria, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Congo-
Brazzaville.

To foster regional efforts to promote prosperity,
stability and peace in Africa, the United States in
1996 launched the African Crisis Response Initiative
(ACRI) to work with Africans to enhance their
capacity to conduct effective peacekeeping and
humanitarian operations. We are coordinating with
the French, British, other donor countries and African
governments in developing a sustainable plan of
action. The United States has already trained
battalions from Uganda, Senegal, Malawi, Mali and
Ghana, and is planning to train troops in Benin and
Cote D'Ivoire later this year. We are consulting
closely on ACRI activity with the UN Department of
Peacekeeping Operations, the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and its Crisis Management
Center, and African sub-regional organizations
already pursuing similar capacity enhancements. We
hope and expect that other African countries will also
participate in the effort in the future, building a well-
trained, interoperable, local capacity for
peacekeeping and humanitarian operations in a
region that has been fraught with turbulence and
crisis and all too dependent upon outside assistance
to deal with these problems.

On April 1, 1998, President Clinton announced that
the United States will be establishing the African
Center for Security Studies (ACSS). The ACSS will
be a regional center modeled after the George C.
Marshall Center in Germany, designed in
consultation with African nations and intended to
promote the exchange of ideas and information
tailored specifically for African concerns. The goal is
for ACSS to be a source of academic yet practical
instruction in promoting the skills necessary to make
effective national security decisions in democratic
governments, and engage African military and civilian
defense leaders in a substantive dialogue about
defense policy planning in democracies.

Promoting Prosperity

A stable, democratic, prosperous Africa will be a
better economic partner, a better partner for security

55

and peace, and a better partner in the fights against
drug trafficking, crime, terrorism, disease and
environmental degradation. An economically
dynamic Africa will be possible only when Africa is
fully integrated into the global economy. Our aim,
therefore, is to assist African nations to implement
economic reforms, create favorable climates for trade
and investment, and achieve sustainable
development. A majority of sub-Saharan Africa’s 48
countries have adopted market-oriented economic
and political reforms in the past seven years.

To support this positive trend, the President has
proposed the Partnership for Economic Growth and
Opportunity in Africa to support the economic
transformation underway in Africa. The
Administration is working closely with Congress to
implement key elements of this initiative through
rapid passage of the African Growth and Opportunity
Act. By significantly broadening market access,
spurring growth in Africa and helping the poorest
nations eliminate or reduce their bilateral debt, this
bill will better enable us to help African nations
undertake difficult economic reforms and build better
lives for their people through sustainable growth and
development.

Further integrating Africa into the global economy has
obvious political and economic benefits. It will also
directly serve U.S. interests by continuing to expand
an already important new market for U.S. exports.
The more than 700 million people of sub-Saharan
Africa represent one of the world’s largest largely
untapped markets. Although the United States
enjoys only a seven percent market share in Africa,
already 100,000 American jobs depend on our
exports there. Increasing both the U.S. market share
and the size of the African market will bring tangible
benefits to U.S. workers and increase prosperity and
economic opportunity in Africa. To encourage U.S.
trade with and investment in Africa, we are pursuing
several new initiatives and enhancements to the
Partnership for Economic Growth and Opportunity,
including greater market access, targeted technical
assistance, enhanced bilateral and World Bank debt
relief, and increased bilateral trade ties.

To further our trade objectives in Africa, the President
inaugurated the Ron Brown Commercial Center in
Johannesburg, South Africa on March 28, 1998. The
Center, which is operated and funded by the
Department of Commerce, provides support for
American companies looking to enter or expand into

56

 

the sub-Saharan African market. It promotes U.S.
exports through a range of support programs and
facilitates business contacts and partnerships
between African and American businesses. The
Center also serves as a base for other agencies such
as the Export-Import Bank, the Trade Development
Agency and USTR to expand their assistance to
business.

Because safe air travel and secure airports are
necessary for increasing trade, attracting investment,
and expanding tourism, the President on April 1,
1998 announced the ""Safe Skies for Africa” initiative.
The goals of this $1.2 million program—funded by the
Departments of State and Transportation—are to
work in partnership with Africa to increase the
number of sub-Saharan African countries that meet
ICAO standards for aviation safety, improve security
at 8-12 airports in the region within 3 years, and
improve regional air navigation services in Africa by
using modern satellite-based navigation aids and
communications technology. The initiative focuses
on safety assessments and security surveys in
selected countries and formulating action plans
together with Africa civil aviation authorities to bring
aviation safety and security practices in Africa up to
accepted world standards.

To support the desire of African nations to invest in a
better and healthier future for their children, the
President on March 24, 1998 announced three new
initiatives to improve educational standards, ensure
adequate food and agricultural production, and fight
the deadly infectious diseases that claim the lives of
too many African children.

* The Education for Development and
Democracy Initiative seeks to boost African
integration into the global community by
improving the quality of, and technology for,
education in Africa. The initiative is centered
on community resource centers, public-
private partnerships, and educating and
empowering girls. We plan on spending
approximately $120 million over two years in
support of this initiative.

¢ The Africa Food Security Initiative will assist
African nations in strengthening agriculture
and food security in a number of key areas,
including production of healthy and
alternative crops, better market efficiency
and distribution of existing crops, increased

trade and investment in agricultural
industries, attacking crop diseases, and
increasing access to agricultural technology
systems to assist with increased crop
production and distribution. Our pilot budget
for the first two years of the initiative will be
$61 million, which complements USAID's
current investments in these efforts.

* The third initiative is combating the infectious
diseases that claim many young lives. To
help combat malaria, we will provide an
additional $1 million grant to provide further
assistance to the Multilateral Initiative on
Malaria. The grant will focus on continuing
educational seminars and will support the
Regional Malaria Lab in Mali to reinforce its
position as a regional center of excellence in
Africa. This effort will complement our
ongoing Infectious Disease Initiative for
Africa that focuses on surveillance, response,
prevention and building local resistance to
infectious diseases.

Promoting Democracy

In Africa as elsewhere, democracies have proved
more peaceful, stable and reliable partners with
which we can work and are more likely to pursue
sound economic policies. We will continue to work to
sustain the important progress Africans have
achieved to date and to broaden the growing circle of
African democracies.

Restoration of democracy and respect for human
rights in Nigeria has long been one of our major
objectives in Africa. In June 1998, President Clinton
reaffirmed to Nigeria’s new leadership the friendship
of the United States for the people of Nigeria and
underscored our desire for improved bilateral
relations in the context of Nigeria taking swift and
significant steps toward a successful transition to a
democratically elected civilian government that
respects the human rights of its citizens. The release

 

of some political prisoners by the Nigerian
government is an encouraging sign, but much more
needs to be done and the United States will continue
to press for a credible transition to a democratic,
civilian government.

Through President Clinton’s $30 million Great Lakes
Justice Initiative, the United States will work with both
the people and governments of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi to support
judicial systems which are impartial, credible,
effective and inclusive. This initiative seeks to
strengthen judicial bodies, such as relevant Ministries
of Justice and Interior; improve the functioning of
court systems, prosecutors, police and prison
systems; work with national officials on specific
problem areas such as creation of civilian police
forces and legal assistance programs; support
training programs for police and judiciary officials;
develop improved court administration systems;
provide human rights training for military personnel
and support prosecution of abuses perpetrated by
military personnel; demobilize irregular elements of
standing armies and reintegrate them into society
and programs; and demobilize child soldiers.

In addition, we will work with our allies to find an
effective formula for promoting stability, democracy
and respect for human rights in the Democratic
Republic of Congo so that it and a democratic Nigeria
can become the regional centers for economic
growth, and democratic empowerment that they can
and should be. In order to help post-apartheid South
Africa achieve its economic, political, democratic and
security goals for all its citizens, we will continue to
provide substantial bilateral assistance, vigorously
promote U.S. trade and investment, and pursue close
cooperation and support for our mutual interests and
goals through the versatile Binational Commission
chaired by the Vice Presidents of each country.

Ultimately, the prosperity and security of Africa
depends on extensive political and economic reform,
and it is in the U.S. interest to support and promote
such reforms.

57

IV. Conclusions

Today, on the brink of the twenty-first century, we are
building new frameworks, partnerships and
institutions—and adapting existing ones—to strengthen
America’s security and prosperity. We are working to
construct new cooperative security arrangements, rid
the world of weapons that target whole populations,
build a truly global economy, and promote democratic
values and economic reform. Because diplomatic and
military responses alone may not deter threats to our
national security from non-state actors such as
criminals and terrorist groups, we must promote
increased cooperation among law enforcement
officials and improved methods for dealing with
international crime and terrorism. Ours is a moment
of historic opportunity to create a safer, more
prosperous tomorrow—to make a difference in the lives
of our citizens.

This promising state of affairs did not just happen, and
there is no guarantee that it will endure. The
contemporary era was forged by steadfast American
leadership over the last half century—through efforts
such as the Marshall Plan, NATO, the United Nations
and the World Bank. The clear dangers of the past
made the need for national security commitments and
expenditures obvious to the American people. Today,
the task of mobilizing public support for national
security priorities is more complicated. The complex
array of unique dangers, opportunities and
responsibilities outlined in this strategy are not always
readily apparent as we go about our daily lives focused
on immediate concerns. Yet, ina more integrated and
interdependent world, we must remain actively
engaged in world affairs to successfully advance our

 

national interests. To be secure and prosperous,
America must continue to lead.

Our international leadership focuses on President
Clinton's strategic priorities: to foster regional efforts
led by the community of democratic nations to
promote peace and prosperity in key regions of the
world, to create more jobs and opportunities for
Americans through a more open and competitive
trading system that also benefits others around the
world, to increase cooperation in confronting new
security threats that defy borders and unilateral
solutions, and to strengthen the intelligence, military,
diplomatic and law enforcement tools necessary to
meet these challenges. Our international leadership
is ultimately founded upon the power of our
democratic ideals and values. The spread of
democracy supports American values and enhances
our security and prosperity. The United States will
continue to support the trend toward democracy and
free markets by remaining actively engaged in the
world.

Our engagement abroad requires the active, sustained
support of the American people and the bipartisan
support of the U.S. Congress. This Administration
remains committed to explaining our security interests,
objectives and priorities to the nation and seeking the
broadest possible public and congressional support for
our security programs and investments. We will
continue to exercise our leadership in the world ina
manner that reflects our national values and protects
the security of this great nation.

THE WHITE HOUSE
DECEMBER 1999

Preface

Nearly 55 years ago, in his final inaugural
address, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt
reflected on the lessons of the first half of the
20!"" Century. ""We have learned,” he said, “that
we cannot live alone at peace. We have learned
that our own well being is dependent on the well
being of other nations far away. We have
learned to be citizens of the world, members of
the human community.""

Those words have more resonance than ever as
we enter the 21°"" century. America is at the
height of its influence and prosperity. But, ata
time of rapid globalization, when events halfway
around the earth can profoundly affect our safety
and prosperity, America must lead in the world
to protect our people at home and our way of
life. Americans benefit when nations come
together to deter aggression and terrorism, to
resolve conflicts, to prevent the spread of
dangerous weapons, to promote democracy and
human rights, to open markets and create
financial stability, to raise living standards, to
protect the environment — to face challenges
that no nation can meet alone. The United
States remains the world’s most powerful force
for peace, prosperity and the universal values of
democracy and freedom. Our nation’s central
challenge — and our responsibility — is to sustain
that role by seizing the opportunities of this new
global era for the benefit of our own people and
people around the world.

To do that, we are pursuing a forward-looking
national security strategy for the new century.
This report, submitted in accordance with
Section 603 of the Goldwater - Nichols Defense
Department Reorganization Act of 1986, sets
forth that strategy. Its three core objectives are:

* To enhance America’s security.
* To bolster America’s economic prosperity.

* To promote democracy and human rights
abroad.

 

The United States must have the tools necessary
to carry out this strategy. We have worked to
preserve and enhance the readiness of our
armed forces while pursuing long-term
modernization and providing quality of life
improvements for our men and women in
uniform. To better meet readiness challenges, |
proposed, and Congress passed, a fiscal year
2000 defense budget that increased military pay
and retirement benefits, and significantly
increased funding for readiness and
modernization. | have also proposed a $112
billion increase across fiscal years 2000 to 2005
for readiness, modernization, and other high
priority defense requirements. This is the first
long-term sustained increase in defense
spending in over a decade.

Over the last six months, our military leaders
and | have seen encouraging signs that we have
turned the corner on readiness. Although our
Armed Forces still face readiness challenges,
particularly in recruiting and retaining skilled
individuals, Administration initiatives are helping
us achieve our readiness goals. | am confident
that our military is — and will continue to be —
capable of carrying out our national strategy and
meeting America’s defense commitments
around the world.

To be secure, we must not only have a strong
military; we must also continue to lead in limiting
the military threat to our country and the world.
We continue to work vigilantly to curb the spread
of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and
missiles to deliver them. We are continuing the
START process to reduce Russian and
American nuclear arsenals, while discussing
modification of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to
allow for development of a national missile
defense against potential rogue state attacks.
And we remain committed to obtaining Senate
advice and consent to ratification of the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT), and to bringing this crucial agreement
into force.

We must also sustain our commitment to
America’s diplomacy. Every dollar we devote to
preventing conflicts, promoting democracy,
opening markets, and containing disease and
hunger brings a sure return in security and long-
term savings. Working with Congress, we were
able to provide enhanced funding to international
affairs accounts and UN arrears, but we need to
sustain this commitment to foreign affairs in the
years ahead.

America must be willing to act alone when our
interests demand it, but we should also support
the institutions and arrangements through which
other countries help us bear the burdens of
leadership. That's why | am pleased that we
reached agreement with Congress on a plan for
paying our dues and debts to the United Nations.
It is why we must do our part when others take
the lead in building peace: whether Europeans
in the Balkans, Asians in East Timor, or Africans
in Sierra Leone. Otherwise we will be left with a
choice in future crises between doing everything
ourselves or doing nothing at all.

America has done much over the past seven
years to build a better world: aiding the
remarkable transitions to free-market democracy
in Eastern Europe; adapting and enlarging
NATO to strengthen Europe’s security; ending
ethnic war in Bosnia and Kosovo; working with
Russia to deactivate thousands of nuclear
weapons from the former Soviet Union; ratifying
START II and the Chemical Weapons
Convention; negotiating the CTBT, and the
Adaptation Agreement on the Conventional
Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty; securing
a freeze in North Korean fissile material
production; facilitating milestone agreements in
the Middle East peace process; standing up to
the threat posed by Saddam Hussein; reducing
Africa’s debt through the Cologne Initiative and
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative
(HIPC); helping to broker peace accords from
Northern Ireland to Sierra Leone to the Peru-
Ecuador border; fostering unprecedented unity,
democracy and progress in the Western
Hemisphere; benefiting our economy by
reaching over 270 free trade agreements,
including the landmark accord to bring China

 

into the World Trade Organization; and
exercising global leadership to help save Mexico
from economic disaster and to reverse the Asian
financial crisis.

But our work is far from done. American
leadership will remain indispensable to further
important national interests in the coming year:
forging a lasting peace in the Middle East;
securing the peace in the Balkans and Northern
Ireland; helping Russia strengthen its economy
and fight corruption as it heads toward its first
democratic transfer of power; furthering arms
control through discussions with Russia on the
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and deeper
reductions in strategic nuclear weapons;
implementing China’s entry into the WTO and
other global institutions while promoting freedom
and human rights there; easing tensions
between India and Pakistan; building on hopeful
developments between Greece and Turkey to
make progress in the Aegean, particularly on
Cyprus; securing new energy routes from the
Caspian Sea that will allow newly independent
states in the Caucasus to prosper; supporting
democratic transitions from Nigeria to Indonesia;
helping Colombia defeat the drug traffickers who
threaten its democracy; fighting weapons
proliferation, terrorism and the nexus between
them; restraining North Korea's and Iran's
missile programs; maintaining vigilance against
Iraq and working to bring about a change in
regime; consolidating reforms to the world’s
financial architecture as the basis for sustained
economic growth; launching a new global trade
round; enacting legislation to promote trade with
Africa and the Caribbean; pressing ahead with
debt relief for countries fighting poverty and
embracing good government; reversing global
climate change; and protecting our oceans.

At this moment in history, the United States is
called upon to lead — to marshal the forces of
freedom and progress; to channel the energies
of the global economy into lasting prosperity; to
reinforce our democratic ideals and values; to
enhance American security and global peace.
We owe it to our children and grandchildren to
meet these challenges and build a better and
safer world.

|. Introduction

Our national security strategy is designed to meet the
fundamental purposes set out in the preamble to the
Constitution:

...provide for the common defence, promote the
general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of
Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,...

Since the founding of the nation, certain requirements
have remained constant. We must protect the lives
and personal safety of Americans, both at home and
abroad. We must maintain the sovereignty, political
freedom and independence of the United States, with
its values, institutions and territory intact. And, we
must promote the well-being and prosperity of the
nation and its people.

Opportunities and Challenges

The twenty-first Century will be an era of great
promise. Globalization — the process of accelerating
economic, technological, cultural and political
integration — is bringing citizens from all continents
closer together, allowing them to share ideas, goods
and information in an instant. A growing number of
nations around the world have embraced America’s
core values of democratic governance, free-market
economics and respect for fundamental human rights
and the rule of law, creating new opportunities to
promote peace, prosperity and cooperation among
nations. Many former adversaries now work with us
for common goals. The dynamism of the global
economy is transforming commerce, culture,
communications and global relations, creating new
jobs and opportunities for Americans.

Globalization, however, also brings risks. Outlaw
states and ethnic conflicts threaten regional stability
and progress in many important areas of the world.
Weapons of mass destruction (WMD), terrorism, drug
trafficking and other international crime are global
concerns that transcend national borders. Other
problems originating overseas — such as resource

 

depletion, rapid population growth, environmental
damage, new infectious diseases, pervasive
corruption, and uncontrolled refugee migration — have
increasingly important implications for American
security. Our workers and businesses will suffer if
the global economy is unstable or foreign markets
collapse or lock us out, and the highest domestic
environmental standards will not protect us
adequately if we cannot get others to achieve similar
standards. In short, our citizens have a direct and
increasing stake in the prosperity and stability of
other nations, in their support for international norms
and human rights, in their ability to combat
international crime, in their open markets, and in their
efforts to protect the environment.

National Interests

Since there are always many demands for U.S.
action, our national interests must be clear. These
interests fall into three categories. The first includes
vital interests—those of broad, overriding
importance to the survival, safety and vitality of our
nation. Among these are the physical security of our
territory and that of our allies, the safety of our
citizens, the economic well-being of our society, and
the protection of our critical infrastructures — including
energy, banking and finance, telecommunications,
transportation, water systems and emergency
services — from paralyzing attack. We will do what
we must to defend these interests, including, when
necessary and appropriate, using our military might
unilaterally and decisively.

The second category is important national
interests. These interests do not affect our national
survival, but they do affect our national well-being
and the character of the world in which we live.
Important national interests include, for example,
regions in which we have a sizable economic stake
or commitments to allies, protecting the global
environment from severe harm, and crises with a
potential to generate substantial and highly

destabilizing refugee flows. Our efforts to halt the
flow of refugees from Haiti and restore democracy in
that country, our participation in NATO operations to
end the brutal conflicts and restore peace in Bosnia
and Kosovo, and our assistance to Asian allies and
friends supporting the transition in East Timor are
examples.

The third category is humanitarian and other
interests. In some circumstances our nation may act
because our values demand it. Examples include
responding to natural and manmade disasters;
promoting human rights and seeking to halt gross
violations of those rights; supporting democratization,
adherence to the rule of law and civilian control of the
military; assisting humanitarian demining; and
promoting sustainable development and
environmental protection. The spread of democracy
and respect for the rule of law helps to create a world
community that is more hospitable to U.S. values and
interests. Whenever possible, we seek to avert
humanitarian disasters and conflict through
diplomacy and cooperation with a wide range of
partners, including other governments, international
institutions and non-governmental organizations.
This may not only save lives, but also prevent crises
from getting worse and becoming a greater drain on
resources.

Threats to U.S. Interests

The security environment in which we live is dynamic
and uncertain, replete with a host of threats and
challenges that have the potential to grow more
deadly.

Regional or State-Centered Threats: A number of
states have the capabilities and the desire to threaten
our national interests through coercion or aggression.
They continue to threaten the sovereignty of their
neighbors, economic stability, and international
access to resources. In many cases, these states
are also actively improving their offensive
capabilities, including efforts to obtain or retain
nuclear, biological or chemical weapons and the
capabilities to deliver these weapons over long
distances.

Transnational threats: These are threats that do not
respect national borders and which often arise from
non-state actors, such as terrorists and criminal
organizations. They threaten U.S. interests, values

 

and citizens — in the United States and abroad.
Examples include terrorism, drug trafficking and other
international crime, illicit arms trafficking, uncontrolled
refugee migration, and trafficking in human beings,
particularly women and children. We also face
threats to critical national infrastructures, which
increasingly could take the form of a cyber-attack in
addition to physical attack or sabotage, and could
originate from terrorist or criminal groups as well as
hostile states.

Spread of dangerous technologies: Weapons of
mass destruction pose the greatest potential threat to
global stability and security. Proliferation of
advanced weapons and technologies threatens to
provide rogue states, terrorists and international
crime organizations with the means to inflict terrible
damage on the United States, our allies and U.S.
citizens and troops abroad.

Failed states: At times in the new century, we can
expect that, despite international prevention efforts,
some states will be unable to provide basic
governance, safety and security, and opportunities
for their populations, potentially generating internal
conflict, mass migration, famine, epidemic diseases,
environmental disasters, mass killings and
aggression against neighboring states or ethnic
groups — events which can threaten regional security
and U.S. interests.

Other states — though possessing the capacity to
govern — may succumb to the inflammatory rhetoric
of demagogues who blame their nation’s ills on and
persecute specific religious, cultural, racial or tribal
groups. States that fail to respect the rights of their
own citizens and tolerate or actively engage in
human rights abuses, ethnic cleansing or acts of
genocide not only harm their own people, but can
spark civil wars and refugee crises and spill across
national boundaries to destabilize a region.

Foreign intelligence collection: The threat from
foreign intelligence services is more diverse, complex
and difficult to counter than ever before. This threat
is a mix of traditional and non-traditional intelligence
adversaries that have targeted American military,
diplomatic, technological, economic and commercial
secrets. Some foreign intelligence services are
rapidly adopting new technologies and innovative
methods to obtain such secrets, including attempts to
use the global information infrastructure to gain
access to sensitive information via penetration of

computer systems and networks. We must be
concerned about efforts by non-state actors,
including legitimate organizations, both quasi-
governmental and private, and illicit international
criminal organizations, to penetrate and subvert
government institutions or critical sectors of our
economy.

Environmental and health threats: Environmental
and health problems can undermine the welfare of
U.S. citizens, and compromise our national security,
economic and humanitarian interests abroad for
generations. These threats respect no national
boundary. History has shown that international
epidemics, such as polio, tuberculosis and AIDS, can
destroy human life on a scale as great as any war or
terrorist act we have seen, and the resulting burden
on health systems can undermine hard-won
advances in economic and social development and
contribute to the failure of fledgling democracies. In
the future, we face potentially even more devastating
threats if we fail to avert irreparable damage to
regional ecosystems and the global environment.
Other environmental issues, such as competition
over scarce fresh water resources, are a potential
threat to stability in several regions.

A Strategy of Engagement

Our strategy is founded on continued U.S.
engagement and leadership abroad. The United
States must lead abroad if we are to be secure at
home. We cannot lead abroad unless we devote the
necessary resources to military, diplomatic,
intelligence and other efforts. We must be prepared
and willing to use all appropriate instruments of
national power to influence the actions of other states
and non-state actors, to provide global leadership,
and to remain a reliable security partner for the
community of nations that share our interests. The
international community is at times reluctant to act
without American leadership. In some instances, the
United States is the only nation capable of providing
the necessary leadership and capabilities for an
international response to shared challenges. By
exerting our leadership abroad we have deterred
aggression, fostered the resolution of conflicts,
enhanced regional cooperation, strengthened
democracies, stopped human rights abuses, opened
foreign markets and tackled global problems such as
preventing the spread of weapons of mass

 

destruction, protected the environment, and
combated international corruption.

Our strategy has three core objectives: enhancing
American security; bolstering our economic
prosperity; and promoting democracy and human
rights abroad, which we strongly believe will, in turn,
advance the first two goals. Achieving these
objectives requires sustained, long-term effort. Many
of the threats to our national interests are persistent
or recurring — they cannot be resolved or eliminated
once and for all. American engagement must be
tempered by recognition that there are limits to
America’s involvement in the world, and that
decisions to commit resources must be weighed
against the need to sustain our engagement over the
long term. Our engagement therefore must be
selective, focusing on the threats and opportunities
most relevant to our interests and applying our
resources where we can make the greatest
difference. Additionally, sustaining our engagement
abroad over the long term will require the support of
the American people and the Congress to bear the
costs of defending U.S. interests — in dollars, effort
and, when necessary, with military force.

Implementing the Strategy

International cooperation will be vital for building
security in the next century because many of the
challenges we face cannot be addressed by a single
nation. Many of our security objectives are best
achieved — or can only be achieved — by leveraging
our influence and capabilities through international
organizations, our alliances, or as a leader of an ad
hoc coalition formed around a specific objective.
Leadership in the United Nations and other
international organizations, and durable relationships
with allies and friendly nations, are critical to our
security. A central thrust of our strategy is to
strengthen and adapt the formal relationships we
have with key nations around the world, create new
relationships and structures when necessary, and
enhance the capability of friendly nations to exercise
regional leadership in support of shared goals. At
other times, we seek to shape a favorable
international environment outside of formal structures
by building coalitions of like-minded nations. But we
must always be prepared to act alone when that is
our most advantageous course, or when we have no
alternative.

Success requires an integrated approach that brings
to bear all the capabilities needed to achieve our
security objectives — particularly in this era when
domestic and foreign policies increasingly overlap.
To effectively shape the international environment
and respond to the full spectrum of potential threats,
our diplomacy, military force, other foreign policy
tools, and domestic preparedness efforts must be
closely coordinated. We will continue to strengthen
and integrate all of these capabilities.

At home, we must have effective capabilities for
thwarting and responding to terrorist acts, countering
international crime and foreign intelligence collection,
and protecting critical national infrastructures. Our
efforts to counter these threats require close
cooperation among Federal agencies, state and local
governments, the industries that own and operate
critical national infrastructures, non-governmental
organizations, and others in the private sector.

 

The Power of Our Values

Underpinning our international leadership is the
power of our democratic ideals and values. In
crafting our strategy, we recognize that the spread of
democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of
law not only reflects American values, it also
advances both our security and prosperity.
Democratic governments are more likely to cooperate
with each other against common threats, encourage
free trade, promote sustainable economic
development, uphold the rule of law, and protect the
rights of their people. Hence, the trend toward
democracy and free markets throughout the world
advances American interests. The United States will
support this trend by remaining actively engaged in
the world, bolstering democratic institutions and
building the community of like-minded states. This
strategy will take us into the next century.

Il. Advancing U.S. National Interests

In our vision of the world, the United States has close
cooperative relations with the world’s most influential
countries, and has the ability to shape the policies
and actions of those who can affect our national well-
being. We seek to create a stable, peaceful
international security environment — one in which our
nation, citizens and interests are not threatened; the
health and well-being of our citizens are enhanced by
a cleaner global environment and effective strategies
to combat infectious disease; America continues to
prosper through increasingly open international
markets and sustainable growth in the global
economy; and democratic values and respect for
human rights and the rule of law are increasingly
accepted.

Enhancing Security at
Home and Abroad

Our strategy for enhancing U.S. security has three
components: shaping the international security
environment, responding to threats and crises, and
preparing for an uncertain future.

Shaping the International
Environment

The United States seeks to shape the international
environment through a variety of means, including
diplomacy, economic cooperation, international
assistance, arms control and nonproliferation, and
health initiatives. These activities enhance U.S.
security by promoting regional security; enhancing
economic progress; supporting military activities,
international law enforcement cooperation, and
environmental efforts; and preventing, reducing or
deterring the diverse threats we face today. These
measures adapt and strengthen alliances and
friendships, maintain U.S. influence in key regions,
and encourage adherence to international norms.

 

The U.S. intelligence community provides critical
support to the full range of our involvement abroad.
Comprehensive collection and analytic capabilities
are needed to provide warning of threats to U.S.
national security, give analytical support to the policy
and military communities, provide near-real time
intelligence while retaining global perspective, identify
opportunities for advancing our national interests,
and maintain our information advantage in the
international arena. We place the highest priority on
monitoring the most serious threats to U.S. security:
states hostile to the United States; countries or other
entities that possess strategic nuclear forces or
control nuclear weapons, other WMD or nuclear
fissile materials; transnational threats, including
terrorism, drug trafficking and other international
crime; potential regional conflicts that might affect
U.S. national security interests; and threats to U.S.
forces and citizens abroad.

Diplomacy

Diplomacy is a vital tool for countering threats to our
national security. The daily business of diplomacy
conducted through our missions and representatives
around the world is an irreplaceable shaping activity.
These efforts are essential to sustaining our
alliances, forcefully articulating U.S. interests,
resolving regional disputes peacefully, averting
humanitarian catastrophe, deterring aggression
against the United States and our friends and allies,
promoting international economic cooperation and
stability, fostering trade and investment opportunities,
and projecting U.S. influence worldwide.

When signs of potential conflict emerge or potential
threats appear, we take action to prevent or reduce
these threats. One of the lessons that repeatedly has
been driven home is the importance of preventive
diplomacy in dealing with conflict and complex
emergencies. Helping prevent nations from failing is
far more effective than rebuilding them after an
internal crisis. Helping people stay in their homes is

far more beneficial than feeding and housing them in
refugee camps. Helping relief agencies and
international organizations strengthen the institutions
of conflict resolution is much better than healing
ethnic and social divisions that have already
exploded into bloodshed. In short, while crisis
management and crisis resolution are necessary
tasks for our foreign policy, preventive diplomacy is
far preferable.

We must renew our commitment to America’s
diplomacy to ensure we have the diplomatic
representation and voice in international
organizations that are required to support our global
interests. This is central to our ability to retain our
influence on international issues that affect our well-
being. Our national security requires that we ensure
international organizations such as the United
Nations are as effective and relevant as possible.
We must, therefore, continue to work to ensure that
our financial obligations to international organizations
are met.

Preserving our leadership, influence and credibility in
the world demands that we maintain highly trained
and experienced personnel, a broad range of
capabilities for diplomacy and public diplomacy, and
a secure diplomatic infrastructure abroad.
Modernization of embassies, consulates and our
diplomatic telecommunications and information
infrastructure is essential to advancing and protecting
vital national interests overseas. Our embassies and
consulates host critical elements of peacetime power:
diplomatic personnel, commercial, defense and legal
attaches, and consular and security officers
dedicated to protecting Americans at home and
abroad. The cost of doing these things is a tiny
fraction of the costs of employing our military forces
to cope with crises that might have been averted
through collective international action.

Public Diplomacy

We have an obligation and opportunity to harness the
tools of public diplomacy to advance U.S. leadership
around the world by engaging international publics on
U.S. principles and policies. The global advance of
freedom and information technologies like the
Internet has increased the ability of citizens and
organizations to influence the policies of
governments to an unprecedented degree. This
makes our public diplomacy — efforts to transmit

 

information and messages to peoples around the
world — an increasingly vital component of our
national security strategy. Our programs enhance
our ability to inform and influence foreign publics in
support of U.S. national interests, and broaden the
dialogue between American citizens and U.S.
institutions and their counterparts abroad.

Effective use of our nation’s information capabilities
to counter misinformation and incitement, mitigate
inter-ethnic conflict, promote independent media
organizations and the free flow of information, and
support democratic participation helps advance U.S.
interests abroad. International Public Information
activities, as defined by the newly promulgated
Presidential Decision Directive 68 (PDD-68), are
designed to improve our capability to coordinate
independent public diplomacy, public affairs and
other national security information-related efforts to
ensure they are more successfully integrated into
foreign and national security policy making and
execution.

International Assistance

From the U.S.-led mobilization to rebuild post-war
Europe to more recent economic success stories
across Asia, Latin America and Africa, U.S. foreign
assistance has helped emerging democracies,
promoted respect for human rights and the rule of
law, expanded free markets, slowed the growth of
international crime, contained major health threats,
improved protection of the environment and natural
resources, slowed population growth, and defused
humanitarian crises. Crises are averted — and U.S.
preventive diplomacy actively reinforced — through
U.S. sustainable development programs that promote
the rights of workers, voluntary family planning, basic
education, environmental protection, democratic
governance, the rule of law, religious freedom, and
the economic empowerment of citizens.

Debt relief is an important element of our overall
effort to alleviate poverty, promote economic
development, and create stronger partners around
the world for trade and investment, security and
democracy. The Cologne Debt Initiative announced
at the 1999 G-8 summit, together with earlier debt
relief commitments, provides for reduction of up to 70
percent of the total debts for heavily indebted poor
countries. This will be a reduction from the current
level of about $127 billion to as low as $37 billion with

the cancellation of official development assistance
debt by G-8 and other bilateral creditors.

The Cologne Debt Initiative also calls on international
financial institutions to develop a new framework for
linking debt relief with poverty reduction. These
measures center around better targeting of budgetary
resources for priority social expenditures, for health,
child survival, AIDS prevention, education, greater
transparency in government budgeting, and much
wider consultation with civil society in the
development and implementation of economic
programs. In September, President Clinton took our
debt relief efforts a step further. He directed the
Administration to make it possible to forgive 100
percent of the debt these countries owe to the United
States when the money is needed and will be used to
help them finance basic human needs.

When combined with other efforts, such as our
cooperative scientific and technological programs,
U.S. aid initiatives can help reduce the need for
costly military and humanitarian measures. When
assistance programs succeed in promoting
democracy and free markets, substantial growth of
American exports has usually followed. Where crises
have occurred, our assistance programs have helped
alleviate mass human suffering through targeted
relief. Other assistance programs have created a
path out of conflict and dislocation, helped to restore
elementary security and civic institutions, and
promoted political stability and economic recovery.

Arms Control and Nonproliferation

Arms control and nonproliferation initiatives are an
essential element of our national security strategy
and a critical complement to our efforts to defend our
nation through our own military strength. We pursue
verifiable arms control and nonproliferation
agreements that support our efforts to prevent the
spread and use of WMD, prevent the spread of
materials and expertise for producing WMD and the
means of delivering them, halt the use of
conventional weapons that cause unnecessary
suffering, and contribute to regional stability at lower
levels of armaments. In addition, by increasing
transparency in the size, structure and operations of
military forces and building confidence in the
intentions of other countries, arms control
agreements and confidence-building measures

 

constrain inventories of dangerous weapons, reduce
incentives and opportunities to initiate an attack,
reduce the mutual suspicions that arise from and
spur on armaments competition, and help provide the
assurance of security necessary to strengthen
cooperative relationships and direct resources to
safer, more productive endeavors.

Verifiable reductions in strategic offensive arms and
the steady shift toward less destabilizing systems
remain essential to our strategy. Entry into force of
the START | Treaty in December 1994 charted the
course for reductions in the deployed strategic
nuclear forces of the United States and Russia. The
other countries of the former Soviet Union that had
nuclear weapons on their soil — Belarus, Kazakhstan
and Ukraine — have become non-nuclear weapons
states. Once the START II Treaty enters into force,
the United States and Russia will each be limited to
between 3,000-3,500 accountable strategic nuclear
warheads. START II also will eliminate destabilizing
land-based multiple warhead and heavy missiles. On
September 26, 1997, the United States and Russia
signed a START II Protocol extending the end date
for reductions to 2007, and exchanged letters on
early deactivation by 2003 of those strategic nuclear
delivery systems to be eliminated by 2007.

At the Helsinki Summit in March 1997, Presidents
Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to START III guidelines
that, if adopted, will cap the number of strategic
nuclear warheads deployed in each country at 2,000-
2,500 by the end of 2007 — reducing both our
arsenals by 80 percent from Cold War heights. They
also agreed that, in order to promote the irreversibility
of deep reductions, a START III agreement will
include measures relating to the transparency of
strategic nuclear warhead inventories and the
destruction of strategic nuclear warheads. The
statement also committed the two nations to explore
possible measures relating to non-strategic nuclear
weapons, to include appropriate confidence building
and transparency measures.

The Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty remains a
cornerstone of strategic stability, and the United
States is committed to continued efforts to enhance
the Treaty’s viability and effectiveness. At the
Helsinki Summit, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin
reaffirmed their commitment to the ABM Treaty and
recognized the need for effective theater missile
defenses in an agreement in principle on

demarcation between systems to counter strategic
ballistic missiles and those to counter theater ballistic
missiles.

On September 26, 1997, representatives of the
United States, Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and
Ukraine signed or initialed five agreements relating to
the ABM Treaty. At the Cologne G-8 Summit in June
1999, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin reiterated their
determination to achieve earliest possible ratification
and entry into force of those agreements. The
agreements on demarcation and succession will be
provided to the Senate for its advice and consent
following Russian ratification of START II.

The two presidents also reaffirmed at Cologne their
existing obligations under Article XIII of the ABM
Treaty to consider possible changes in the strategic
situation that have a bearing on the ABM Treaty and,
as appropriate, possible proposals for further
increasing the viability of the Treaty. They also
agreed to begin discussions on the ABM Treaty,
which are now underway in parallel with discussions
on START Ill. The United States is proposing that
the ABM Treaty be modified to accommodate
possible deployment of a limited National Missile
Defense (NMD) system which would counter new
rogue state threats while preserving strategic
stability.

At the Moscow Summit in September 1998,
Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin agreed on a new
initiative for the exchange of early warning
information on missile launches. The agreement will
significantly reduce the danger that ballistic missiles
could be launched inadvertently on false warning of
attack. It will also promote increased mutual
confidence in the capabilities of the ballistic missile
early warning systems of both sides. The United
States and Russia will develop arrangements for
providing each other with continuous information from
their respective early warning systems on launches of
ballistic missiles and space launch vehicles. As part
of this initiative, the United States and Russia are
establishing a Joint Warning Center in Russia to
continuously monitor early warning data. The United
States and Russia are also working towards
establishing a ballistic missile and space launch
vehicle pre-launch notification regime in which other
states would be invited to participate.

To be secure, we must not only have a strong
military; we must also take the lead in building a

 

safer, more responsible world. We have a
fundamental responsibility to limit the spread of
nuclear weapons and reduce the danger of nuclear
war. To this end, the United States remains
committed to bringing the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) into force.

More than 150 countries have signed the Treaty so
far, agreeing to refrain from all nuclear explosive
testing. The CTBT will constrain nuclear weapons
development and will also help prevent nuclear
weapons technologies from spreading to other
countries. The United States ended nuclear testing
seven years ago; the CTBT requires other countries
to refrain from testing, too. We have developed
means of making sure our nuclear weapons work
through non-nuclear tests and computer simulations,
rather than by tests with nuclear explosions, and we
spend $4.5 billion a year to ensure that our nuclear
weapons remain safe and reliable.

The CTBT will put in place a worldwide network for
detecting nuclear explosions. With over 300 stations
around the globe — including 31 in Russia, 11 in
China, and 17 in the Middle East — this international
monitoring system will improve our ability to monitor
suspicious activity and catch cheaters. The United
States already has dozens of monitoring stations of
its own; the CTBT will allow us to take advantage of
other countries’ stations and create new ones, too.
The Treaty also will give us the right to request on-
site inspections of suspected nuclear testing sites in
other countries.

The United States will maintain its moratorium on
nuclear testing, and is encouraging all other states to
do the same. We are encouraging all states that
have not done so to sign and ratify the CTBT. We
remain committed to obtaining Senate advice and
consent toward ratification of the CTBT. U.S.
ratification will encourage other states to ratify,
enable the United States to lead the international
effort to gain CTBT entry into force, and strengthen
international norms against nuclear testing.

The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is the
cornerstone of international nuclear nonproliferation
efforts and reinforces regional and global security by
creating confidence in the non-nuclear commitments
of its parties. It was an indispensable precondition
for the denuclearization of Ukraine, Kazakhstan,
Belarus and South Africa. We seek to ensure that
the NPT remains a strong and vital element of global

security by achieving universal adherence and full
compliance by its parties with their Treaty obligations.
Achieving a successful Review Conference in 2000
will be important to the future of this critical Treaty.
We will vigorously promote the value of the NPT in
preventing the spread of nuclear weapons while
continuing policies designed to reduce U.S. reliance
on nuclear weapons and to work for their ultimate
elimination.

To reinforce the international nuclear nonproliferation
regime, we seek to strengthen the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards system
and achieve a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty in the
Geneva Conference on Disarmament. Halting
production of fissile materials for nuclear explosions
would cap the supply of nuclear materials available
worldwide for weapons, a key step in halting the
spread of nuclear weapons. A coordinated effort by
the intelligence community and law enforcement
agencies to detect, prevent and deter illegal
trafficking in fissile materials, and the Material
Protection, Control and Accounting program, which
enhances security for nuclear materials having
potential terrorist applications, are also essential to
our counter-proliferation efforts.

Through the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat
Reduction (CTR) Program and other initiatives, we
aim to strengthen controls over weapons-usable
fissile material and prevent the theft or diversion of
WMD and related material and technology from the
former Soviet Union. The CTR Program has
effectively supported enhanced safety, security,
accounting and centralized control measures for
nuclear weapons and fissile materials in the former
Soviet Union. It has assisted Ukraine, Kazakhstan
and Belarus in becoming non-nuclear weapons
states and will continue to assist Russia in meeting
its START obligations. The CTR Program is also
supporting measures to eliminate and prevent the
proliferation of chemical weapons and biological
weapon-related capabilities, and has supported many
ongoing military reductions and reform measures in
the former Soviet Union. We are working to
strengthen the Convention on the Physical Protection
of Nuclear Material to increase accountability and
protection, which complements our effort to enhance
IAEA safeguards.

In 1999, the President launched the Expanded Threat
Reduction Initiative (ETRI). This effort is designed to
address the new security challenges in Russia and

 

the other Newly Independent States (NIS) caused by
the financial crisis, including preventing WMD
proliferation, reducing the threat posed by residual
WMD, and stabilizing the military. This initiative
builds on the success of existing programs, such as
the CTR program, the Material Protection, Control
and Accounting program and the Science Centers, to
make additional progress in the more challenging
environment now facing Russia and the NIS. ETRI
initiatives will substantially expand our cooperative
efforts to eliminate WMD in the NIS and prevent their
proliferation abroad. A new component of our
nuclear security program will greatly increase the
security of fissile material by concentrating it at fewer,
well-protected sites, and new programs will increase
the security of facilities and experts formerly
associated with the Soviet Union's biological
weapons effort.

At the Cologne summit in June 1999, the leaders of
the G-8 nations affirmed their intention to establish
arrangements to protect and safely manage
weapons-grade fissile material no longer required for
defense purposes, especially plutonium. They
expressed strong support for initiatives being
undertaken by G-8 countries and others for scientific
and technical cooperation necessary to support
future large-scale disposition programs, invited all
interested countries to support projects for early
implementation of such programs, and urged
establishment of a joint strategy for cooperation in
large-scale disposition projects. They also
recognized that an international approach to
financing will be required — involving both public and
private funds — and agreed to review potential
increases in their resource commitments prior to the
next G-8 Summit in July 2000.

We are purchasing tons of highly enriched uranium
from dismantled Russian nuclear weapons for
conversion into commercial reactor fuel, and working
with Russia to remove 34 metric tons of plutonium
from each country’s nuclear weapons programs and
converting it so that it can never be used in nuclear
weapons. We are redirecting dozens of former
Soviet WMD facilities and tens of thousands of
former Soviet WMD scientists in Eastern Europe and
Eurasia from military activities to beneficial civilian
research. These efforts include implementing a new
biotechnical initiative aimed at increasing
transparency in former Soviet biological weapons
facilities and redirecting their scientists to civilian
commercial, agricultural, and public health activities.

In support of U.S. efforts to prevent proliferation of
WMD by organized crime groups and individuals in
the NIS and Eastern Europe, the Departments of
Defense, Energy, Commerce, the U.S. Customs
Service, and the FBI are engaging in programs that
assist governments in developing effective export
control systems and capabilities to prevent, deter, or
detect proliferation of WMD and weapons materials
across borders. These programs provide training,
equipment, advice, and services to law enforcement
and border security agencies in these countries.

We seek to strengthen the Biological Weapons
Convention (BWC) with a new international regime to
ensure compliance. We are negotiating with other
BWC member states in an effort to reach consensus
on a protocol to the BWC that would implement an
inspection system to enhance compliance and
promote transparency. We are also working hard to
implement and enforce the Chemical Weapons
Convention (CWC). The United States Congress
underscored the importance of these efforts in
October 1998 by passing implementing legislation
that makes it possible for the United States to comply
with the requirements in the CWC for commercial
declarations and inspections.

The Administration also seeks to prevent
destabilizing buildups of conventional arms and limit
access to sensitive technical information, equipment
and technologies by strengthening international
regimes, including the Wassenaar Arrangement on
Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use
Goods and Technologies, the Australia Group (for
chemical and biological weapons), the Missile
Technology Control Regime, the Nuclear Suppliers
Group, and the Zangger Committee (which ensures
that IAEA safeguards are applied to nuclear exports).
At the NATO 50"" Anniversary Summit, Allied leaders
agreed to enhance NATO's ability to deal both
politically and militarily with the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and the means of their
delivery.

Regional nonproliferation efforts are particularly
important in three critical proliferation zones. On the
Korean Peninsula, we are implementing the 1994
Agreed Framework, which requires full compliance by
North Korea with its nonproliferation obligations. We
also seek to convince North Korea to halt its
indigenous missile program and exports of missile
systems and technologies. In the Middle East and
Southwest Asia, we encourage regional confidence

10

 

building measures and arms control agreements that
address the legitimate security concerns of all
parties, and continue efforts to thwart and roll back
lran’s development of WMD and long-range missiles,
and Iraq’s efforts to reconstitute its WMD programs.
In South Asia, we seek to persuade India and
Pakistan to refrain from weaponization or deployment
of nuclear weapons, testing or deploying missiles
capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and further
production of fissile material for nuclear weapons, as
well as to adhere fully to international nonproliferation
standards and to sign and ratify the CTBT.

Over the past three years, the United States has
worked to ensure that the landmark 1990
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty
remains a cornerstone of European peace, security
and stability into the twenty-first century. On
November 19, 1999, we joined the other 29 CFE
States Parties in signing an Adaptation Agreement
that eliminates obsolete bloc-to-bloc limits and
replaces them with nationally based ceilings. It will
also enhance transparency through more information
and inspections, strengthen requirements for host
nation consent to the presence of foreign forces, and
open the treaty to accession by other European
nations. The accompanying CFE Final Act reflects a
number of important political commitments, including
agreements on the complete withdrawal of Russian
armed forces from Moldova and partial withdrawal of
Russian forces from Georgia. President Clinton has
stated that he will only submit the CFE Adaptation
Agreement to the Senate for advice and consent to
ratification when Russian forces have been reduced
to the flank levels set forth in the adapted Treaty.

President Clinton is committed to ending the threat to
innocent civilians from anti-personnel landmines
(APLs). The United States has already taken major
steps toward this goal while ensuring our ability to
meet international obligations and provide for the
safety and security of our men and women in
uniform. President Clinton has directed the Defense
Department to end the use of all APLs, including self-
destructing APLs, outside Korea by 2003 and to
pursue aggressively the objective of having APL
alternatives ready for Korea by 2006. We will also
aggressively pursue alternatives to our mixed anti-
tank systems that contain anti-personnel
submunitions. We have made clear that the United
States will sign the Ottawa Convention by 2006 if by
then we have succeeded in identifying and fielding

suitable alternatives to our self-destructing APLs and
mixed anti-tank systems.

In May 1999, we gained Senate advice and consent
to ratification of the Amended Mines Protocol to the
Convention on Conventional Weapons. This
agreement addresses the worldwide humanitarian
problem caused by APLs by banning the use of non-
detectable APLs and severely limiting the use of
long-duration APLs to clearly marked and monitored
fields that effectively keep out civilians. We have
established a permanent ban on APL exports and are
seeking to universalize an export ban through the
Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. We are
supporting humanitarian demining programs
worldwide through engagement with mine-afflicted
nations and the international community, and through
our ""Demining 2010"" initiative have challenged the
world to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of
removing landmines that threaten civilians.

Military Activities

The U.S. military plays a crucial role in shaping the
international security environment in ways that
protect and promote U.S. interests, but is not a
substitute for other forms of engagement, such as
diplomatic, economic, scientific, technological,
cultural and educational activities. Through
overseas presence and peacetime engagement
activities such as defense cooperation, security
assistance, and training and exercises with allies and
friends, our Armed Forces help to deter aggression
and coercion, build coalitions, promote regional
stability and serve as role models for militaries in
emerging democracies. With countries that are
neither staunch friends nor known foes, military
cooperation can serve as a positive means of
building security relationships today that will
contribute to improved relations tomorrow. At the
same time, we remain firmly committed to human
rights and we will continue to ensure that we do not
train or assist known human rights abusers.

Maintaining our overseas presence promotes
regional stability, giving substance to our security
commitments, helping to prevent the development of
power vacuums and instability, and contributing to
deterrence by demonstrating our determination to
defend U.S., allied, and friendly interests in critical
regions. Having credible combat forces forward
deployed in peacetime also better positions the

 

United States to respond rapidly to crises. Equally
essential is effective global power projection, which is
key to the flexibility demanded of our forces and
provides options for responding to potential crises
and conflicts even when we have no permanent
presence or a limited infrastructure in a region.

Strategic mobility is a key element of our strategy. It
is critical for allowing the United States to be first on
the scene with assistance in many domestic or
international crises, and is a key to successful
American leadership and engagement. Deployment
and sustainment of U.S. and multinational forces
requires maintaining and ensuring access to
sufficient fleets of aircraft, ships, vehicles and trains,
as well as bases, ports, pre-positioned equipment
and other infrastructure.

Although military activities are an important pillar of
our effort to shape the global security environment,
we must always be mindful that the primary mission
of our Armed Forces is to deter and, if necessary, to
fight and win conflicts in which our vital interests are
threatened.

Just as American engagement overall must be
selective—focusing on the threats and opportunities
most relevant to our interests and applying our
resources where we can make the greatest
difference—so must our use of the Armed Forces for
engagement be selective. Engagement activities
must be carefully managed to prevent erosion of our
military's current and long-term readiness. The
Defense Department's theater engagement planning
process, which was approved by the President in
1997, helps ensure that military engagement
activities are prioritized within and across theaters,
and balanced against available resources. In short,
we must prioritize military engagement activities to
ensure the readiness of our Armed Forces to carry
out crisis response and warfighting missions, as well
as to ensure that we can sustain an appropriate level
of engagement activities over the long term.

Our ability to deter potential adversaries in peacetime
rests on several factors, particularly on our
demonstrated will and ability to uphold our security
commitments when they are challenged. We have
earned this reputation through both our declaratory
policy, which clearly communicates costs to potential
adversaries, and our credible warfighting capability.
This capability is embodied in ready forces and
equipment strategically stationed or deployed

11

forward, in forces in the United States at the
appropriate level of readiness to deploy when
needed, in our ability to gain timely access to critical
regions and infrastructure overseas, and in our
demonstrated ability to form and lead effective
military coalitions. Because terrorist organizations
may not be deterred by traditional means, we must
ensure a robust capability to accurately attribute the
source of attacks against the United States or its
citizens, and to respond effectively and decisively to
protect our national interests.

Our nuclear deterrent posture is one example of how
U.S. military capabilities are used effectively to deter
aggression and coercion against U.S. interests.
Nuclear weapons serve as a guarantee of our
security commitments to allies and a disincentive to
those who would contemplate developing or
otherwise acquiring their own nuclear weapons. Our
military planning for the possible employment of U.S.
strategic nuclear weapons is focused on deterring a
nuclear war and emphasizes the survivability of our
nuclear systems and infrastructure necessary to
endure a preemptive attack and still respond at
overwhelming levels. The United States will continue
to maintain a robust triad of strategic nuclear forces
sufficient to deter any potential adversaries who may
have or seek access to nuclear forces — to convince
them that seeking a nuclear advantage or resorting to
nuclear weapons would be futile. In addition, some
U.S. non-strategic nuclear forces are maintained in a
forward-deployed status in NATO as a visible
reminder of our security commitment.

We must also ensure the continued viability of the
infrastructure that supports U.S. nuclear forces and
weapons. The Stockpile Stewardship Program will
provide high confidence in the safety and reliability of
our nuclear weapons under the Comprehensive
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

The United States is committed to preserving
internationally recognized freedom of navigation on
and overflight of the world's oceans, which are critical
to the future strength of our nation and to maintaining
global stability. Freedom of navigation and overflight
are essential to our economic security and for the
worldwide movement and sustainment of U.S.
military forces. These freedoms are codified in the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,
which the President submitted to the Senate in 1994

12

 

for advice and consent to ratification. In addition to
lending the certainty of the rule of law to an area
critical to our national security, the Convention
preserves our leadership in global ocean policy.
Thus, the Law of the Sea Convention buttresses the
strategic advantages that the United States gains
from being a global power, and ratification of the
Convention remains a high priority.

We are committed to maintaining U.S. leadership in
space. Unimpeded access to and use of space is a
vital national interest — essential for protecting U.S.
national security, promoting our prosperity and
ensuring our well-being. Consistent with our
international obligations, we will deter threats to our
interests in space, counter hostile efforts against U.S.
access to and use of space, and maintain the ability
to counter space systems and services that could be
used for hostile purposes against our military forces,
command and control systems, or other critical
capabilities. We will maintain our technological
superiority in space systems, and sustain a robust
U.S. space industry and a strong, forward-looking
research base. We also will continue efforts to
prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction
to space, and will continue to pursue global
partnerships addressing space-related scientific,
economic, environmental and security issues.

We also are committed to maintaining information
superiority — the capability to collect, process, and
disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information
while exploiting and/or denying an adversary’s ability
to do the same. Operational readiness, as well as
the command and control of forces, relies
increasingly on information systems and technology.
We must keep pace with rapidly evolving information
technology so that we can cultivate and harvest the
promise of information superiority among U.S. forces
and coalition partners while exploiting the shortfalls in
our adversaries’ information capabilities.

Quality people — civilian and military — are our most
critical asset in implementing our defense activities.
The quality of our men and women in uniform will be
the deciding factor in future military operations. We
must ensure that we remain the most fully prepared
and best trained military force in the world.
Accordingly, we will continue to place the highest
priority on programs that support recruiting, retention,
quality of life, training and education.

International Law Enforcement
Cooperation

As threats to our national security from terrorism,
drug trafficking and other international crime
increase, U.S. and foreign law enforcement and
judicial agencies must continue to find innovative
ways to implement a concerted, global plan to
combat international crime. As highlighted in the
President’s International Crime Control Strategy, one
way to accomplish this is through cooperative
activities, such as overseas law enforcement
presence, that leverage our resources and foster the
establishment of effective working relationships with
foreign law enforcement agencies. U.S. investigators
and prosecutors work to enlist the cooperation of
foreign law enforcement officials, keeping crime away
from American shores, enabling the arrest of many
U.S. fugitives and solving serious U.S. crimes. This
presence creates networks of law enforcement
professionals dedicated to preventing crime and
bringing international criminals to justice.

The Department of State and U.S. federal law
enforcement agencies are engaged in a cooperative
effort to provide assistance to law enforcement
agencies in Central and Eastern Europe and East
Asia through the International Law Enforcement
Academies that have been established in Hungary
and Thailand. The ILEA initiative is a multinational
effort organized by the United States, the host
nations, and other international training partners to
provide mutual assistance and law enforcement
training.

Environmental and Health
Initiatives

Decisions today regarding the environment and
natural resources can affect our security for
generations. Environmental threats do not heed
national borders; environmental peril overseas can
pose long-term dangers to Americans’ security and
well-being. Natural resource scarcities can trigger
and exacerbate conflict. Environmental threats such
as climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion,
introduction of nuisance plant and animal species,
overharvesting of fish, forests and other living natural
resources, and the transnational movement of

 

hazardous chemicals and waste directly threaten the
health and economic well-being of U.S. citizens.

We have a full diplomatic agenda to respond
aggressively to environmental threats. For example,
at Kyoto in December 1997, the industrialized nations
of the world agreed for the first time to binding limits
on greenhouse gases. This was a vital turning point,
but we must press for participation by key developing
nations and will not submit the Kyoto protocol for
ratification until they have agreed to participate
meaningfully in efforts to address global warming.

Diseases and health risks can no longer be viewed
solely as a domestic concern. Like the global
economy, the health and well-being of all peoples are
becoming increasingly interdependent. With the
movement of millions of people per day across
international borders and the expansion of
international trade, health issues as diverse as
importation of dangerous infectious diseases and
bioterrorism preparedness profoundly affect our
national security. Besides reducing the direct threat
to Americans from disease, healthy populations
internationally provide an essential underpinning for
economic development, democratization and political
stability. We are, therefore, taking a leadership role
to promote international cooperation on health
issues.

Beyond these general concerns, a number of specific
international health issues are critical for our national
security. Because a growing proportion of our
national food supply is coming from international
sources, assuring the safety of the food we consume
must be a priority. The Administration has
announced new and stronger programs to ensure the
safety of imported as well as domestic foods, to be
overseen by the President’s Council on Food Safety.
New and emerging infections such as drug-resistant
tuberculosis and the Ebola virus can move with the
speed of jet travel. We are actively engaged with the
international health community as well as the World
Health Organization to stop the spread of these
dangerous diseases.

The worldwide epidemic HIV/AIDS is destroying
peoples and economies on an unprecedented scale
and is now the number one cause of death in Africa,
killing over 5,500 per day. The Administration has
taken bold new steps to combat this devastating
epidemic, including reaching agreement in 1999 with

13

the G-8 in Cologne to link debt relief with social
programs such as HIV/AIDS prevention. And at the
United Nations in September 1999, the President
committed the United States to a concerted effort to
accelerate the development and delivery of vaccines
for AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases
disproportionately affecting the developing world. He
announced plans for a special White House meeting
to strengthen incentives to work with the private
sector on common goals for fighting these diseases.

Responding to Threats and
Crises

Because our shaping efforts alone cannot guarantee
the international security environment we seek, the
United States must be able to respond at home and
abroad to the full spectrum of threats and crises that
may arise. Our resources are finite, so we must be
selective in our responses, focusing on challenges
that most directly affect our interests and engaging
where we can make the most difference. We must
use the most appropriate tool or combination of tools
— diplomacy, public diplomacy, economic measures,
law enforcement, military operations, and others. We
act in alliance or partnership when others share our
interests, but unilaterally when compelling national
interests so demand.

Efforts to deter an adversary — be it an aggressor
nation, terrorist group or criminal organization — can
become the leading edge of crisis response. In this
sense, deterrence straddles the line between shaping
the international environment and responding to
crises. Deterrence in crisis generally involves
signaling the United States’ commitment to a
particular country or interest by enhancing our
warfighting capability in the theater. We may also
choose to make additional statements to
communicate the costs of aggression or coercion to
an adversary, and in some cases may choose to
employ U.S. forces to underline the message and
deter further adventurism.

Transnational Threats

Transnational threats include terrorism, drug
trafficking and other international crime, and illegal
trade in fissile materials and other dangerous
substances.

14

 

Terrorism

The United States has made concerted efforts to
deter and punish terrorists, and remains determined
to apprehend and bring to justice those who terrorize
American citizens. We make no concessions to
terrorists. We fully exploit all available legal
mechanisms to punish international terrorists,
eliminate foreign terrorists and their support networks
in our country, and extend the reach of financial
sanctions to international terrorist support networks.
And we seek to eliminate terrorist sanctuaries
overseas, counter state support for terrorism, and
help other governments improve their capabilities to
combat terrorism.

To respond to terrorism incidents overseas, the State
Department leads an interagency team, the Foreign
Emergency Support Team (FEST), which is prepared
to deploy on short notice to the scene of an incident.
FEST teams are tailored to the nature of the event
and include personnel from the State Department,
Defense Department, FBI, and other agencies as
appropriate. Additionally, the FBI has five Rapid
Deployment Teams ready to respond quickly to
terrorist events anywhere in the world. The State
Department is also working on agreements with other
nations on response to WMD incidents overseas.

Whenever possible, we use law enforcement and
diplomatic tools to wage the fight against terrorism.
But there have been, and will be, times when those
tools are not enough. As long as terrorists continue
to target American citizens, we reserve the right to
act in self-defense by striking at their bases and
those who sponsor, assist or actively support them.

On August 20, 1998, acting on convincing information
from a variety of reliable sources that the network of
radical groups affiliated with Osama bin Laden had
planned, financed and carried out the bombings of
our embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, and
planned future attacks against Americans, the U.S.
Armed Forces carried out strikes on one of the most
active terrorist bases in the world. Located in
Afghanistan, it contained key elements of the bin
Laden network's infrastructure and has served as a
training camp for literally thousands of terrorists from
around the globe. We also struck a plant in
Khartoum, Sudan, that was linked by intelligence
information to chemical weapons and to the bin
Laden terror network. The strikes were a necessary

and proportionate response to the imminent threat of
further terrorist attacks against U.S. personnel and
facilities, and demonstrated that no country can be a
safe haven for terrorists.

Drug Trafficking and Other International
Crime

A broad range of criminal activities emanating from
overseas threatens the safety and well-being of the
American people.

Drug Trafficking. We have shown that with
determined and relentless efforts, we can make
significant progress against the scourge of drug
abuse and drug trafficking. For much of this century,
organized crime leaders inside the United States
controlled America’s drug trade. Aggressive law
enforcement efforts have dramatically weakened U.S.
crime syndicates. But international trade in drugs
persists; now led by criminals based in foreign
countries. International drug syndicates, especially
those based in Mexico and Colombia, continue to
diversify and seek new markets in the United States
— moving beyond large cities into smaller
communities and rural towns.

The aim of our drug control strategy is to cut illegal
drug use and availability in the United States by 50
percent by 2007 — and reduce the health and social
consequences of drug use and trafficking by 25
percent over the same period, through expanded
prevention efforts, improved treatment programs,
strengthened law enforcement and tougher
interdiction. Our strategy recognizes that, at home
and abroad, prevention, treatment and economic
alternatives must be integrated with intelligence
collection, law enforcement and interdiction efforts.

Domestically, we seek to educate and enable
America’s youth to reject illegal drugs, increase the
safety of America’s citizens by substantially reducing
drug-related crime and violence, reduce health and
social costs to the public of illegal drug use, reduce
domestic cultivation of cannabis and production of
methamphetamines and other synthetic drugs, and
shield America’s air, land and sea frontiers from the
drug threat. Concerted efforts by the public, all levels
of government and the private sector together with
other governments, private groups and international
organizations will be required for our strategy to
succeed.

 

Internationally, our strategy recognizes that the most
effective counterdrug operations are mounted at the
source where illegal drugs are grown and produced.
We seek to stop drug trafficking by bolstering the
capabilities of source nations to reduce cultivation
through eradication and development of alternative
crops, and attack production through destruction of
laboratories and control of chemicals used to produce
illegal drugs. In the transit zone between source
regions and the U.S. border, we support interdiction
programs to halt the shipment of illicit drugs. In
concert with allies abroad, we pursue prosecution of
major drug traffickers, destruction of drug trafficking
organizations, prevention of money laundering, and
elimination of criminal financial support networks.

Our strategy also includes efforts to build cooperative
links with foreign law enforcement agencies,
strengthen democratic institutions, assist source
nations to root out corruption, and safeguard human
rights and respect for the rule of law in both source
and transit nations. Additionally, we are engaging
international organizations, financial institutions and
non-governmental organizations in counterdrug
cooperation.

Other International Crime. A free and efficient
market economy requires transparency and effective
law enforcement to combat unlawful activities such
as extortion and corruption that impede rational
business decisions and fair competition. The benefits
of open markets are enhanced by fostering the safe
and secure international movement of passengers
and goods by all modes of transportation.
Additionally, the integrity and reliability of the
international financial system will be improved by
standardizing laws and regulations governing
financial institutions and improving international law
enforcement cooperation in the financial sector.
Corruption and extortion activities by organized crime
groups can also undermine the integrity of
government and imperil fragile democracies. And the
failure of governments to effectively control
international crime rings within their borders — or their
willingness to harbor international criminals —
endangers global stability. There must be no safe
haven where criminals can roam free, beyond the
reach of our extradition and legal assistance treaties.

We are negotiating and implementing new and
updated extradition and mutual legal assistance
treaties, and increasing our enforcement options
through agreements on asset seizure, forfeiture, and

15

money laundering. The new National Money
Laundering Strategy being implemented by the
Departments of Treasury and Justice is increasing
the effectiveness of America’s efforts both
domestically and internationally to deprive organized
crime groups the benefit of their illegal profits.
Initiatives also are under way to accelerate the
criminal identification process and facilitate global
participation in the investigation and prosecution of
criminal activities through the linking of worldwide law
enforcement databases. This will be done ina
manner that protects the privacy of U.S. citizens.

Because of the global nature of information networks,
no area of criminal activity has greater international
implications than high technology crime. Computer
hackers and other cyber-criminals are not hampered
by international boundaries, since information and
transactions involving funds or property can be
transmitted quickly and covertly via telephone and
information systems. Many of the challenges that law
enforcement faces in this area are extremely difficult
to address without international consensus and
cooperation. We seek to develop and implement
new agreements and encourage cooperative
research and development with other nations to
address high technology crime, particularly cyber-
crime.

Defending the Homeland

Our potential enemies, whether nations or terrorists,
may be more likely in the future to resort to attacks
against vulnerable civilian targets in the United
States. At the same time, easier access to
sophisticated technology means that the destructive
power available to rogue nations and terrorists is
greater than ever. Adversaries may be tempted to
use long-range ballistic missiles or unconventional
tools, such as WMD, financial destabilization, or
information attacks, to threaten our citizens and
critical national infrastructures at home.

The United States will act to deter or prevent such
attacks and, if attacks occur despite those efforts, will
be prepared to defend against them, limit the damage
they cause, and respond effectively against the
perpetrators. At home, we will forge an effective
partnership of Federal, state and local government
agencies, industry and other private sector
organizations.

16

 

National Missile Defense

We are committed to meeting the growing danger
posed by nations developing and deploying long-
range missiles that could deliver weapons of mass
destruction against the United States. Informed by
the Intelligence Community’s analysis of the August
1998 North Korean flight test of its Taepo Dong |
missile, as well as the report of the Rumsfeld
Commission and other information, the
Administration has concluded that the threat posed
by a rogue state developing an ICBM capable of
striking the United States is growing. The
Intelligence Community estimates that during the
next fifteen years the United States will most likely
face an ICBM threat from North Korea, probably from
Iran, and possibly from Iraq.

We intend to determine in 2000 whether to deploy a
limited national missile defense against ballistic
missile threats to the United States from rogue
states. The Administration's decision will be based
on an assessment of the four factors that must be
taken into account in deciding whether to field this
system: (1) whether the threat is materializing; (2) the
status of the technology based on an initial series of
rigorous flight tests, and the proposed system's
operational effectiveness; (3) whether the system is
affordable; and (4) the implications that going forward
with NMD deployment would hold for the overall
strategic environment and our arms control
objectives, including efforts to achieve further
reductions in strategic nuclear arms under START II
and START III.

In making our decision, we will review progress in
achieving our arms control objectives, including
negotiating changes to the ABM Treaty that would
permit the deployment of a limited NMD system. At
the Cologne G-8 Summit in June 1999, Presidents
Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to begin discussions on
START III and the ABM Treaty. Their reaffirmation
that under the ABM Treaty the two sides are
obligated to consider possible changes in the
strategic situation that have a bearing on the Treaty
and possible proposals for further increasing the
viability of the Treaty opened the door for discussion
of proposals for modifying the Treaty to
accommodate a limited NMD deployment. The
United States will attempt to negotiate changes to the
ABM Treaty that would be necessary if we decide to
deploy a limited NMD system. At the same time, the

Administration has made clear that it will not give any
state a veto over any missile defense deployment
decision that is vital to our national security interests.

Countering Foreign Intelligence
Collection

The United States is a primary target of foreign
intelligence services due to our military, scientific,
technological and economic preeminence. Foreign
intelligence services aggressively seek information
about U.S. political and military intentions and
capabilities, and are stepping up their efforts to
collect classified or sensitive information on U.S.
weapons systems, emerging technologies with
military applications, and related technical methods.
Such information enables potential adversaries to
counter U.S. political and military objectives, develop
sophisticated weapons more quickly and efficiently,
and develop countermeasures against U.S. weapons.
Intelligence collection against U.S. economic,
commercial and proprietary information enables
foreign states and corporations to obtain shortcuts to
industrial development and improve their
competitiveness against U.S. corporations in global
markets. Although difficult to quantify, economic and
industrial espionage result in the loss of millions of
dollars and thousands of jobs annually.

To protect sensitive national security information, we
must be able to effectively counter the collection
efforts of foreign intelligence services through
vigorous counterintelligence efforts and security
programs. Over the last five years, we have created
new counterintelligence mechanisms to address
economic and industrial espionage and implemented
procedures to improve coordination among
intelligence, counterintelligence and law enforcement
agencies. These measures have considerably
strengthened our ability to counter the foreign
intelligence collection threat. We will continue to
refine and enhance our counterintelligence
capabilities as we enter the twenty-first century.

Domestic Preparedness Against
Weapons of Mass Destruction

The Federal Government will respond rapidly and
decisively to any terrorist incident in the United States
involving WMD, working with state and local
governments to restore order and deliver emergency

 

assistance. The Domestic Terrorism Program is
integrating the capabilities and assets of a number of
Federal agencies to support the FBI, FEMA, the
Department of Health and Human Services, and state
and local governments in crisis response and
managing the consequences of a WMD incident. We
continue to develop and refine a comprehensive
strategy to protect our civilian population from
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. We are
upgrading our public health and medical surveillance
systems to enhance our preparedness for a biological
or chemical weapons attack, and helping to ensure
that federal, state and local emergency response
personnel have the resources they need to deal with
such a crisis.

Critical Infrastructure Protection

Our national security and our economic prosperity
rest on a foundation of critical infrastructures,
including telecommunications, energy, banking and
finance, transportation, water systems and
emergency services. These infrastructures are
vulnerable to computer-generated and physical
attacks. More than any nation, America is dependent
on cyberspace. We know that other governments
and terrorist groups are creating sophisticated, well-
organized capabilities to launch cyber-attacks against
critical American information networks and the
infrastructures that depend on them.

The President has directed that a plan for defending
our critical infrastructures be in effect by May 2001,
and fully operational by December 2003. Through
this plan we will achieve and maintain the ability to
protect our critical infrastructures from intentional acts
that would significantly diminish the ability of the
Federal Government to perform essential national
security missions. This plan will also help ensure the
general public health and safety; protect the ability of
state and local governments to maintain order and to
deliver minimum essential public services; and work
with the private sector to ensure the orderly
functioning of the economy and the delivery of
essential telecommunications, energy, financial and
transportation services.

The Federal government is committed to building this
capability to defend our critical infrastructures, but it
cannot do it alone. The private sector, as much as
the Federal government, is a target for infrastructure
attacks, whether by cyber or other means. A new

17

partnership between the Federal government and the
private sector is required. Acting jointly, we will work
to identify and eliminate significant vulnerabilities in
our critical infrastructures and the information
systems that support them.

We are creating the systems necessary to detect and
respond to attacks before they can cause serious
damage. For the first time, law enforcement,
intelligence agencies and the private sector will
share, in a manner consistent with U.S. law,
information about cyber-threats, vulnerabilities and
attacks. The Government is developing and
deploying new intrusion detection network
technologies to protect Defense Department and
other critical Federal systems, and we are
encouraging the private sector to develop and deploy
appropriate protective technology as well. A
nationwide system for quickly reconstituting in the
face of a serious cyber-attack is being developed.
Every Federal Department is also developing a plan
to protect its own critical infrastructures, which
include both cyber and physical dimensions.

Finally, we will be building a strong foundation for
continued protection of our critical infrastructures:
increased Federal R&D in information security,
increased investment in training and educating cyber-
security practitioners, and evaluating whether
legislation is necessary to protect both our civil
liberties and our critical infrastructures.

National Security Emergency
Preparedness

We will do all we can to deter and prevent destructive
and threatening forces such as terrorism, WMD use,
disruption of our critical infrastructures, and regional
or state-centered threats from endangering our
citizens. But if an emergency occurs, we must be
prepared to respond effectively at home and abroad
to protect lives and property, mobilize the personnel,
resources and capabilities necessary to effectively
handle the emergency, and ensure the survival of our
institutions and infrastructures. To this end, we will
sustain our efforts to maintain comprehensive, all-
hazard emergency planning by federal departments,
agencies and the military, as well as a strong and
responsive industrial and technology base, as crucial
national security emergency preparedness
requirements.

18

 

Smaller-Scale Contingencies

In addition to defending the U.S. homeland, the
United States must be prepared to respond to the full
range of threats to our interests abroad. Smaller-
scale contingency operations encompass the full
range of military operations short of major theater
warfare, including humanitarian assistance, peace
operations, enforcing embargoes and no-fly zones,
evacuating U.S. citizens, and reinforcing key allies.
These operations will likely pose frequent challenges
for U.S. military forces and cumulatively require
significant commitments over time. These operations
will also put a premium on the ability of the U.S.
military to work closely and effectively with other U.S.
Government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, regional and international security
organizations and coalition partners.

It often will be in our national interest to proceed in
partnership with other nations to preserve, maintain
and restore peace. American participation in peace
operations takes many forms, such as the NATO-led
coalitions in Bosnia and Kosovo, the American-led
UN force in Haiti, the recently concluded Military
Observer Mission Ecuador and Peru (MOMEP), our
participation in the coalition operation in the Sinai,
military observers in UN missions in Western Sahara,
Georgia and the Middle East, and the UN mission in
East Timor.

The question of command and control in multinational
contingency operations is particularly critical. Under
no circumstances will the President ever relinquish
his constitutional command authority over U.S.
forces, but there may be times in the future, just as in
the past, when it is in our interest to place U.S. forces
under the temporary operational control of a
competent allied or United Nations commander.

Not only must the U.S. military be prepared to
successfully conduct multiple smaller-scale
contingencies worldwide, it must be prepared to do
so in the face of challenges such as terrorism,
information operations and the threat or use of WMD.
U.S. forces must also remain prepared to withdraw
from contingency operations if needed to deploy to a
major theater war. Accordingly, appropriate U.S.
forces will be kept at a high level of readiness and will
be trained, equipped and organized to be capable of
performing multiple missions at one time.

Major Theater Warfare

Fighting and winning major theater wars is the
ultimate test of our Armed Forces — a test at which
they must always succeed. For the foreseeable
future, the United States, preferably in concert with
allies, must have the capability to deter and, if
deterrence fails, defeat large-scale, cross-border
aggression in two distant theaters in overlapping time
frames. Maintaining a two major theater war
capability reassures our friends and allies and makes
coalition relationships with the United States more
attractive. It deters opportunism elsewhere when we
are heavily involved in deterring or defeating
aggression in one theater, or while conducting
multiple smaller-scale contingencies and
engagement activities in other theaters. It also
provides a hedge against the possibility that we might
encounter threats larger or more difficult than
expected. A strategy for deterring and defeating
aggression in two theaters ensures we maintain the
capability and flexibility to meet unknown future
threats, while continued global engagement helps
preclude such threats from developing.

Fighting and winning major theater wars entails three
challenging requirements. First, we must maintain
the ability to rapidly defeat initial enemy advances
short of the enemy’s objectives in two theaters, in
close succession. We must maintain this ability to
ensure that we can seize the initiative, minimize
territory lost before an invasion is halted and ensure
the integrity of our warfighting coalitions. Failure to
defeat initial enemy advances rapidly would make the
subsequent campaign to evict enemy forces from
captured territory more difficult, lengthy and costly,
and could undermine U.S. credibility and increase the
risk of conflict elsewhere.

Second, the United States must be prepared to fight
and win under conditions where an adversary may
use asymmetric means against us — unconventional
approaches that avoid or undermine our strengths
while exploiting our vulnerabilities. Because of our
conventional military dominance, adversaries are
likely to use asymmetric means, such as WMD,
information operations or terrorism. Such
asymmetric attacks could be used to disrupt the
critical logistics pipeline — from its origins in the
United States, along sea and air routes, at in-transit
refueling and staging bases, to its termination at

 

airfields, seaports and supply depots in theater — as
well as our forces deployed in the field.

We are enhancing the preparedness of our Armed
Forces to effectively conduct sustained operations
despite the presence, threat or use of WMD. These
efforts include development, procurement and
deployment of theater missile defense systems to
protect forward-deployed military personnel, as well
as improved intelligence collection capabilities,
heightened security awareness and force protection
measures worldwide. We are also enhancing our
ability to defend against hostile information
operations, which could in the future take the form of
a full-scale, strategic information attack against our
critical national infrastructures, government and
economy — as well as attacks directed against our
military forces.

Third, our military must also be able to transition to
fighting major theater wars from a posture of global
engagement — from substantial levels of peacetime
engagement overseas as well as multiple concurrent
smaller-scale contingency operations. Withdrawing
from such operations would pose significant political
and operational challenges. Ultimately, however, the
United States must accept a degree of risk
associated with withdrawing from contingency
operations and engagement activities in order to
reduce the greater risk incurred if we failed to
respond adequately to major theater wars.

The Decision to Employ Military
Forces

The decision whether to use force is dictated first and
foremost by our national interests. In those specific
areas where our vital interests are at stake, our use
of force will be decisive and, if necessary, unilateral.

In situations posing a threat to important national
interests, military forces should only be used if they
advance U.S. interests, they are likely to accomplish
their objectives, the costs and risks of their
employment are commensurate with the interests at
stake, and other non-military means are incapable of
achieving our objectives. Such uses of military forces
should be selective and limited, reflecting the
importance of the interests at stake. We act in
concert with the international community whenever

19

possible, but do not hesitate to act unilaterally when
necessary.

The decision to employ military forces to support our
humanitarian and other interests focuses on the
unique capabilities and resources the military can
bring to bear, rather than on its combat power.
Generally, the military is not the best tool for
humanitarian concerns, but under certain conditions
use of our Armed Forces may be appropriate. Those
conditions are when the scale of a humanitarian
catastrophe dwarfs the ability of civilian relief
agencies to respond, when the need for relief is
urgent and only the military has the ability to provide
an immediate response, when the military is needed
to establish the preconditions necessary for effective
application of other instruments of national power,
when a humanitarian crisis could affect U.S. combat
operations, or when a response otherwise requires
unique military resources. Such efforts by the United
States, preferably in conjunction with other members
of the international community, will be limited in
duration, have a clearly defined mission and end
state, entail minimal risk to American lives, and be
designed to give the affected country the opportunity
to restore its own basic services.

In all cases, the costs and risks of U.S. military
involvement must be commensurate with the
interests at stake. We will be more inclined to act
where there is reason to believe that our action will
bring lasting improvement. Our involvement will be
more circumscribed when regional states or
organizations are better positioned to act than we
are. Even in these cases, however, the United
States will be actively engaged with appropriate
diplomatic, economic and military tools.

In every case, we will consider several critical
questions before committing military force: Have we
explored or exhausted non-military means that offer a
reasonable chance of achieving our goals? Is there a
clearly defined, achievable mission? What is the
threat environment and what risks will our forces
face? What level of effort will be needed to achieve
our goals? What are the potential costs—human and
financial—of the operation? What are the opportunity
costs in terms of maintaining our capability to
respond to higher-priority contingencies? Do we
have milestones and a desired end state to guide a
decision on terminating the mission?

Having decided that use of military forces is
appropriate, the decision on how they will be

20

 

employed is based on two guidelines. First, our
forces will have a clear mission and the means to
achieve their objectives decisively. Second, as much
as possible, we will seek the support and
participation of our allies, friends and relevant
international institutions. When our vital interests are
at stake, we are prepared to act alone. But in most
situations, working with other nations increases the
effectiveness of each nation's actions and lessens
everyone's burden.

Sustaining our engagement abroad over the long
term will require the support of the American people
and the Congress to bear the costs of defending U.S.
interests — including the risk of losing American lives.
Some decisions to engage abroad with our military
forces could well face popular opposition, but must
ultimately be judged by whether they advance the
interests of the American people in the long run.
When it is judged to be in America’s interest to
intervene, we must remain clear in our purposes and
resolute in our actions.

Preparing for an Uncertain
Future

We must prepare for an uncertain future even as we
address today's security problems. We need to look
closely at our national security apparatus to ensure
its effectiveness by adapting its institutions to meet
new challenges. This means we must transform our
capabilities and organizations — diplomatic, defense,
intelligence, law enforcement, and economic — to act
swiftly and to anticipate new opportunities and threats
in today’s continually evolving, highly complex
international security environment. Preparing for an
uncertain future also means that we must have a
strong, competitive, technologically superior,
innovative and responsive industrial and research
and development base.

Within the military, transformation requires that we
strike a balance among funding three critical
priorities: maintaining the ability of our forces to
shape and respond today, modernizing to protect the
long-term readiness of the force, and transforming
our unparalleled capabilities to ensure we can
effectively shape and respond in the future.
Transformation also means taking prudent steps to
position ourselves to effectively counter unlikely but
significant future threats, particularly asymmetric

threats. We also must work with Allies and coalition
partners to help improve their defense capabilities
and interoperability with our forces, in order to bolster
the effectiveness of multinational operations across
the full spectrum of potential military missions.

Transformation of our military forces is critical to
meeting the military challenges of the next century.
Exploiting the revolution in military affairs is
fundamental if U.S. forces are to retain their
dominance in an uncertain world. Investment in
research and development while closely monitoring
trends in likely future threats are important elements
of our transformation effort. A carefully planned and
focused modernization program will maintain our
technological superiority and replace Cold War-era
equipment with new systems and platforms capable
of supporting the full spectrum of military operations.

Transformation extends well beyond the acquisition
of new military systems — we seek to leverage
technological, doctrinal, operational and
organizational innovations to give U.S. forces greater
capabilities and flexibility. Joint Forces Command
and the Armed Services are pursuing an aggressive,
wide-ranging innovation and experimentation
program to achieve that transformation. The on-
going integration of the Active and Reserve
components into a Total Force is another important
element of the transformation. Despite the rapid
pace of technological innovation, the human
dimension of warfare remains timeless. In this era of
multinational operations and complex threats
involving ethnic, religious, and cultural strife, regional
expertise, language proficiency, and cross-cultural
communications skills have never been more
important to the U.S. military. We will continue to
transform and modernize our forces, ensure the
quality of our personnel, and explore new ways of
optimizing the Total Force for future missions.

To support the readiness, modernization and
transformation of our military forces, we will work with
the Congress to enact legislation to implement the
Defense Reform Initiative, which will free up
resources through a revolution in business affairs.
This effort includes competitive sourcing, acquisition
reform, transformation of logistics, and elimination of
excess infrastructure through two additional base
realignment and closure rounds. The Administration,
in partnership with the Congress, will continue to
assure we maintain the best-trained, best-equipped

 

and best-led military force in the world for the twenty-
first century.

In the area of law enforcement, the United States is
already facing criminal threats that are much broader
in scope and much more sophisticated than those we
have confronted in the past. Ongoing technological
and economic revolutions such as the Internet and
globalization of markets offer extraordinary benefits,
but will also continue to present new dangers. We
must prepare for the law enforcement challenges
arising from emerging technology, globalization of
trade and finance, and other international dynamics.
Our strategy for the future calls for the development
of new investigative tools and approaches as well as
increased integration of effort among law
enforcement agencies at all levels of government,
both in America and abroad.

We will continue efforts to construct appropriate
twenty-first century national security programs and
structures government-wide. We will continue to
foster innovative approaches and organizational
structures to better protect American lives, property
and interests at home and abroad.

Promoting Prosperity

The second core objective of our national security
strategy is to promote America’s prosperity through
efforts at home and abroad. Our economic and
security interests are inextricably linked. Prosperity at
home depends on stability in key regions with which we
trade or from which we import critical commodities,
such as oil and natural gas. Prosperity also demands
our leadership in international development, financial
and trade institutions. In turn, the strength of our
diplomacy, our ability to maintain an unrivaled military
and the attractiveness of our values abroad depend in
large part on the strength of our economy.

Strengthening Financial
Coordination

As national economies become more integrated
internationally, U.S. prosperity depends more than
ever on economic developments abroad.
Cooperation with other states and international

21

organizations is vital to protecting the health of the
global economic system and responding to financial
crises.

Global financial markets dominated by private capital
flows provide both opportunities and risks, as
highlighted by the international financial crisis of the
past two years. Our goal is to build a stable, resilient
global financial system that promotes strong global
economic growth while providing broad benefits in all
countries. We have worked with our G-7 partners
and the rest of the international community to pursue
reforms in six broad areas: strengthening and
reforming international institutions and arrangements;
enhancing transparency and promoting best
practices; strengthening financial regulation in
industrial countries; strengthening macroeconomic
policies and financial systems in emerging markets;
improving crisis prevention and management, and
involving the private sector; and promoting social
policies to protect the poor and most vulnerable.

The United States has played an important role in
initiating a process of broader participation in
financial architecture discussions, especially to
include a substantial number of emerging market
economies. In furtherance of this goal, we agreed to
create the G-20 to provide a new mechanism for
informal dialogue in the framework of the Bretton
Woods institutional system to broaden the
discussions on key economic and financial policy
issues and promote cooperation to achieve stable
and sustainable world economic growth.

International financial institutions, particularly the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), have an important
role to play in building a stronger global financial
system. To ensure that it is better positioned to meet
the challenges of the changed world, we are pursuing
a number of IMF reforms, including: requiring greater
openness and transparency; building strong national
financial systems; promoting an appropriate role for
the private sector in preventing and resolving
financial crises; and giving greater attention in IMF
country programs to governance, poverty reduction,
social, labor, and environmental concerns.

Promoting an Open Trading
System

In a world where over 96 percent of the world’s
consumers live outside the United States, we must

22

 

continue to expand our international trade to sustain
economic growth at home. The rapidly expanding
global economy presents enormous opportunities for
American companies and workers, particularly in
emerging markets. Our prosperity as a nation in the
twenty-first century will depend upon our ability to
compete effectively in international markets.

The Administration remains committed to carrying
forward the success of the Uruguay Round under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),
and to the success of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) as a forum for openly resolving disputes. We
completed the Information Technology Agreement,
which goes far toward eliminating tariffs on high
technology products, and concluded a landmark
WTO agreement that will dramatically liberalize trade
in telecommunications services. The WTO agenda
includes further negotiations to reform agricultural
trade, liberalize service sector markets, encourage
unfettered development of electronic commerce, and
strengthen protection for intellectual property rights.

We also have a full agenda of accession negotiations
with economies seeking to join the WTO. The United
States is setting high standards for accession in
terms of adherence to the rules and market access.
Accessions offer an opportunity to help ground new
economies in the rules-based trading system and
reinforce their own reform programs.

An OECD Convention on criminalizing the bribery of
foreign officials entered into force in 1999. The
United States and 16 other countries are currently
parties. It provides for a monitoring process, based
on peer review, to evaluate parties’ implementation of
the Convention. As parties enact anti-bribery laws,
the tax deductibility of bribes to foreign officials will be
eliminated. We are seeking an agreement in the
WTO on transparency in government procurement.

We have also made important strides on labor issues.
WTO members have affirmed their commitment to
observing core labor standards: the right to organize
and bargain collectively, and prohibitions against
employment discrimination, child labor and forced
labor. We will continue pressing for better integration
of the international core labor standards into the WTO's
work, including through closer WTO interaction with the
International Labor Organization (ILO).

We will continue to ensure that liberalization of trade
does not come at the expense of national security or

environmental protection. For example, the national
security, law enforcement and trade policy communities
worked together to make sure that the WTO agreement
liberalizing global investment in telecommunications
was consistent with U.S. national security interests.
Moreover, our leadership in the Uruguay Round
negotiations led to the incorporation of environmental
provisions into the WTO agreements and creation of
the Committee on Trade and Environment, which
continues to pursue the goal of ensuring that trade and
environment policies are mutually supportive.

Although significant differences remain, we made
progress on this broad agenda at the recent WTO
Ministerial meeting in Seattle. We will work to ensure
that a new round of global trade talks includes
bringing down barriers in agriculture, manufacturing
and services, keeping electronic commerce tariff-free,
and ensuring that trade will lift living conditions for
working people everywhere while protecting the
environment. We remain determined to move
forward on the path of free trade and economic
growth while ensuring that a human face is put on the
global economy.

In addition to working in the WTO, the Administration
will continue to press for more open markets through
regional economic organizations — such as the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC), the
Transatlantic Economic Partnership, the President's
economic partnership with sub-Saharan Africa, and
the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).

Trade agreement implementing authority is essential
for advancing our nation’s economic interests.
Congress has consistently recognized that the
President must have the authority to break down
foreign trade barriers and create good jobs.
Accordingly, the Administration will continue to work
with Congress to fashion an appropriate grant of fast
track authority.

Enhancing American
Competitiveness

Gaining full benefit of more open markets requires an
integrated strategy that maintains our technological
advantages, promotes American exports abroad, and
ensures that export controls intended to protect our
national security do not unnecessarily make U.S. high
technology companies less competitive globally.

 

Technological advantage. We will continue to
support a vigorous science and technology base that
promotes economic growth, creates high-wage jobs,
sustains a healthy, educated citizenry, and provides the
basis for our future military systems. We will invest in
education and training to develop a workforce capable
of participating in our rapidly changing economy. And
we will invest in world-class transportation, information
and space infrastructures for the twenty-first century.

Export Advocacy. The Administration created
America’s first national export strategy, reforming the
way government works with the private sector to
expand exports. The Trade Promotion Coordination
Committee has been instrumental in improving export
promotion efforts, coordinating our export financing,
implementing a government-wide advocacy initiative,
and updating market information systems and product
standards education.

The export strategy is working, with the United States
regaining its position as the world’s largest exporter.
While our strong export performance has supported
millions of new, export-related jobs, we must export
more in the years ahead if we are to further strengthen
our trade balance position and raise living standards
with high-wage jobs.

Enhanced Export Control. The United States is a
world leader in high technology exports, including
satellites, cellular phones, computers, information
security, and commercial aircraft. Some of this
technology has direct or indirect military applications,
or may otherwise be used by states or transnational
organizations to threaten our national security. For
that reason, the United States government carefully
controls high technology exports by placing
appropriate restrictions on the sale of goods and
technologies that could be used for military purposes
or otherwise impair our security. These controls
recognize that in an increasingly competitive global
economy where there are many non-U.S. suppliers,
excessive restrictions will not limit the availability of
high technology goods. Rather, they would serve
only to make U.S. high technology companies less
competitive globally, thus losing market share and
becoming less able to produce cutting-edge products
for the U.S. military and our allies.

Our current policy recognizes that we must balance a
variety of factors. While acting to promote high

technology exports by making license decisions more
transparent, predictable and timely through a rigorous

23

licensing process administered by the Department of
Commerce, we also expanded review of dual-use
applications by the Departments of Defense, State
and Energy. If any of these agencies disagree with a
proposed export, it can put the issue into a dispute
resolution process that can ultimately rise to the
President. As a result, reviews of dual-use licenses
are today more thorough than ever before. In the
case of munitions exports, we are committed to a
policy of responsible restraint in the transfer of
conventional arms and technologies that could
contribute to WMD. A key goal in the years ahead is
to strengthen worldwide controls in those areas.

Encryption is an example of a specific technology
where careful balance is required. Export controls on
encryption must be considered as part of an overall
policy that balances several important national
interests, including promoting secure electronic
commerce, protecting privacy rights, supporting
public safety and national security interests, and
maintaining U.S. industry leadership. Over the past
year, the Administration, in consultation with industry
and privacy groups, conducted a review of its
encryption policy as well as foreign and domestic
markets, and announced an updated policy in
September 1999. While continuing a balanced
approach, the new policy significantly streamlines
export controls while protecting critical national
security interests. When the new encryption export
regulation is published in early 2000, U.S. companies
will be afforded new opportunities to sell their
encryption products without limits on key length to
global businesses, commercial organizations and
individuals. Most U.S. mass-market software
products, previously limited to 40 and 56 bit keys, will
be approved for export to any end user.

Similarly, computers are a technology where we must
apply export controls in a manner that addresses our
national security concerns and continues to help
strengthen America’s competitiveness. In doing so,
we face extraordinarily rapid technological changes.
Maintaining outdated controls on commodity level
computers would hurt U.S. companies without
benefiting our national security. Recognizing this, the
Administration announced reforms to export controls
on computers in July 1999 that permit higher levels of
computers to be sold to countries which are friendly
to the United States. For countries that present risks
from a national security viewpoint, the Administration
will continue its policy of maintaining a lower
threshold for military end-users than civilian end-

24

 

users. Export control agencies will review advances
in computer technology on an ongoing basis and will
provide the President with recommendations to
update computer export controls every six months.

U.S. efforts to stem proliferation cannot be effective
without the cooperation of other countries. We have
strengthened cooperation through the Nuclear
Suppliers Group, the Missile Technology Control
Regime, the Zangger Committee, the Australia Group
for the control of chemical and biological weapons-
related related items, and the Wassenaar
Arrangement for greater transparency in conventional
arms transfers. These efforts enlist the world
community in the battle against the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, advanced conventional
weapons and sensitive technologies, while at the
same time producing a level playing field for U.S.
business by ensuring that our competitors face
corresponding export controls.

Providing for Energy Security

The United States depends on oil for about 40 percent
of its primary energy needs, and roughly half of our oil
needs are met with imports. And although we import
less than 15% of the oil exported from the Persian Gulf,
our allies in Europe and Japan account for about 80%
of those exports. The United States is undergoing a
fundamental shift away from reliance on Middle East
oil. Venezuela is our number one foreign supplier, and
Africa supplies 15% of our imported oil. Canada,
Mexico and Venezuela combined supply almost twice
as much oil to the United States as the Arab OPEC
countries. The Caspian Basin, with potential oil
reserves of 160 billion barrels, promises to play an
increasingly important role in meeting rising world
energy demand in coming decades.

Conservation measures and research leading to
greater energy efficiency and alternative fuels are a
critical element of the U.S. strategy for energy
security. Our research must continue to focus on
developing highly energy-efficient buildings,
appliances, and transportation and industrial
systems, shifting them where possible to alternative
or renewable fuels, such as hydrogen, fuel cell
technology, ethanol, or methanol from biomass.

Conservation and energy research notwithstanding, the
United States will continue to have a vital interest in

ensuring access to foreign oil sources. We must
continue to be mindful of the need for regional stability
and security in key producing areas to ensure our
access to, and the free flow of, these resources.

Promoting Sustainable
Development

Developing countries face an array of challenges in
their efforts to achieve broad-based economic and
social progress and participate more fully in the
opportunities presented by globalization. Poor
environmental and natural resource management can
impede sustainable development efforts and promote
regional instability. Many nations are struggling to
provide jobs, education and other services to their
citizens. Three billion people, half the world’s
population, subsist on less than two dollars a day. Their
continued poverty leads to hunger, malnutrition,
economic migration and political unrest. Malaria, AIDS
and other epidemics, including some that can spread
through environmental damage, threaten to overwhelm
the health facilities of developing countries, disrupt
societies and economic growth, and spread disease to
other parts of the world.

Sustainable development brings higher incomes and
more open markets that create steadily expanding
opportunities for U.S. trade and investment. It
improves the prospects for democracy and social
stability in developing countries and increases global
economic growth, on which the demand for U.S.
exports depends. It alleviates pressure on the global
environment, reduces the attraction of the illegal drug
trade and other illicit commerce, and improves health
and economic productivity. U.S. foreign assistance
focuses on five key elements of sustainable
development: broad-based economic growth, human
capacity development, environmental protection,
population and health, and democracy. We will
continue to advocate environmentally sound private
investment and responsible approaches by
international lenders.

Promoting Democracy and
Human Rights

The third core objective of our national security
strategy is to promote democracy, human rights, and

 

respect for the rule of law. In the past decade, the
movement of nations away from repressive
governance and toward democratic and publicly
accountable institutions has been extraordinary. Since
the success of many of those changes is by no means
assured, our strategy must focus on strengthening the
commitment and capacity of nations to implement
democratic reforms, protect human rights, fight
corruption and increase transparency in government.

Emerging Democracies

The United States works to strengthen democratic and
free market institutions and norms in all countries,
particularly those making the transition from closed to
open societies. This commitment to see freedom and
respect for human rights take hold is not only just, but
pragmatic. Our security depends upon the protection
and expansion of democracy worldwide, without which
repression, corruption and instability could engulf a
number of countries and threaten the stability of entire
regions.

The sometimes-difficult road for new democracies in
the 1990’s demonstrates that free elections are not
enough. Genuine, lasting democracy also requires
respect for human rights, including the right to political
dissent; freedom of religion and belief; an independent
media capable of engaging an informed citizenry; a
robust civil society; the rule of law and an independent
judiciary; open and competitive economic structures;
mechanisms to safeguard minorities from oppressive
rule by the majority; full respect for women’s and
workers’ rights; and civilian control of the military.

The United States is helping consolidate democratic
and market reforms in Central and Eastern Europe
and the newly independent states of the former Soviet
Union. Integrating new democracies in Europe into
European political, economic and security
organizations, such as NATO, OSCE, the EU and the
Council of Europe, will help lock in and preserve the
impressive progress these nations have made in
instituting democratic and market-economic reforms.
Consolidating advances in democracy and free
markets in our own hemisphere remain a priority. In
the Asia Pacific region, economic dynamism is
increasingly associated with political modernization,
democratic evolution, and the widening of the rule of
law. Indonesia’s October 1999 election was a
significant step toward democracy and we will do our
part to help Indonesia continue on that path. In

25

Africa, we are particularly attentive to states, such as
South Africa and Nigeria, whose entry into the
community of market democracies may influence the
future direction of an entire region.

The methods for assisting emerging democracies are
as varied as the nations involved. Our public
diplomacy programs are designed to share our
democratic experience in both government and civil
society with the publics in emerging democracies. We
must continue leading efforts to mobilize international
economic and political resources, as we have with
Russia, Ukraine and other countries in Eastern Europe
and Eurasia and with Southeast Europe. We must take
firm action to help counter attempts to reverse
democracy, as we have in Haiti and Paraguay.

We must help democratizing nations strengthen the
pillars of civil society, supporting administration of
justice and rule of law programs, promoting the
principle of civilian control of the military, and training
foreign police and security forces to solve crimes and
maintain order without violating the basic rights of
their citizens. And we must seek to improve their
market institutions and fight corruption and political
discontent by encouraging good governance practices
and a free and independent local media that promotes
these principles.

Adherence to Universal Human
Rights and Democratic Principles

We must sustain our efforts to press for adherence to
democratic principles, and respect for basic human
rights and the rule of law worldwide, including in
countries that continue to defy democratic advances.
Working bilaterally and through international
institutions, the United States promotes universal
adherence to democratic principles and international
standards of human rights. Our efforts in the United
Nations and other organizations are helping to make
these principles the governing standards for
acceptable international behavior.

Ethnic conflict represents a great challenge to our
values and our security. When it erupts in ethnic
cleansing or genocide, ethnic conflict is a grave
violation of universal human rights. Innocent civilians
should not be subject to forcible relocation or
slaughter because of their religious, ethnic, racial, or
tribal heritage. In addition to being a cause for

26

 

concern on humanitarian grounds, ethnic conflict can
threaten regional stability and may give rise to
potentially serious national security concerns.

We will work to strengthen the capacity of the
international community to prevent and, whenever
possible, stop outbreaks of mass killing and
displacement. The United States and other countries
cannot respond to every humanitarian crisis in the
world. But when the world community has the power
to stop genocide and ethnic cleansing, we will work
with our allies and partners, and with the United
Nations, to mobilize against such violence — as we
did in Bosnia and Kosovo.

Our response will not be the same in every case.
Sometimes collective military action is both
appropriate and feasible. Sometimes concerted
economic and political pressure, combined with
diplomacy, is a better answer. The way the
international community responds will depend upon
the capacity of countries to act, and on their
perception of their national interests.

Events in the Bosnia conflict and preceding the 1994
genocide in Rwanda demonstrate the unfortunate
power of inaccurate and malicious information in
conflict-prone situations. We must enhance our ability
to make effective use of our communications and
information capabilities to counter misinformation and
incitement, mitigate ethnic conflict, promote
independent media organizations and the free flow of
information, and support democratic participation.

We will also continue to work — bilaterally and with
international institutions — to ensure that international
human rights principles protect the most vulnerable
or traditionally oppressed groups in the world —
women, children, workers, refugees and other
persecuted persons. To this end, we will seek to
strengthen international mechanisms that promote
human rights and address violations of international
humanitarian law, such as the UN Human Rights
Commission and the international war crimes tribunals
for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. We strongly
support wide ratification of the ILO Convention on the
Worst Forms of Child Labor. We also aim to
implement fully those international human rights
treaties to which we are a party.

It is our aim to ensure temporary protection for persons
fleeing situations of armed conflict or generalized
human rights abuses by encouraging governments to

not return refugees to countries where they face
persecution or torture. We also seek to focus
additional attention on the more vulnerable or
traditionally oppressed people by spearheading new
international initiatives to combat the sexual
exploitation of minors, child labor, homelessness
among children, and the use of child soldiers.

Violence against and trafficking in women and
children are international problems with national
implications. We have seen cases of trafficking in the
United States for purposes of forced prostitution,
sweatshop labor and domestic servitude. Our efforts
have expanded to combat this problem, both
nationally and internationally, by increasing
awareness, focusing on prevention, providing victim
assistance and protection, and enhancing law
enforcement. The President continues to call upon
the Senate to give its advice and consent to
ratification to the Convention on the Elimination of all
Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which will
enhance our efforts to combat violence against
women, reform unfair inheritance and property rights,
and strengthen women's access to fair employment
and economic opportunity.

Promotion of religious freedom is one of the highest
concerns in our foreign policy. Freedom of thought,
conscience and religion is a bedrock issue for the
American people. To that end, the President signed
the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which
provides the flexibility needed to advance religious
freedom and to counter religious persecution. In
September 1999, we completed the first phase outlined
in the Act with publication of the first annual report on
the status of religious freedom worldwide, and in
October, we designated the most severe violators of
religious freedom. The United States is active
throughout the world assisting those who are
persecuted because of their religion and promoting
freedom of religious belief and practice. We will
continue to work with individual nations and with
international institutions to combat religious
persecution and promote religious freedom.

The United States will continue to speak out against
human rights abuses and carry on human rights
dialogues with countries willing to engage with us
constructively. Because police and internal security
services can be a source of human rights violations,
we use training and contacts between U.S. law
enforcement and their foreign counterparts to help

 

address these problems. We do not provide training
to police or military units implicated in human rights
abuses. When appropriate, we are prepared to take
strong measures against human rights violators.
These include economic sanctions, visa restrictions
and restricting sales of arms and police equipment that
may be used to commit human rights abuses.

Humanitarian Activities

Our efforts to promote democracy and human rights
are complemented by our humanitarian programs,
which are designed to alleviate human suffering,
address resource and economic crises that could
have global implications, pursue appropriate
strategies for economic development, and support
and promote democratic regimes that respect human
rights and the rule of law.

We also must seek to promote reconciliation in states
experiencing civil conflict and to address migration and
refugee crises. To this end, the United States will
provide appropriate financial support and work with
other nations and international bodies, such as the
International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees. We also will assist
efforts to protect the rights of refugees and displaced
persons and to address the economic and social root
causes of internal displacement and international
flight.

Private firms and non-governmental organizations are
natural allies in activities and efforts intended to
address humanitarian crises and bolster democracy
and market economies. We have natural partners in
labor unions, human rights groups, environmental
advocates, chambers of commerce and election
monitors in promoting democracy and respect for
human rights and in providing international
humanitarian assistance; thus, we should promote
democratization efforts through private and non-
governmental groups as well as foreign governments.

Supporting the global movement toward democracy
requires a pragmatic, long-term effort focused on both
values and institutions. Our goal is a broadening of the
community of free-market democracies, and stronger
institutions and international non-governmental
movements committed to human rights and
democratization.

Ill. Integrated Regional Approaches

Our policies toward different regions reflect our overall
strategy tailored to their unique challenges and
opportunities.

Europe and Eurasia

European stability is vital to our own security. The
United States has two strategic goals in Europe. The
first is to build a Europe that is truly integrated,
democratic, prosperous and at peace -- a realization
of the vision the United States launched 50 years ago
with the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). Our second goal is to work
with our allies and partners across the Atlantic to
meet the global challenges no nation can meet alone.
This means working together to consolidate this
region’s historic transition in favor of democracy and
free markets; to support peace efforts in troubled
regions; to tackle global threats such as
environmental and health problems, terrorism, drug
trafficking, the spread of weapons of mass
destruction and other potentially dangerous
technologies; and to build a more open world
economy without barriers to transatlantic trade and
investment.

Enhancing Security

NATO remains the anchor of American engagement
in Europe and the linchpin of transatlantic security.
As the leading guarantor of European security and a
force for European stability, NATO must play a
leading role in promoting a more integrated and secure
Europe, prepared to respond to new challenges. We
will maintain approximately 100,000 military personnel
in Europe to fulfill our commitments to NATO, provide
a visible deterrent against aggression and coercion,
contribute to regional stability, respond to crises,
sustain our vital transatlantic ties and preserve U.S.
leadership in NATO.

 

NATO is pursuing several initiatives to enhance its
ability to respond to the new challenges it will face in
the twenty-first century. At NATO's Fiftieth
Anniversary Summit in April 1999, Alliance leaders
adopted an expansive agenda to adapt and prepare
NATO for current and future challenges. This
included an updated Strategic Concept, which
envisions a larger, more capable and more flexible
Alliance, committed to collective defense and able to
undertake new missions. The Defense Capabilities
Initiative aims to improve defense capabilities and
interoperability among NATO military forces, thus
bolstering the effectiveness of multinational
operations across the full spectrum of Alliance
missions, to include Partner forces where
appropriate. The WMD Initiative will increase Alliance
efforts against weapons of mass destruction and their
means of delivery.

NATO enlargement has been a crucial element of the
U.S. and Allied strategy to build an undivided,
peaceful Europe. At the April 1999 NATO Summit,
the alliance welcomed the entry of Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic as new members. These
three nations will make the Alliance stronger while
helping to enlarge Europe's zone of democratic
stability.

Together with our Allies, we are pursuing efforts to
help other countries that aspire to membership
become the best possible candidates. These efforts
include the NATO Membership Action Plan and our
Partnership for Peace. We are also continuing
bilateral programs to advance this agenda, such as
the President’s Warsaw Initiative, which is playing a
critical role in promoting Western-style reform of the
armed forces of Central and Eastern Europe and
Eurasia and helping them become more
interoperable with NATO. Some European nations
do not desire NATO membership, but do desire
strengthened ties with the Alliance. The Partnership
for Peace provides an ideal vehicle for such
relationships. It formalizes relations, provides a

29

mechanism for mutual beneficial interaction and
establishes a sound basis for combined action should
that be desired. This can be seen in the major
contributions some Partnership for Peace members
have made to NATO missions in the Balkans.

NATO is pursuing several other initiatives to enhance
its ability to respond to new challenges and deepen
ties between the Alliance and Partner countries.
NATO has launched the Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council to strengthen political dialogue and practical
cooperation with all Partners, and established a
distinctive partnership with Ukraine, which provides a
framework for enhanced relations and practical
cooperation. As a result of the 1997 NATO-Russia
Founding Act, NATO and Russia launched the
Permanent Joint Council to enhance political
consultation and practical cooperation, while retaining
NATO's decision-making authority. Our shared goal
remains to deepen and expand constructive Russian
participation in the European security system.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) has a key role to play in enhancing
Europe’s stability. It provides the United States with
a venue for developing Europe's security architecture
in a manner that complements our NATO strategy. In
many instances, cooperating through the OSCE to
secure peace, deter aggression, and prevent, defuse
and manage crises offers a comparative advantage
because it is more cost effective than unilateral
action. The November 1999 Istanbul OSCE Summit
agreed on principles and modalities to further such
cooperation in the Charter on European Security.
The Charter commits members to, among other
things, the establishment of Rapid Expert Assistance
and Cooperation Teams to assist in conflict
prevention and crisis management. The Charter also
recognizes that European security in the twenty-first
century increasingly depends on building security
within societies as well as security between states.
The United States will continue to give strong support
to the OSCE as our best choice to engage all the
countries of Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia
in an effort to advance democracy, human rights and
the rule of law, and to encourage them to support one
another when instability, insecurity and human rights
violations threaten peace in the region.

The Balkans and Southeastern Europe: The
United States has an abiding interest in peace in this
region because continued instability there threatens
European security. We are working to advance the

30

 

integration of several new democracies in
Southeastern Europe (Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria,
Croatia, Macedonia, Romania, and Slovenia) into the
European mainstream. More specifically, the
President's Action Plan for Southeast Europe seeks
to promote further democratic, economic and military
reforms in these countries, to encourage greater
regional cooperation, advance common interests,
such as closer contact with NATO, and increased law
enforcement training and exchanges to assist in the
fight against organized crime. We are working to
promote increased security cooperation among
NATO Allies and Partners in the region through the
Southeast Europe Defense Ministerial process and
NATO’s Southeast Europe Initiative. We are also
working with the region, the EU and others to
strengthen overall democratization, economic
development and security through the Stability Pact
for Southeastern Europe, initiated by the EU and
launched by President Clinton and other leaders at
Sarajevo in July 1999. The Pact also seeks to
deepen regional cooperation and draw those
countries closer to the rest of Europe and the United
States, thereby giving them an opportunity to
demonstrate that they are ready for integration into
Euro-Atlantic institutions.

Kosovo and Serbia-Montenegro: After this year’s
successful NATO intervention in Kosovo, the stability
of the Balkans is still threatened by the vestiges of
ethnic hatred and political repression. As the United
States and NATO remain engaged in helping the
people of the region build a stable and secure future
for the Balkans, we remain prepared to address
renewed threats to the region’s stability.
Constitutional challenges between Serbia and a
democratic and reform-minded Montenegro pose a
danger for renewed conflict. And in Kosovo, the last
decade of Serbia’s systemic repression of Kosovar
Albanians leaves a volatile mixture of
disenfranchisement, displacement and revenge-
seekers.

NATO military operations against Serbia in the spring
of 1999 had three clear goals: the withdrawal of all
Serb military, paramilitary, and police forces from
Kosovo; the unconditional and safe return of all
refugees and displaced persons to Kosovo; and
deployment of an international security force, with
NATO at its core, to protect all the people of Kosovo
-- Serbs, Albanians and others. Those goals were
achieved. Now, NATO, the UN and the international
community face the challenge of establishing a stable

environment that provides for the security and dignity
of all people in Kosovo. Much has been achieved to
this end. Mine fields are being cleared; homes are
being rebuilt; nearly a million Kosovars who returned
to the province are receiving food, shelter and
medicine; investigations into the fate of the missing
are ongoing; and the Kosovar Liberation Army has
been demilitarized.

Over 48,000 troops from 30 countries have
participated in the Kosovo Force (KFOR). Our
European allies have provided the vast majority of
them; America will continue to contribute about
7,000. Russian and other non-NATO participation in
KFOR remains an important demonstration of
international commitment and provides reassurance
to all the people of Kosovo that they will live in peace
and security. KFOR continues to operate under
NATO command and control and rules of
engagement set by NATO. It has the means and the
mandate to protect itself while doing its job. Under
the security environment established by KFOR, the
United Nations has established an interim civilian
administration and a 4,700-person international
police force that will assist the Kosovars in building
institutions of self-government. As local institutions
take hold, and as international and indigenous police
forces establish law and order, NATO will be able to
turn over increasing responsibility to them.

A final challenge will be to encourage Serbia to join
its neighbors in this historic journey to a peaceful,
democratic, united Europe. But as long as Slobodan
Milosevic remains in power we will not provide
support for the reconstruction of Serbia. We are
providing humanitarian aid, and will be willing to help
build a better future for Serbia when its government
represents tolerance and freedom, not repression
and terror. We are also providing support for
democratic forces in Serbia to strengthen
independent political parties and a free media, and to
accelerate Serbia's transition to democracy.

Bosnia and Croatia: Full implementation of the
Dayton Accords is the best hope for creating a self-
sustaining peace in Bosnia. NATO-led forces are
contributing to a secure environment in Bosnia and
providing essential support for broader progress in
implementing the Dayton Accords. However, further
progress is necessary to create conditions that will
allow implementation to continue without a major
international military presence. We continue to
support the efforts of the International Criminal Tribunal

 

for the former Yugoslavia by assisting in the location,
detention and transfer of suspected war criminals, and
supporting the international community's efforts to
eliminate corruption, expose outside influence, facilitate
the return of refugees, and promote justice and
reconciliation in Bosnia. We are working to accelerate
market economic reforms in Bosnia and Croatia and
support a transition to democracy in Croatia.

Cyprus and the Aegean: Tensions on Cyprus,
Greek-Turkish disagreements in the Aegean and
Turkey's relationship with the EU have serious
implications for regional stability and the evolution of
European political and security structures. Our goals
are to stabilize the region by reducing long-standing
Greek-Turkish tensions and pursuing a comprehensive
settlement on Cyprus. A democratic, secular, stable
and Western-oriented Turkey is critical to these efforts
and has supported broader U.S. efforts to enhance
stability in Bosnia, the nations of the former Soviet
Union and the Middle East, as well as to contain Iran
and Iraq. The President's recent trip to Turkey and
Greece highlighted encouraging signs of progress for
reconciliation in the region, including talks on the
Cyprus dispute that are being held under the auspices
of the UN in New York. The EU's historic decision at its
Helsinki Summit to grant candidate status to Turkey
reinforced this positive trend.

The Baltic States: The special nature of our
relationship with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania is
recognized in the 1998 Charter of Partnership, which
clarifies the principles upon which U.S. relations with
the Baltic states are based and provides a framework
for strengthening ties and pursuing common goals.
These goals include integration of Latvia, Lithuania
and Estonia into the transatlantic community and
development of close, cooperative relationships
among all the states in Northeastern Europe.
Through the Northern European Initiative we seek to
strengthen regional cooperation, enhance regional
security and stability, and promote the growth of
Western institutions, trade and investment by
bringing together the governments and private sector
interests in the Baltic and Nordic countries, Poland,
Germany and Russia.

Northern Ireland: Historic progress was achieved in
implementing the Good Friday Accord when, on
December 2, 1999, an inclusive power-sharing
government was formed in Northern Ireland, the
principle of consent was accepted with respect to any

31

change in the territorial status of Northern Ireland,
new institutions were launched for North-South
cooperation on the island of Ireland, and the Irish
Republican Army named a representative to the
Independent International Commission on
Decommissioning of paramilitary weapons (loyalist
paramilitaries named their representatives to the
commission soon thereafter). These developments
followed continued progress in promoting human
rights and equality in Northern Ireland, including the
important recommendations put forward for police
reform in the Patten Report issued on September 9,
1999.

The United States continues to work with the British
and Irish governments and the political leaders in
Northern Ireland to achieve full implementation of the
Good Friday Accord. Working through the
International Fund for Ireland and the private sector,
we will help the people seize the opportunities that
peace will bring to attract new investment and bridge
the community divide, create new factories,
workplaces and jobs, and establish new centers of
learning for the twenty-first Century.

Russia and the Newly Independent States (NIS):
There is no historical precedent for the transition
underway in Russia, Ukraine, and other NIS. The
United States has core national interests at stake in
those endeavors and has acted quickly to help
people across the NIS to break the back of the Soviet
regime. But the Soviet system’s collapse created
new challenges. In Russia, for example, rigidity often
gave way to laxness and disorder — too many rules
were replaced by too few. The United States’
strategy of engagement with each of the NIS
recognizes that their transformation will be a long-
term endeavor, with far-reaching implications for
regional and global stability, as well as
disappointments and setbacks along the way.

Russia, Ukraine, and most other NIS are now
electoral democracies, although we will continue to
engage with all these countries to improve their
electoral processes and help strengthen civil society
by working with grassroots organization, independent
media and emerging entrepreneurs. Though the
transition from communism to market democracy is
far from complete, the NIS have largely dismantled
state controls over their economies and liberalized
prices. It is in our national interest to help them build
the laws, institutions and skills needed for a market
democracy, to fight crime and corruption and to

32

 

advance human rights and the rule of law. The
conflict in Chechnya represents a major problem in
Russia’s post-Communist development and
relationship with the international community; the
means Russia is pursuing in Chechnya are
undermining its legitimate objective of upholding its
territorial integrity and protecting citizens from
terrorism and lawlessness.

The United States strategy in Russia and the NIS has
made every American safer. Threat reduction
programs have helped deactivate former Soviet
nuclear warheads and make it far less likely that
sensitive materials, technology, expertise, or
equipment do not fall into the wrong hands. We are
working aggressively to strengthen export controls in
Russia and the other NIS and to stem proliferation of
sensitive missile and nuclear technology to countries
of concern such as Iran. The Administration has
supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
the NIS, including through agreement on an adapted
CFE Treaty, which provides schedules for the
withdrawal of Russian forces from Georgia and
Moldova. The integration of Russia, Ukraine, and
other NIS with the new Europe and the international
community remains a key priority. Despite
disagreements over NATO enlargement and the
Kosovo conflict, Russian troops serve shoulder-to-
shoulder with U.S. and NATO forces in Kosovo and
Bosnia. The United States remains committed to
further development of the NATO-Russia relationship
and the NATO-Ukraine distinctive partnership.

Promoting Prosperity

Europe is a key element in America’s global
commercial engagement. Europe and the United
States produce almost half of all global goods and
services; more than 60% of total U.S. investment
abroad is in Europe; and fourteen million workers on
both sides of the Atlantic earn their livelihoods from
transatlantic commerce. As part of the New
Transatlantic Agenda launched in 1995, the United
States and the EU agreed to take concrete steps to
reduce barriers to trade and investment through
creation of an open New Transatlantic Marketplace and
through Mutual Recognition Agreements in goods that
eliminate redundant testing and certification
requirements. Our governments are also cooperating
closely with the civil society dialogues established
under the New Transatlantic Agenda: the Transatlantic

Business Dialogue, Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue,
Transatlantic Environment Dialogue, and Transatlantic
Labor Dialogue. These people-to-people dialogues
create opportunities for increased communication
focusing on best practices, and can help their
governments identify and reduce barriers to greater
transatlantic interaction. In return, our governments
should be committed to listen, learn, and facilitate.

Building on the New Transatlantic Agenda, the United
States and the EU launched the Transatlantic
Economic Partnership in 1998 to deepen our
economic relations, reinforce our political ties and
reduce trade frictions. The first element of the
initiative is reducing barriers that affect
manufacturing, agriculture and services. In the
manufacturing area we are focusing on standards
and technical barriers that American businesses have
identified as the most significant obstacle to
expanding trade. In the agricultural area we are
focusing on regulatory barriers that have inhibited the
expansion of agriculture trade, particularly in the
biotechnology area. In the area of services we seek
to facilitate trade in specific service sectors, thereby
creating new opportunities for the service industries
that are already so active in the European market.

The second element of the Transatlantic Economic
Partnership is a broader, cooperative approach to
addressing a wide range of trade issues. We will
continue not imposing duties on electronic
transmissions and develop a work program in the
WTO for electronic commerce. We will seek to adopt
common positions and effective strategies for
accelerating compliance with WTO commitments on
intellectual property. We will seek to promote
government procurement opportunities, including
promoting compatibility of electronic procurement
information and government contracting systems. To
promote fair competition, we will seek to enhance the
compatibility of our procedures with potentially
significant reductions in cost for American
companies.

The United States strongly supports the process of
European integration embodied in the EU. We support
EU enlargement, and we are also encouraging bilateral
trade and investment in non-EU countries. We
recognize that EU nations face significant economic
challenges and that periods of economic stagnation
have eroded public support for funding
outward-looking foreign policies and greater
integration. We are working closely with our

 

European partners to expand employment, promote
long-term growth and support the New Transatlantic
Agenda.

By supporting historic market reforms in Central and
Eastern Europe and in the NIS, we help new
democracies take root by avoiding conditions, such
as corruption and poverty, that can weaken
democratic governance and erode the appeal of
democratic values. The United States will continue
helping the NIS economies integrate into international
economic and other institutions and develop healthy
business climates. We will continue to promote
political and economic reform in Russia, working to
create a thriving market economy while guarding
against corruption.

We are working with many NIS countries to promote
their accession to the WTO on commercially fair terms.
Building on successful accession of Kyrgyzstan, Latvia
and Estonia, we have made significant progress on the
accession of Georgia, Albania, Armenia, Croatia,
Lithuania and Moldova. We also have held fruitful
discussions on WTO with Russia and Ukraine. We
will continue to mobilize the international community
to provide assistance to support reform and to help
the Central and Eastern European and NIS countries
stimulate foreign and domestic private investment.
We are also encouraging investment in these
countries, especially by U.S. companies.

We are focusing particular attention on investment in
Caspian energy resources and their export from the
Caucasus region to world markets, thereby expanding
and diversifying world energy supplies and promoting
prosperity in the region. A stable and prosperous
Caucasus and Central Asia will facilitate rapid
development and transport to international markets of
the large Caspian oil and gas resources, with
substantial U.S. commercial participation. Resolution
of regional conflicts such as Nagorno-Karabakh and
Abkhazia is important for creating the stability
necessary for development and transport of Caspian
resources.

On November 18, 1999, President Clinton was
present in Istanbul, Turkey for the signing of the
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline agreement and the
Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline Declaration. We
actively supported the negotiations leading to these
agreements and will continue to be actively engaged
in both pipeline projects. We believe that the Baku-
Thilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the trans-Caspian gas

33

pipeline are commercially viable. The Export-Import
Bank and OPIC stand ready to provide the necessary
financing and insurance on a commercial basis to
help bring these projects to fruition. The trans-
Caspian gas pipeline is planned to begin delivering
gas to Turkey in 2002 and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline is planned to begin delivering oil by 2004.

We support these agreements because they will
achieve several important goals. They will help fulfill
our commitment to the prosperity and independence
of the Caspian states. The agreements will help the
development of their societies into democratic, stable
commonwealths, and will bolster relationships among
the states. Countries on both sides of the Caspian —
Azerbaijan, Turkey, Georgia, Kazakhstan and
Turkmenistan — will be working together, united by a
single vision. Development of Caspian energy
resources will improve our energy security, as well as
that of Turkey and other allies. It will create
commercial opportunities for U.S. companies and
other companies around the world. The Baku-Tbilisi-
Ceyhan pipeline is also the most environmentally
sound approach to transporting oil resources from the
Caspian region to world markets.

Promoting Democracy

Democratic reforms in Central and Eastern Europe
and Eurasia are the best measures to avert conditions
that could foster ethnic violence and regional conflict.
Already, the prospect of joining or rejoining the
Western democratic family has strengthened the forces
of democracy and reform in many countries of the
region. Together with our West European partners
we are helping these nations build civil societies. For
example, the CIVITAS organization has carried out a
joint civic education program in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
and a similar project is planned for Ukraine.
Throughout the region, targeted exchange programs
have familiarized key decision-makers and opinion-
molders with the workings of American democracy.

The independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and
democratic and economic reform of the NIS are
important to American interests. To advance these
goals, we are utilizing our bilateral relationships and our
leadership of international institutions to mobilize
governmental and private resources. But the
circumstances affecting the smaller countries depend

in significant measure on the fate of reform in the

34

 

largest and most powerful—Russia. The United States
will continue to promote Russian reform and
international integration, and to build on the progress
that already has been made. Our economic and
political support for the Russian government depends
on its commitment to internal reform and a responsible
foreign policy.

East Asia and the Pacific

President Clinton's vision of a new Pacific community
links security interests with economic growth and our
commitment to democracy and human rights. We
continue to build on that vision, cementing America’s
role as a stabilizing force in a more integrated Asia
Pacific region.

Enhancing Security

Our military presence has been essential to
maintaining the peace and security that have enabled
most nations in the Asia-Pacific region to build thriving
economies for the benefit of all. To deter aggression
and secure our own interests, we maintain about
100,000 military personnel in the region. The U.S.-
Japan security alliance anchors the U.S. presence in
the Asia-Pacific region. Our continuing security role is
further reinforced by our bilateral treaty alliances with
the Republic of Korea, Australia, Thailand and the
Philippines. We are maintaining healthy relations with
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
and supporting regional dialogue — such as in the
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) — on the full range of
common security challenges.

Japan: The United States and Japan reaffirmed our
bilateral security relationship in the April 1996 Joint
Security Declaration. The alliance remains the
cornerstone for achieving common security
objectives and for maintaining a peaceful and
prosperous environment for the Asia Pacific region as
we enter the twenty-first century. The 1997 revised
Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation
create a solid basis for more effective and credible
U.S.-Japan cooperation in peacetime, in the event of
an armed attack on Japan, and in situations in areas
surrounding Japan. They provide a general
framework and policy direction for the roles and
missions of the two countries, and ways of
coordinating our efforts in peacetime and

contingencies. The revised Guidelines, like the U.S.-
Japan security relationship itself, are not directed
against any other country; rather, they enable the
U.S.-Japan alliance to continue fostering peace and
security throughout the region. In April 1998, in order
to support the new Guidelines, both governments
agreed to a revised Acquisition and Cross-Servicing
Agreement (ACSA) which expands the provision of
supplies and services to include reciprocal provision
of logistics support during situations surrounding
Japan that have an important influence on Japan’s
peace and security. Japan approved implementing
legislation for the Guidelines in the spring of 1999.
Japan’s generous host nation support for the U.S.
overseas presence also serves as a critical strategic
contribution to the alliance and to regional security.

Our bilateral security cooperation has broadened as
a result of recent agreements to undertake joint
research and development on theater missile
defense and to cooperate on Japan’s indigenous
satellite program. Moreover, we work closely with
Japan to promote regional peace and stability, seek
universal adherence to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, and address the dangers posed by transfers
of destabilizing conventional arms and sensitive dual-
use technologies. Japan is providing $1 billion to the
Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization
(KEDO), and consults closely with the United States
and ROK on issues relating to North Korea.

Korean Peninsula: Tensions on the Korean
Peninsula remain the leading threat to peace and
stability in East Asia. The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) has publicly stated a
preference for peaceful reunification, but continues to
dedicate a large portion of its dwindling resources to
its huge military forces. Renewed conflict has been
prevented since 1953 by a combination of the
Armistice Agreement, which brought an end to open
hostilities; the United Nations Command, which has
visibly represented the will of the UN Security Council
to secure peace; and the physical presence of U.S.
and ROK troops in the Combined Forces Command,
which has demonstrated the alliance’s resolve.

President Kim Dae-jung continues to pursue a course
toward peace and stability on the Korean peninsula,
seeking new channels of dialogue with North Korea
and developing areas of cooperation between South
and North. During their July 1999 meeting in
Washington, President Clinton and President Kim
reaffirmed the need for direct dialogue between

 

South and North to build a more permanent peace,
and the indispensability of the strong U.S.-ROK
defense alliance as a stabilizing pillar for the region.
President Clinton strongly restated his support for
President Kim’s vision of engagement and efforts
toward reconciliation with the North. The United
States is working to create conditions of stability by
maintaining solidarity with our South Korean ally,
emphasizing America’s commitment to shaping a
peaceful and prosperous Korean Peninsula, and
ensuring that an isolated and struggling North Korea
does not opt for a military solution to its political and
economic problems.

Peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict with a
democratic, non-nuclear, reunified peninsula will
enhance peace and security in the East Asian region
and is clearly in our strategic interest. We are willing to
improve bilateral political and economic ties with North
Korea — consistent with the objectives of our alliance
with the ROK —to draw the North into more normal
relations with the region and the rest of the world. But
our willingness to improve bilateral relations will
continue to be commensurate with the North’s
cooperation in efforts to reduce tensions on the
peninsula.

South Korea has set an example for nonproliferation
by forswearing nuclear weapons, accepting IAEA
safeguards, and developing a peaceful nuclear
program that brings benefits to the region. We are
firm that North Korea must maintain the freeze on
production and reprocessing of fissile material,
dismantle its graphite-moderated reactors and related
facilities, and fully comply with its NPT obligations
under the Agreed Framework. The United States, too,
must fulfill its obligations under the Agreed Framework
and the Administration will work with the Congress to
ensure the success of our efforts to address the North
Korean nuclear threat.

Beyond fully implementing the Agreed Framework, we
seek to eliminate North Korea’s development and
export of long-range missiles and weapons of mass
destruction through a step-by-step process. Based on
U.S.-North Korean discussions in September 1999, it is
our understanding that North Korea will continue to
refrain from testing long-range missiles of any kind as
we move toward more normal relations. Working
closely with our ROK and Japanese allies, we will
improve relations with North Korea on the basis of their
moving forward on the missile and WMD agendas, and

35

we will take necessary measures in the other direction
if the North chooses to go down a different path.

The North also needs to engage in a productive
dialogue with South Korea; continue the United Nations
Command-Korean People's Army General Officer
Dialogue at Panmunjom; participate constructively in
the Four Party Talks among the United States, China,
and North and South Korea to reduce tensions and
negotiate a peace agreement; and support our efforts
to recover the remains of American servicemen
missing since the Korean War.

China: A stable, open, prosperous People's
Republic of China (PRC) that respects international
norms and assumes its responsibilities for building a
more peaceful world is clearly and profoundly in our
interests. The prospects for peace and prosperity in
Asia depend heavily on China’s role as a responsible
member of the international community. Our policy
toward China is both principled and pragmatic,
expanding our areas of cooperation while dealing
forthrightly with our differences. Despite strains in the
relationship resulting from the tragic accidental
bombing of the PRC embassy in Belgrade, we have
continued to engage China on these issues.

The United States and China have taken a number of
additional steps to strengthen cooperation in
international affairs: presidential visits to each other's
capitals; establishing the Vice President-Premier
Forum on environment and development; regular
exchanges of visits by cabinet and sub-cabinet
officials to consult on political, military, security, arms
control and human rights issues; establishing a
consultation mechanism to strengthen military
maritime safety; holding discussions on humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief, and environmental
security; and establishing working groups on law
enforcement cooperation. China is also a major
partner in science, technology and health research.

U.S. interests have been advanced in discussions
with China on arms control and nonproliferation
issues. In 1998, the United States and China
announced that they will not target their strategic
nuclear weapons at each other and confirmed their
common goal of halting the spread of WMD. Both
our nations have signed the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty. We have consulted on the Missile
Technology Control Regime and missile
nonproliferation, and we continue to press China to
avoid destabilizing missile technology sales to other

36

 

countries. Both our nations have signed the
Chemical Weapons Convention, and we have agreed
to further strengthen controls on the export of dual-
use chemicals and related production equipment and
technology to assure they are not used for production
of chemical weapons. China also has expanded the
list of chemical precursors that it controls. Both
nations have called for strengthening of the Biological
Weapons Convention and early conclusion of a
protocol establishing a practical and effective
mechanism to enhance compliance and improve
transparency. We also reached agreement with
China on practices for end-use visits on U.S. high
technology exports to China and continue a dialogue
on implementation of this agreement.

China is working with the United States on important
regional security issues. In South Asia, China has
condemned India and Pakistan for conducting
nuclear tests and joined us in urging them to conduct
no more tests, to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, to avoid deploying or testing missiles, and to
work to resolve their differences through dialogue.
On the Korean Peninsula, the United States and
China share an interest in peace and stability. We
have both worked to convince North Korea to freeze
its dangerous nuclear program, and believe the four-
party peace talks are an important tool in working
toward establishment of peace and stability in
Northeast Asia. To help maintain peace, security, and
stability in the Western Pacific and to promote our
broad foreign policy objectives we are implementing
fully the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act by
maintaining robust unofficial relations between the
American people and the people of Taiwan.

Our key security objectives for the future include:
sustaining the strategic dialogue begun by the recent
summits and other high-level exchanges; enhancing
stability in the Taiwan Strait through maintenance of
our “one China” policy, peaceful resolution of cross-
Strait issues and encouraging dialogue between
Beijing and Taipei; strengthening China's adherence
to international nonproliferation norms, particularly in
export controls on ballistic missile and dual-use
technologies; restarting our bilateral discussions on
arms control ; achieving greater openness and
transparency in China's military; encouraging a
constructive PRC role in international affairs through
active cooperation in multilateral fora such as the
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC); and

improving law enforcement cooperation in such areas
as counterterrorism and counternarcotics.

Southeast Asia: Our strategic interest in Southeast
Asia centers on developing regional and bilateral
security and economic relationships that assist in
conflict prevention and resolution and expand U.S.
participation in the region’s economies. U.S. security
objectives in the region are: to maintain our security
alliances with Australia, Thailand and the Philippines;
to sustain security access arrangements with
Singapore and other ASEAN countries; and to
encourage the emergence of a strong, cohesive
ASEAN capable of enhancing regional security and
prosperity. The Philippine Senate’s ratification of the
Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) in May 1999 is one
example of how our continuing engagement
enhances both bilateral defense cooperation as well
as regional security interests.

Our policy combines two approaches. First, we must
maintain our increasingly productive relationship with
ASEAN and enhancing our security dialogue under
the ARF. Second, we must pursue bilateral initiatives
with individual Southeast Asian nations to promote
democracy, human rights and political stability; foster
market-oriented economic reforms; and reduce the
effects of organized crime, particularly the flow of
heroin from Burma and other countries in the region.

In 1999, the United States, in partnership with the
member nations of ASEAN, opened the International
Law Enforcement Academy in Bangkok, Thailand.
Officials of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, U.S. Customs Service, FBI and other
agencies provide high-caliber training in areas such
as drug trafficking, alien smuggling, cyber crime, and
other transnational threats. The International Law
Enforcement Academy also promotes cooperation
and information sharing, as well as significantly
improving regional counterdrug capabilities.

Promoting Prosperity

A prosperous and open Asia Pacific is key to the
economic health of the United States. On the eve of
the recent financial problems in Asia, the 21
members of APEC — which includes the United
States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile and Russia,
along with East Asian nations — contributed about
one-half of total global gross domestic product and

 

exports. Thirty percent of U.S. exports go to Asia,
supporting millions of U.S. jobs, and we export more
to Asia than Europe. Our economic objectives in
East Asia include: continued recovery from the recent
financial crisis; further progress within APEC toward
liberalizing trade and investment; increased U.S.
exports to Asian countries through market-opening
measures and leveling the playing field for U.S.
business; and WTO accession for the PRC and
Taiwan on satisfactory commercial terms.
Opportunities for economic growth abound in Asia
and underlie our strong commitment to economic
cooperation, such as via the annual APEC leaders
meetings.

Our economic strategy in Asia has four key elements:
support for economic reforms and market opening;
working with international financial institutions to
provide well-targeted economic and technical
assistance in support of economic reforms; providing
bilateral humanitarian aid and contingency bilateral
financial assistance if needed; and urging strong
policy actions by Japan and the other major
economic powers to promote global growth.

The United States will continue to work with the IMF,
the World Bank, other international financial
institutions, the governments in East Asia and the
private sector to help stabilize financial markets,
restore investor confidence and deepen on-going
reforms in the troubled East Asian economies. In
doing so, we will remain mindful of the need to
promote protection of worker rights. We will continue
to support South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia as
they implement economic reforms designed to foster
financial stability and investor confidence in order to
attract the capital flows required to restore economic
growth. U.S. initiatives in APEC will open new
opportunities for economic cooperation and permit U.S.
companies to expand their involvement in substantial
infrastructure planning and construction throughout the
region. We will continue our efforts to encourage all
Asia Pacific nations to pursue open markets.

China: Bringing the PRC more fully into the global
trading system is manifestly in our national interest.
China is a major potential market for our goods and
services. As we look into the next century, our
exports to China will support hundreds of thousands
of jobs across our country. For this reason, we must
continue our normal trade relationship with China, as
every President has done since 1980, to strengthen
our economic relationship.

37

An important part of integrating China into the market-
based world economic system is opening China’s
highly protected market through elimination of trade
barriers and removal of distorting restraints on
economic activity. We have negotiated and vigorously
enforced landmark agreements to combat piracy of
intellectual property and advance the interests of our
creative industries. We have also negotiated — and
vigorously enforced — agreements on textile trade. We
will continue to press China to open its markets as it
engages in sweeping economic reform and to respect
and adhere to core labor standards as codified by the
ILO. Most recently, we reached agreement to bring
China into the World Trade Organization on fair
commercial terms — a landmark accord that will
create jobs and opportunities for Americans through
opening of Chinese markets, promote economic
reform in China, and help spread the message and
the tools of freedom to the Chinese people.

Japan: The Administration continues to make
progress on increasing market access in Asia’s
largest economy. Since the beginning of the first
Clinton Administration, the United States and Japan
have reached 38 trade agreements designed to open
Japanese markets in key sectors, including autos and
auto parts, telecommunications, civil aviation,
insurance and glass. The Administration also has
intensified efforts to monitor and enforce trade
agreements with Japan to ensure that they are fully
implemented. The United States also uses
multilateral venues, such as WTO dispute settlement
and negotiation of new multilateral agreements, to
further open markets and accomplish our trade
objectives with Japan. The US-Japan Common
Agenda advances our bilateral cooperation with a
major donor ally on global and regional
environmental, scientific, and health issues.

Japan has a crucial role to play in Asia’s economic
recovery: generating substantial growth to help
maintain a growing world economy and absorb a
growing share of imports from emerging markets.
We have encouraged Japan to reform its financial
sector, stimulate domestic demand, deregulate its
economy, and further open its markets to foreign
goods and services.

Republic of Korea: The United States will continue
its strong support for South Korean efforts to reform
its economy, liberalize trade and investment,
strengthen the banking system and implement the

38

 

IMF program. We have committed to providing
bilateral finance under appropriate conditions and will
continue to explore concrete steps to promote growth
in both our countries, to more fully open our markets,
and to further integrate the Republic of Korea into the
global economy.

ASEAN: The United States strongly supports efforts
to sustain and strengthen economic recovery in the
ten nations of ASEAN through maintaining our open
market for Southeast Asian goods and services, as
well as our support for IMF-led recovery programs for
several ASEAN nations. Thailand has completed its
IMF-mandated structural reform program and has
turned the corner towards renewed growth.
Indonesia's economy has basically stabilized and the
newly elected democratic government is working on
new lending agreements with the IMF and World
Bank, linked to progress on economic and financial
reform. We applaud ASEAN’s 1998 Hanoi Action
Plan, which calls for accelerated regional economic
integration. We are working toward completion of a
broad commercial agreement with Vietnam that will
open markets and promote economic reform while
allowing us to endorse Normal Trade Relations for
Vietnam, which we also seek for Laos. Working with
ASEAN members to address environmental
degradation in Southeast Asia is a major priority,
from forest fires and haze, to fisheries depletion,
deforestation, and sustainable growth during the
recovery from the Asian financial crisis.

Australia and New Zealand: We are building on our
already close working relationship with Australia and
New Zealand to strengthen our bilateral trade and
economic relationships, build consensus for regional
liberalization, and cooperate in opening the new
round of international trade negotiations at the WTO.

Promoting Democracy

We will continue to support the democratic
aspirations of Asians and to promote respect for
human rights. Our strategy includes: a constructive
approach toward achieving progress on human
rights, religious freedom and rule of law issues with
China; fostering meaningful political dialogue
between the ruling authorities in Burma and the
democratic opposition; promoting democracy and
encouraging greater respect for human rights in
Cambodia; and, in Vietnam, achieving the fullest

possible accounting of missing U.S. service members
and promoting greater respect for human rights.

Indonesia: The October 1999 election in which
Abdurrahman Wahid was elected President and
Megawati Sukarnoputri as Vice President was a
historic moment for Indonesia, putting it on course
toward becoming the world’s third largest democracy.
The United States strongly supports a united,
prosperous and democratic Indonesia that plays a
positive role in regional security. We look forward to
working with Indonesia’s new leaders to meet the
challenges of national reconciliation, democratic
reform and economic recovery that lie ahead.

The referendum in East Timor on August 30, 1999
was conducted fairly by the United Nations with the
agreement of the Indonesian Government. It
produced a clear mandate for independence, but
armed groups opposed to independence attempted
to overturn the results through violence. To stop the
violence, restore order and resume the transition
process, the UN Security Council unanimously
approved creation of a Multi-National Force
(INTERFET) led by Australia. INTERFET
accomplished its mission of establishing secure
conditions throughout East Timor and an international
peacekeeping force under UN command (UNTAET)
will take over in early 2000.

The U.S. contribution to INTERFET is relatively
small, but performs highly important functions,
including communications and logistical aid,
intelligence, and airlift of personnel, equipment and
humanitarian materiel. Additionally, elements of the
U.S. Pacific Fleet have been providing support for the
operation. This mission supports our interests by
helping to restore stability to a region of strategic
importance to the United States.

East Timor is now under a UN-administered transition
authority (UNTAET) and in two to three years will
gain full independence. A UNTAET peacekeeping
force will replace INTERFET to prevent further
instability and violence as East Timor becomes an
independent nation.

The Western Hemisphere

Our hemisphere enters the twenty-first century with an
unprecedented opportunity to secure a future of

 

stability and prosperity — building on the fact that every
nation in the hemisphere except Cuba is democratic
and committed to free market economies. The end of
armed conflict in Central America and other
improvements in regional security have coincided with
remarkable political and economic progress throughout
the Americas. The people of the Americas are taking
advantage of the vast opportunities being created as
emerging markets are connected through electronic
commerce and as robust democracies allow individuals
to more fully express their preferences. Sub-regional
political, economic and security cooperation in North
America, the Caribbean, Central America, the Andean
region and the Southern Cone have contributed
positively to peace and prosperity throughout the
hemisphere. Equally important, the people of the
Americas have reaffirmed their commitment to combat
together the difficult threats posed by drug trafficking
and corruption. The United States seeks to secure the
benefits of this new climate in the hemisphere, while
safeguarding our citizens against these threats.

Enhancing Security

The principal security concerns in the hemisphere are
transnational in nature, such as drug trafficking,
organized crime, money laundering, illegal
immigration, firearms trafficking, and terrorism. In
addition, our hemisphere is leading the way in
recognizing the dangers to national and regional
stability produced by corruption and ineffective legal
systems. All of these threats, especially drug
trafficking, produce adverse social effects that
undermine the sovereignty, democracy and national
security of nations in the hemisphere.

Working through the Organization of American States
(OAS) and other organizations, we are seeking to
eliminate the scourge of drug trafficking in our
hemisphere. The Multilateral Counterdrug Alliance is
striving to better organize and coordinate efforts to
extradite and prosecute individuals charged with drug
trafficking and related crimes; combat money
laundering; seize assets used in criminal activity; halt
illicit traffic in chemical precursors; strike at the
financial support networks; enhance national drug
abuse awareness and treatment programs; and
eliminate illicit crops through alternative development
and eradication programs. We are also pursuing a
number of bilateral and regional counterdrug initiatives.
In the Caribbean, and bilaterally with Mexico and

39

Colombia, we are working to increase counterdrug and
law enforcement cooperation.

We are advancing regional security cooperation
through: bilateral security dialogues; multilateral efforts
in the OAS and Summit of the Americas on
transparency and regional confidence and security
building measures, exercises and exchanges with key
militaries (principally focused on peacekeeping); and
regular Defense Ministerials. Last year, the guarantor
nations of the Peru-Ecuador peace process —
Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States —
brought the parties to a permanent solution to this
decades-old border dispute, the resolution of which
was important to regional stability. The Military
Observer Mission, Ecuador-Peru (MOMEP),
composed of the four guarantor nations, successfully
separated the warring factions, creating the mutual
confidence and security necessary to resolve the
dispute. Our efforts to encourage multilateral
cooperation are enhancing confidence and security
within the region and will help expand our
cooperative efforts to combat the transnational
threats to the Western Hemisphere.

Colombia is of particular importance because its
problems extend beyond its borders and have
implications for regional peace and security.
Insurgency, drug trafficking and a growing
paramilitary movement are testing democracy in
Colombia. To turn the tide, President Pastrana
needs U.S. assistance to wage a comprehensive
effort to promote the mutually reinforcing goals of
peace, combating drug trafficking, economic
development, and respect for human rights.
Working closely with us, the Government of Colombia
has developed an aggressive three-year strategy,
Plan Colombia, to revive their economy, strengthen
the democratic pillars of society, promote the peace
process and eliminate sanctuaries for narcotics
producers and traffickers. We will significantly
increase assistance for Plan Colombia in a manner
that will concurrently promote U.S. and Colombian
interests, and we will encourage our allies and
international institutions to do the same.

Promoting Prosperity

Economic growth and integration in the Americas will
profoundly affect the prosperity of the United States
in the twenty-first century. This begins with our
immediate neighbors, Canada and Mexico. Canada is

40

 

our largest merchandise export market and trade
partner in the world, and our exports to Canada have
grown rapidly as the U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement phased in. U.S. merchandise exports to
Mexico have nearly doubled since the conclusion of the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
making Mexico our second largest goods export
market and trading partner. In the hemisphere as a
whole, our trade initiatives offer a historic opportunity to
capitalize on and strengthen the unprecedented trend
toward democracy and free market economics.

We seek to advance the goal of an integrated
hemisphere of free market democracies by building
on NAFTA and obtaining Congressional Fast Track
trade agreement approval procedures. Formal
negotiations are in progress to initiate the Free Trade
Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005. The
negotiations cover a broad range of important issues,
including market access, investment, services,
government procurement, dispute settlement,
agriculture, intellectual property rights, competition
policy, subsidies, anti-dumping and countervailing
duties. We will seek to ensure that the agreement
also supports workers rights, environmental
protection and sustainable development. We are also
committed to delivering on the President's promise to
pursue a comprehensive free trade agreement with
Chile because of its economic performance and its
active role in promoting hemispheric economic
integration. To address the concerns of smaller
economies during the period of transition to the
global economy of the twenty-first century, and in
light of the increased competition NAFTA presents to
Caribbean trade, we are seeking Congressional
approval to provide enhanced trade benefits under
the Caribbean Basin Initiative to help prepare that
region for participation in the FTAA.

The United States will continue its effective
partnership with the IMF, the World Bank, the Inter-
American Development Bank, the governments of
Latin America, and the private sector to help the
region’s countries in their transition to integrated,
mature market economies. A key target of this
partnership is assisting the reform and recovery of
banking sectors hurt by financial market turmoil over
the past several years. We will continue to support
financial and economic reform efforts in Brazil and
Argentina to reduce their vulnerability to external
shocks, as well as helping Ecuador on its difficult
road to economic recovery and sustainable levels of
debt service.

We also view it as essential that economic prosperity
in our hemisphere be pursued in an environmentally
sustainable manner. From our shared seas and
freshwater resources to migratory bird species and
transboundary air pollution, the environmental
policies of our neighbors can have a direct impact on
quality of life at home. U.S. Government assistance
to the region recognizes the vital link between
sustainable use of natural resources and long-term
prosperity, a key to developing prosperous trading
partners in this hemisphere.

Promoting Democracy

Many Latin American nations have made tremendous
advances in democracy and economic progress over
the last several years. But our ability to sustain the
hemispheric agenda crafted at the Summit of the
Americas depends in part on meeting the challenges
posed by weak democratic institutions, persistently
high unemployment and crime rates, and serious
income disparities. In some Latin American
countries, citizens will not fully realize the benefits of
political liberalization and economic growth without
regulatory, judicial, law enforcement and educational
reforms, as well as increased efforts to integrate all
members of society into the formal economy.

The hemisphere's leaders are committed to
strengthening democracy, justice and human rights.
They have pledged to intensify efforts to promote
democratic reforms at the regional and local level,
protect the rights of migrant workers and their
families, improve the capabilities and competence of
civil and criminal justice systems, and encourage a
strong and active civil society. Specific initiatives
include: ratification of the Inter-American Convention
Against Corruption to strengthen the integrity of
governmental institutions; creation of a Special
Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression as part of the
Inter-American Commission for Human Rights; and
establishment of an Inter-American Justice Studies
Center to facilitate training of personnel and the
exchange of information and other forms of technical
cooperation to improve judicial systems.

Education is at the centerpiece of reforms aimed at
making democracy work for all the people of the
Americas. The Summit Action Plan adopted at
Santiago in 1998 seeks to ensure by the year 2010
primary education for 100% of children and access to

 

quality secondary education for at least 75% of young
people.

We are also seeking to strengthen norms for defense
establishments that are supportive of democracy,
transparency, respect for human rights and civilian
control in defense matters. Through continued
engagement with regional armed forces, facilitated by
our own modest military activities and presence in the
region, we are helping to increase civilian expertise in
defense affairs and reinforce the positive trend in
civilian control.

In Haiti we continue to support the consolidation of
democratic institutions, respect for human rights and
economic growth by a Haitian government capable of
managing its own security. In cooperation with the
United Nations and Organization of American States,
we are working with Haiti's Provisional Electoral
Council to pave the way for free, fair, and transparent
local, legislative and presidential elections in 2000.
We are committed to working with our partners in the
region and in the international community to meet the
challenges of institutionalizing Haiti's economic and
political development, and building an effective and fair
police force and judicial system.

The United States remains committed to promoting a
peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba and
forestalling a mass exodus that would endanger the
lives of migrants and the security of our borders. While
maintaining pressure on the regime to make political
and economic reforms, we continue to encourage the
emergence of a civil society to assist the transition to
democracy when the change comes. As the Cuban
people feel greater incentive to take charge of their
own future, they are more likely to stay at home and
build the informal and formal structures that will make
transition easier. Meanwhile, we remain firmly
committed to bilateral migration accords that ensure
migration in safe, legal and orderly channels.

The Middle East, North
Africa, Southwest and
South Asia

Developments in these regions will profoundly affect
America’s future. They will determine whether a just
and lasting peace can be established between Israel

41

and the Arab countries; whether nations of the region
will fully join our fight against terrorism and drug
trafficking; whether they will agree to stop the spread of
weapons of mass destruction; whether the oil and gas
fields of the Caucasus and Central Asia become
reliable energy sources; and whether respect for basic
human rights and democracy can be institutionalized.

Enhancing Security

The United States has enduring interests in pursuing a
just, lasting and comprehensive Middle East peace,
ensuring the security and well-being of Israel, helping
our Arab friends provide for their security, and
maintaining the free flow of oil. Our strategy reflects
those interests and the unique characteristics of the
region as we work to strengthen peace and stability.

The Middle East Peace Process

A historic transformation is taking place in the political
landscape of the Middle East. Peace agreements are
taking hold, requiring concerted implementation efforts,
and new agreements are being negotiated, which hold
out the hope of ending the conflict between Israel and
its Arab neighbors. The United States - a key architect
and sponsor of the peace process - has a clear
national interest in seeing the process deepen and
widen. We will continue our steady, determined
leadership - standing with those who take risks for
peace, standing against those who would destroy it,
lending our good offices where we can make a
difference and helping bring the concrete benefits of
peace to people's daily lives.

A significant breakthrough in the Middle East Peace
Process took place in December 1999 when Prime
Minister Barak and President Assad agreed to
resume the Israel-Syrian peace negotiations where
they left off. These negotiations will be high level,
intensive, and conducted with the aim of reaching an
agreement as soon as possible in order to bring a
just and lasting peace between Israel and Syria.
With the resumption of Israeli-Syrian talks, we will
continue working to begin negotiations between
Israel and Lebanon.

On the Palestinian front, Israelis and Palestinians are

turning to the core issues that have defined their
conflict for the past fifty years, seeking to build a lasting

42

 

peace based on partnership and cooperation. They
have agreed to seek to reach a permanent status
agreement by September 2000 and the United States
will do everything within its power to help them achieve
that goal. At the same time, both sides will continue to
implement the remaining issues in the Interim
Agreement, the Wye River Memorandum, and the
Sharm el-Sheikh agreement. Our goal remains the
normalization of relations between Israel and all Arab
states. Through the multilateral working groups on
security, refugees, water and the environment, we are
seeking to promote regional cooperation to address
transboundary environmental issues that affect all
parties.

North Africa

The United States has an interest in the stability and
prosperity of North Africa, a region that is undergoing
important changes. In particular, we are seeking to
strengthen our relations with Morocco, Tunisia and
Algeria and to encourage political and economic
reform. Libya continues to be a country of concern
for the national security and foreign policy interests of
the United States. Although the government of Libya
has taken an important positive step away from its
support of terrorism by surrendering the Lockerbie
suspects, our policy toward Libya is designed to
encourage Libya to completely cease its support of
terrorism and block its efforts to obtain weapons of
mass destruction.

Southwest Asia

In Southwest Asia, the United States remains
focused on deterring threats to regional stability and
energy security, countering threats posed by WMD,
and protecting the security of our regional partners,
particularly from the threats posed by Iraq and Iran.
We will continue to encourage members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) to work closely on
collective defense and security arrangements, help
individual GCC states meet their defense requirements,
and maintain our bilateral defense relationships.

We will maintain an appropriate military presence in
Southwest Asia using a combination of ground, air
and naval forces. We maintain a continuous military
presence in the Gulf to enhance regional stability and
support our on-going efforts to bring Iraq into

compliance with UN Security Council resolutions.
Our forces in the Gulf are backed by our ability to
rapidly reinforce the region in time of crisis, which we
have demonstrated convincingly. We remain
committed to enforcing the no-fly zones over northern
and southern Iraq, which are essential for
implementing the UN Security Council resolutions
and preventing Saddam Hussein from taking large-
scale military action against Kuwait or the Kurd and
Shia minorities in Iraq.

Our policy toward Iraq is comprised of three central
elements: containment and economic sanctions, to
prevent Saddam from again threatening the stability
of the vital Gulf region; relief for the Iraqi people from
humanitarian suffering via the UN oil-for-food
program; and support to those Iraqis seeking to
replace Saddam's regime with a government that can
live at peace with its neighbors and its people.
Operation Desert Fox in December 1998 successfully
degraded the threat posed by Iraqi WMD in the wake
of Baghdad's decision to cease cooperation with UN
weapons inspectors.

In December 1999, the United Nations Security
Council passed UNSCR 1284, a new omnibus
resolution on Iraq. The United States supports
Resolution 1284 because it buttresses the
containment of Iraq. This resolution reflects the
consensus view of the Security Council that Iraq has
still not met its obligations to the international
community and, in particular, has failed to disband
fully its proscribed WMD programs. The resolution
expands the humanitarian aspects of the oil-for-food
program to ensure the well-being of the Iraqi people.
It provides for a robust new disarmament program
that would finish the work begun by UNSCOM. It
would allow for a suspension of the economic
sanctions in return for Iraqi fulfillment of key
disarmament tasks, and would lock in the Security
Council’s control over Iraqi finances to ensure that
Saddam Hussein is never again able to disburse
lraq’s resources as he would like.

We have consistently maintained that the Iraqi
regime can only have sanctions lifted when it has met
its obligations to the international community.
Saddam’s actions over the past decade make clear
that his regime will not comply with its obligations
under the UN Security Council resolutions designed
to rid Iraq of WMD and their delivery systems.
Because of that and because the Iraqi people will

 

never be free under the brutal dictatorship of Saddam
Hussein, we actively support those who seek to bring
a new democratic government to power in Baghdad.
We recognize that this may be a slow and difficult
process, but we believe it is the only solution to the
problem of Saddam's regime.

Our policy toward Iran is aimed at changing the
practices of the Iranian government in several key
areas, including its efforts to obtain WMD and long-
range missiles, its support for terrorism and groups
that violently oppose the Middle East peace process,
its attempts to undermine friendly governments in the
region, and its development of offensive military
capabilities that threaten our GCC partners and the
flow of oil. We view signs of change in Iranian
policies with interest, both with regard to the
possibility of Iran assuming its rightful place in the
world community and the chance for better bilateral
ties. We welcome statements by President Khatemi
that advocate a people-to-people dialogue with the
United States.

These positive signs must be balanced against the
reality that Iran's support for terrorism has not yet
ceased and serious violations of human rights
persist. Iran is continuing its efforts to acquire WMD
and develop long range missiles (including the 1,300
kilometer-range Shahab-3 it flight-tested in July
1998). The United States will continue to oppose
Iranian efforts to sponsor terror and to oppose
transfers from any country to Iran of materials and
technologies that could be used to develop long-
range missiles or WMD.

We are ready to explore further ways to build mutual
confidence and avoid misunderstandings with Iran.
We will strengthen our cooperation with allies and
friends to encourage positive changes in Iranian
practices that threaten our shared interests. Ifa
government-to-government dialogue can be initiated
and sustained in a way that addresses the concerns
of both sides, then the United States would be willing
to develop with the Islamic Republic a road map
leading to normal relations.

South Asia

Our strategy for South Asia is designed to help the
peoples of that region enjoy the fruits of democracy by
helping resolve long-standing conflicts, implementing

43

confidence-building measures, and assisting economic
development. Regional stability and improved bilateral
ties are also important for U.S. economic interests in a
region that contains a fifth of the world’s population and
one of its most important emerging markets. In
addition, we seek to work closely with regional
countries to stem the flow of illegal drugs from South
Asia, most notably from Afghanistan. We seek to
establish relationships with India and Pakistan that are
defined in terms of their own individual merits and
reflect the full weight and range of U.S. strategic,
political and economic interests in each country. The
October 1999 coup in Pakistan was a clear setback for
democracy in that region, and we have urged
Pakistan’s leaders to quickly restore civilian rule and
the democratic process.

We seek, as part of our dialogue with India and
Pakistan, to encourage both countries to take steps to
prevent proliferation, reduce the risk of conflict, and

exercise restraint in their nuclear and missile programs.

The Indian and Pakistani nuclear and long-range
missile tests were dangerously destabilizing and
threaten to spark a dangerous arms race in South
Asia. Recent fighting along the Line of Control is a
reminder of the tensions in that part of the world and
of the risk that relatively minor conventional
confrontations could spin out of control, with the most
serious consequences.

In concert with the other permanent members of the
UN Security Council, the G-8 nations, and many
others in the international community, the United
States has called on both nations to sign and ratify
the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, to take
steps to prevent an arms race in nuclear weapons
and long-range missiles, to resume their direct
dialogue, and take decisive steps to reduce tensions
in South Asia. We also strongly urge these states to
refrain from any actions that would further undermine
regional and global stability, and urge them to join the
clear international consensus in support of
nonproliferation and a cut off of fissile material
production.

Promoting Prosperity

The United States has two principal economic
objectives in the region: to promote regional economic
cooperation and development and to ensure an
unrestricted flow of oil from the region. We seek to

44

 

promote regional trade and cooperation on
infrastructure through the peace process, revitalization
of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic
summits, and our Qualifying Industrial Zone program,
which provides economic benefits for certain countries
that enter into business arrangements with Israel. In
South Asia, we will continue to work with the region’s
democracies in their efforts to implement market
reforms, strengthen educational systems, and end the
use of child and sweatshop labor.

Although the United States imports less than 15% of
the oil exported from the Persian Gulf, the region will
remain of vital strategic importance to U.S. national
security due to the global nature of the international oil
market. Previous oil shocks and the Gulf War
underscore that any blockage of Gulf supplies or a
substantial increase in price would immediately affect
the international market, driving up energy costs
everywhere -- ultimately harming the U.S. economy as
well as the economies of our key economic partners in
Europe and Japan. Appropriate responses to events
such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait can limit the
magnitude of a crisis in the Gulf and its impact on world
oil markets. Over the longer term, U.S. dependence
on access to these and other foreign oil sources will
remain important as our reserves are depleted. That is
one of many important reasons why the United States
must continue to demonstrate commitment and resolve
in the Persian Gulf.

Promoting Democracy

We encourage the spread of democratic values
throughout the Middle East, North Africa and
Southwest and South Asia and will pursue this
objective aided by constructive dialogue with
countries in the region. In Iran, for example, we hope
the nation's leaders will carry out the people's
mandate for a government that respects and protects
the rule of law, both in its internal and external affairs.
We will promote responsible indigenous moves
toward increasing political participation and
enhancing the quality of governance, and we will
continue to challenge governments in the region to
improve their human rights records. Respect for
human rights also requires rejection of terrorism. If
the nations in the region are to safeguard their own
citizens from the threat of terror, they cannot tolerate
acts of indiscriminate violence against civilians, nor
can they offer refuge to those who commit such acts.

Our policies are guided by our profound respect for
Islam. The Muslim religion is the fastest-growing
faith in the United States. We recognize and honor
Islam's role as a source of inspiration, instruction and
moral guidance for hundreds of millions of people
around the world. U.S. policy in the region is directed
at the actions of governments and terrorist groups,
not peoples or faiths.

Sub-Saharan Africa

In recent years, the United States has engaged ina
concerted effort to transform our relationship with
Africa. We have supported efforts by many African
nations to move toward multi-party democracy, hold
free and fair elections, promote human rights, allow
freedom of the press and association, and reform
their economies. A new, post-colonial political order
is emerging in Africa, with emphasis on democratic
and pragmatic approaches to solving political,
economic and environmental problems, and
developing human and natural resources. U.S.-
Africa ties are deepening, and U.S.-Africa trade is
expanding.

Sustaining these recent successes will require that
we identify those issues that most directly affect our
interests, and on which we can make a difference
through efficient and effective targeting of our
resources. We will promote regional stability through
engagement with sub-regional organizations and key
African states using carefully harmonized U.S.
programs and initiatives. Our immediate objective is
to increase the number of capable states in Africa;
that is, nations that are able to define the challenges
they face, manage their resources to effectively
address those challenges, and build stability and
peace within their borders and their sub-regions.

Enhancing Security

Serious transnational security threats emanate from
pockets of Africa, including state-sponsored
terrorism, drug trafficking, international crime,
environmental degradation and infectious diseases,
especially HIV/AIDS. Since these threats transcend
state borders, they are best addressed through
effective, sustained sub-regional engagement in
Africa. We have already made significant progress in

 

countering some of these threats — such as by
investing in efforts to combat environmental
degradation and infectious disease, and leading
international efforts to remove mines planted in
previous conflict areas and halt the proliferation of
land mines. We continue efforts to reduce the flow of
illegal drugs through Africa and to curtail international
organized criminal activity based in Africa. We will
improve international intelligence sharing, and train
and assist African law enforcement, intelligence and
border control agencies to detect and prevent
planned terrorist attacks against U.S. targets in
Africa.

We seek to keep Africa free of weapons of mass
destruction by supporting South Africa's nuclear
disarmament and accession to the NPT as a non-
nuclear weapon state, supporting the African Nuclear
Weapons Free Zone, and encouraging African
nations to join the BWC and CWC.

Nigeria’s rapid change from an autocratic, military
regime to a civilian, democratically elected
government affords us an opportunity to build
productive security, political and economic relations
with the most populous country in Africa. With nearly
one in six Africans living in Nigeria, the impact of
serious cooperative efforts to tackle mushrooming
crime, drug trafficking and corruption problems could
be enormously beneficial to the United States and a
large proportion of Africans.

The Sierra Leone peace accord signed in July 1999
illustrates that cooperative efforts can resolve long-
standing African conflicts. Nigeria played a
leadership role in this effort, working in concert with
the Economic Community of West African States and
supported by the international community. The July
1999 Organization for African Unity (OAV) initiative,
under Algeria’s energetic leadership, for peace
between Eritrea and Ethiopia is another such
example of cooperative peace efforts which we have
actively supported. We believe the Lusaka cease-fire
agreement of July 1999 can bring an end to the war
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and its
Joint Military Commission supports the evolution of a
regional collective security arrangement in Central
Africa. Additionally, we are working with the Angolan
government through a Bilateral Consultative
Commission (BCC) on key areas of mutual interest
such as regional security, humanitarian and social
issues, and economic reform.

45

Sudan continues to pose a threat to regional stability
and the national security interests of the United
States. We have moved to counter Sudan’s support
for international terrorism and regional destabilization
by imposing sanctions on the Khartoum regime,
continuing to press for the regime’s isolation through
the UN Security Council, and enhancing the ability of
Sudan’s neighbors to resist Khartoum-backed
insurgencies in their countries through our Frontline
States initiative. We support regional efforts for a just
and fair peace and national reconciliation in Sudan
based on the Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development's Declaration of Principles.

Persistent conflict and continuing political instability in
some African countries remain obstacles to Africa’s
development and to our national security, political
and economic interests there, including unhampered
access to oil reserves and other important natural
resources. To foster regional stability and peace in
Africa, the United States in 1996 launched the African
Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) to work with
Africans to enhance their capacity to conduct
effective peacekeeping and humanitarian operations.
We are coordinating with the French, British, other
donor countries and African governments in
developing a regional exercise program to promote
common doctrines and command and control
capability, and interoperability for peacekeeping
missions. We are consulting closely on ACRI activity
with the UN Department of Peacekeeping
Operations, the OAU and its Crisis Management
Center, and African sub-regional organizations
already pursuing similar capability enhancements.

The United States has established the African Center
for Strategic Studies (ACSS) to promote the
exchange of ideas and information tailored
specifically for African security concerns. The goal is
for ACSS to be a source of academic, yet practical,
instruction in promoting civil-military relations and the
skills necessary to make effective national security
decisions in democratic governments. The
curriculum will engage African military and civilian
defense leaders in a substantive dialogue about
defense policy planning, civil-military relations, and
defense resource management in democracies. Our
long-term goal is to support the development of
regional security arrangements and institutions to
prevent and manage armed conflicts and curtail
transnational threats to our collective security.

Promoting Prosperity

A stable, democratic, economically growing Africa will
be a better economic partner, a better partner for
security and peace, and a better partner in the fights
against drug trafficking, crime, terrorism, infectious
diseases and environmental degradation. Lasting
prosperity for Africa will be possible only when Africa
is fully integrated into the global economy.

Further integrating Africa into the global economy will
also directly serve U.S. interests by continuing to
expand an already important new market for U.S.
exports. The more than 700 million people of sub-
Saharan Africa represent one of the world’s largest
basically untapped markets. Although the United
States enjoys only a seven-percent market share in
Africa, already 100,000 American jobs depend on our
exports there. Increasing both the U.S. market share
and the size of the African market will bring tangible
benefits to U.S. workers and increase prosperity and
economic opportunity in Africa. Our aim, therefore, is
to assist African nations to implement economic
reforms, improve public governance and combat
corruption, create favorable climates for trade and
investment, and achieve sustainable development.

To support the economic transformation underway in
Africa, the President in June 1997 launched the
Partnership for Economic Growth and Opportunity in
Africa Initiative. The Administration has implemented
many of the Initiative’s objectives and continues to
work closely with Congress to implement remaining
key elements of this initiative through passage of the
African Growth and Opportunity Act. By significantly
broadening market access, spurring growth and
helping the poorest nations eliminate or reduce their
bilateral debt, the Initiative and the legislation will
better enable us to help African nations undertake
difficult economic reforms and build better lives for
their people through sustainable development.

We are working with African governments on shared
interests in the world trading system, such as
developing electronic commerce, improving WTO
capacity-building functions, and eliminating
agricultural export subsidies. We also are pursuing
initiatives to encourage U.S. trade with and
investment in Africa, including targeted technical
assistance, enhanced debt forgiveness, and
increased bilateral trade ties. We have led the

international community in efforts to address Africa’s
crippling debt, through the Cologne Initiative which
substantially deepens relief available under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.
We will continue to work with African countries to
manage and reduce the debt burden in order to
unleash the continent's economic potential.

To further our trade objectives in Africa, the Ron
Brown Commercial Center was established in
Johannesburg, South Africa in 1998. The Center
provides support for American companies looking to
enter or expand into the sub-Saharan African market,
promotes U.S. exports through a range of support
programs, and facilitates business contacts and
partnerships between African and American
businesses. The President's historic March 1998 trip
to Africa and the unprecedented March 1999 U.S.-
Africa Ministerial further solidified our partnership with
African nations across a range of security, economic
and political issues.

Helping Africans generate the food and income
necessary to feed themselves is critical for promoting
sustainable growth and development. Despite some
recent progress, the percentage of malnourished
people and lack of diversified sustainable agricultural
production in Africa is the highest of any region in the
world, and more help is greatly needed. In 1998 we
launched the Africa Food Security Initiative, a 10-year
U.S. Agency for International Development-led effort
to help improve agricultural productivity, support
research, expand income-generating projects, and
address nutritional needs for the rural poor.

African nations are also engaged in battle with
diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis, which
sap economic productivity and development. Worse,
the epidemic of HIV/AIDS continues to attack the
continent, threatening progress on development,
reducing life expectancy, and decreasing GDPs in
the hardest-hit nations. The Administration has made
the battle against AIDS and other diseases a priority
for international action and investment in Africa. Our
global AIDS Initiative has focused special attention
and earmarked resources for Africa.

Promoting Democracy

In Africa as elsewhere, democracies have proved
stronger partners for peace, stability and sustained

 

prosperity. We will continue to support the important
progress African nations have achieved and to
broaden the growing circle of African democracies.
The restoration of civilian democratic government in
Nigeria can help return that country to its place as a
leader in Africa. Over the past year, the government
and people of Nigeria have succeeded in restoring
democratic civilian government, freed political
prisoners, lifted onerous restrictions on labor unions,
and worked to restore the authority of the judicial
system. Nigeria’s new civilian government has taken
sweeping steps to ensure that the military remains in
the barracks and that fighting corruption will be a top
priority. The peaceful elections in February 1999 and
inauguration of the new civilian government in May
1999 were important steps in this transformation.

As in any democratic transition, Nigeria’s new
government is facing enormous challenges: creating
accountable government, building support within the
military for civilian rule, protecting human rights, and
rebuilding the economy so it benefits all citizens.
President Clinton met with President Obasanjo at the
White House in October 1999 and reaffirmed our
commitment to work with him on the challenges and
security, economic, political and social issues.

Through the Great Lakes Justice Initiative, the United
States is working to help end the cycle of violence
and impunity in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Rwanda and Burundi, and to support judicial systems
that are impartial, credible, effective and inclusive. In
addition, we will work with our allies to find an
effective formula for promoting stability, democracy
and respect for human rights in the Democratic
Republic of Congo so that it and a democratic Nigeria
can become the regional centers for economic
growth, and democratic empowerment that they can
and should be. In order to help post-apartheid South
Africa achieve its economic, political, democratic and
security goals for all its citizens, we will continue to
provide substantial bilateral assistance, vigorously
promote U.S. trade and investment, and pursue close
cooperation and support for our mutual interests.

Ultimately, the prosperity and security of Africa
depend on African leadership, strong national
institutions, and extensive political and economic
reform. The United States will continue to support
and promote such national reforms and the evolution
of regional arrangements that build cooperation
among African states.

IV. Conclusions

Today, as we reach the twenty-first century, we are
building new frameworks, partnerships and institutions
— and adapting existing ones — to strengthen America’s
security and prosperity. We are working to construct
new cooperative security arrangements and build
peace, contain weapons of mass destruction, fight
terrorism and international crime, rid the world of ethnic
cleansing and genocide, build a truly global economy,
and promote democratic values and economic reform.
This is a moment of historic opportunity to create a
safer, more democratic, and more prosperous
tomorrow -- a better future for our children and
grandchildren.

This promising state of affairs did not just happen, and
there is no guarantee that it will endure. The
contemporary era was forged by steadfast American
leadership over the last half century — through efforts
such as the Marshall Plan, NATO, our security ties in
the Pacific, the United Nations, the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The clear
dangers of the past made the need for national security
commitments and expenditures obvious to the
American people. Today, the task of mobilizing public
support for national security priorities is more
complicated. The complex array of unique dangers,
opportunities and responsibilities outlined in this
strategy are not always readily apparent as we go
about our daily lives focused on immediate concerns.
Yet, in a more integrated and interdependent world, we
must remain actively engaged in world affairs to
successfully advance our national interests.

To be secure and prosperous, America must continue
to lead. Our international leadership focuses on

 

President Clinton's strategic priorities: efforts to
promote peace and security in key regions of the
world; to create more jobs and opportunities for
Americans through a more open and competitive
trading system that also benefits others around the
world; to increase cooperation in confronting security
threats that threaten our critical infrastructures and
our citizens at home and abroad, yet often defy
borders and unilateral solutions; to strengthen
international arms control and nonproliferation
regimes; to protect the environment and the health of
our citizens; and to strengthen the intelligence,
military, diplomatic and law enforcement tools
necessary to meet these challenges.

Our international leadership is ultimately founded
upon the power of our democratic ideals and values.
The spread of democracy supports American values
and enhances our security and prosperity. The
United States will continue to support the trend
toward democracy and free markets, peace and
security by remaining actively engaged in the world.

Our engagement abroad requires the active, sustained
support of the American people and the bipartisan
support of the U.S. Congress. This Administration
remains committed to explaining our security interests,
objectives and priorities to the nation and seeking the
broadest possible public and congressional support for
our security programs and investments. We will
continue to exercise global leadership in a manner that
reflects our national values, promotes prosperity and
protects the security of this great nation.

Preface

As we enter the new millennium, we are blessed to be citizens of a country enjoying
record prosperity, with no deep divisions at home, no overriding external threats abroad,
and history's most powerful military ready to defend our interests around the world.
Americans of earlier eras may have hoped one day to live in a nation that could claim just
one of these blessings. Probably few expected to experience them all; fewer still all at
once.

Our success is cause for pride in what we've done, and gratitude for what we have
inherited. But the most important matter is what we now make of this moment. Some may
be tempted to believe that open markets and societies will inevitably spread in an era of
expanding global trade and communications, or assume that our wealth and power alone
will protect us from the troubles of the outside world. But that approach falls for the old
myth of an ""outside"" world, and ignores the defining features of our age: the rise of
interdependence. More than ever, prosperity and security in America depend on
prosperity and security around the globe. In this age, America can advance its interests
and ideals only by leading efforts to meet common challenges. We must deploy
America's financial, diplomatic and military resources to stand up for peace and security,
promote global prosperity, and advance democracy and human rights around the world.

This demands strengthening our alliances with Europe and Asia, and adapting them to
meet emerging challenges. Our alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger because they
are organized to advance a permanent set of shared interests, rather than to defeat a
single threat. We must continue working with our allies towards a peaceful, democratic,
undivided Europe, with NATO as a deterrent to new conflict and a magnet for new
democracies. In Asia, we must build on strategic alliance with Japan to define new
approaches to post-Cold War threats. And, we must enhance cooperation with South
Korea as we encourage North Korea's emergence from isolation and continue to diminish
the missile threat.

Just as we strengthen our alliances, we must build principled, constructive, clear-eyed
relations with our former adversaries Russia and China. We must be mindful of threats to
peace while also maximizing chances that both Russia and China move toward greater
internal openness, stability and prosperity, seizing on the desire of both countries to
participate in the global economy and global institutions, insisting that both accept the
obligations as well as the benefits of integration. With Russia, that means continuing our
work to reduce the nuclear danger, to assure strategic stability, and to define its future
role in Europe, while supporting the emergence of democratic institutions and the rule of
law. With China, that means continuing to press for adherence to nonproliferation
standards and peaceful dialogue with Taiwan, while holding Chinese leaders to the
conditions of entry into the WTO, which offer the best hope of internal reform.

To protect the peace and promote security, we must work to resolve conflicts before they
escalate and harm vital U.S. interests. In the 1990s, the United States has been actively
engaged in seeking peace in the Middle East, in the Balkans, between Greece and
Turkey, between India and Pakistan, in Northern Ireland, between Peru and Ecuador,
and Eritrea and Ethiopia. These efforts, undertaken in partnership with friends and allies,
help to avert wider conflicts that might endanger global stability, ease humanitarian
catastrophes, while adding moral authority to America's might in the world. American
overwhelming power and influence is far less likely to breed resentment if it is used to
advance the cause of peace.

We also must identify and address new national security challenges, accentuated by new
technology and open borders. We have identified a new security agenda that addresses
contemporary threats such as the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons, terrorism, and international crime. New efforts must continue to build on
initiatives such as the extension of the Nonproliferation Treaty, the containment of nations
seeking to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction, increased antiterrorism
cooperation, stepped up efforts to combat trafficking in drugs, arms, and human- beings,
and our first-ever national strategy for cybersecurity. Our new security agenda recognizes
that in a global age, threats to America do not simply come from determined enemies and
deadly weapons. Our efforts to curb global warming through the Kyoto protocol are vital
to protect America from a future of rising sea levels and economic disruption. Our
leadership in the international fight against infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, is
critical to defeat a threat that kills massively, crosses frontiers and destabilizes whole
regions.

Finally, there can be no security where there is no hope of prosperity. We must continue
to promote the spread of global markets in ways that advance economic growth, honor
our values, and help alleviate economic disparity. We must build on the creation of the
WTO, and of NAFTA, on the passage of PNTR for China, on extending trade preferences
to nations in Africa and the Caribbean Basin, and on the nearly 300 trade agreements we
have signed that have contributed to the longest U.S. economic expansion in history. At
the same time, we must understand that trade, by itself, is not enough to lift the most
desperate nations out of poverty or prevent the world from becoming bitterly divided
between haves and have nots. That's why we have led in promoting the HIPC initiative to
provide deeper debt reduction for countries with unsustainable debt burdens, and placed
global development issues at the forefront of the international agenda.

More than 50 years ago, Harry Truman said: ""We are in a position now of making the
world safe for democracy, if we don't crawl in a shell and act selfish and foolish."" He
believed that in the wake of our triumph in World War II, America had the ability and a
responsibility to shape world events, so that we would not be shaped by them. Truman
was right, and the historical forces he saw then have only intensified since the Cold War.

The ability to assure global security, shared prosperity and freedom is beyond the power
of any one nation. But the actions of many nations often follow from the actions of one.
America today has power and authority never seen before in the history of the world. We
must continue use it, in partnership with those who share our values, to seize the
opportunities and meet the challenges of a global age.

William J. Clinton

|. | Fundamentals of the Strategy
Goals of the Engagement Strategy

Since the end of the Cold War, the United States and its allies have developed a position
of extraordinary strength. As the last decade of the 20th century unfolded, the United
States sought to use that strength wisely and in a manner consistent with the
fundamental values and ideals on which our republic was founded. The world is
undergoing an accelerating process of globalization in which technology is developing
exponentially; information is exchanged around the globe cheaply and instantaneously;
economies are increasingly interdependent; borders are more porous; people seek
political and economic freedoms; and groups seek expression of their ethnic identity.
Some of these trends add to our strength and security. Others present new challenges.
All entail great transformation and prescribe new imperatives for defining our Nation's role
in this rapidly changing era.

In a democracy, a nation's foreign policy and security strategy must serve the needs of
the people. At the dawn of the 21st century, our world is very different from that of our
Founding Fathers, yet the basic objectives in the preamble to the Constitution remain
timeless:

provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the
blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.

The changes we have seen in the last decade do not alter these fundamental purposes.
They merely blur the dividing line between domestic and foreign policy and heighten the
imperative for a cohesive set of active U.S. efforts, both at home and abroad, to pursue
three modern day goals derived from the preamble's objectives: enhancing security at
home and abroad, promoting prosperity, and promoting democracy and human
rights. To accomplish these three goals in an ever-shrinking world, we have developed a
series of policies, now recognized as the elements of our strategy for engagement.

Elements of the Strategy

Shaping the International Environment

A primary element of our strategy of engagement has been to help fashion a new
international system that promotes peace, stability, and prosperity. This has involved
remolding and shaping both sides of the Cold War bipolar system. It has meant both
adapting our alliances and encouraging the reorientation of other states, including
former adversaries.

The United States has led the transformation of what were defensive entities into
proactive instruments for meeting post-Cold War challenges. Under U.S. leadership,
NATO -- our most important Cold War alliance -- has formally revised its strategic
concept, successfully ended aggression in Bosnia and Kosovo, and brought new

members into the Alliance while holding out the prospect of further enlargement. It has
increasingly pursued new initiatives and missions such as the Partnership for Peace
(PFP) and peacekeeping operations with partners to help stabilize the continent. New
dialogue between historic adversaries interested in joining NATO has helped to reconcile
several long-standing disputes among countries in the region. Further challenges exist,
but the signs of progress and nature of the changes are encouraging.

Other important security arrangements we forged in the Cold War remain strong in the
post-Cold War world. For instance, in 1997 the United States and Japan revised their
guidelines for defense cooperation. Our security commitments to the Republic of Korea
and Australia also remain strong, as do our defense relations with Thailand and the
Philippines, and new security cooperation exists with our friends in the Persian Gulf
region.

Nations with whom we had been philosophically opposed during much of the Cold War
are in the process of tremendous political and economic change. Our engagement with
these states over the last eight years has been focused on encouraging them to
undertake important political and economic reforms while at the same time dissuading
them from regressing into confrontational relationships. Our efforts with the most
populous of these nations -- China and Russia -- have been intended to offer
opportunities and incentives for proactive participation, while also encouraging them to be
responsible members of the world community. This means progress in respecting the
rights of individuals and nations in areas as diverse as the environment, humanitarian
issues, the rule of law, and economic fairness. While the outcome of transformation in
these nations is not altogether certain, our engagement has had a positive impact on
both regional and global stability.

The United States has sought to strengthen the post-Cold War international system by
encouraging democratization, open markets, free trade, and sustainable
development. These efforts have produced measurable results. The number of
democracies, as a percentage of world states, has increased by 14% since 1992. For the
first time in history, over half of the world's population lives under democratic governance.
Our national security is a direct beneficiary of democracy's spread, as democracies are
less likely to go to war with one another, more likely to become partners for peace and
security, and more likely to pursue peaceful means of internal conflict resolution that
promote both intrastate and regional stability.

The globalization of trade and investment, spurred by new technologies, open borders,
and increasingly open societies, is a critical aspect of the 21st century world. United
States efforts to expand trade and investment with both traditional and new trading
partners fuel growth in our economy. United States efforts to extend market reforms to
former adversaries and neutrals also enhance our security by increasing economic
cooperation, empowering reformers, and promoting openness and democracy overseas.
Economic freedoms routinely facilitate political freedoms. In addition to these
opportunities, economic globalization also presents its proponents with tough challenges,
such as assisting countries that embrace but are nonetheless left behind by the dynamics
of globalization or working with countries that reject these dynamics for fear of losing their
cultural or national identity.

Preventing conflict has been a hallmark of U.S. foreign policy under a strategy of
engagement. All over the world, the United States has selectively used diplomatic means,
economic aid, military presence, and deterrence as tools for promoting peace. We also
assist other countries to develop their own defense capabilities through our foreign
assistance and security assistance programs. In doing so, we have focused on the

threats and opportunities most relevant to our interests as well as our values, and applied
our resources where we can make the greatest difference.

Responding to Threats and Crises

The persistence of major interstate conflict has required us to maintain the means for
countering potential regional aggressors. Long-standing tensions and territorial
division on the Korean peninsula and territorial ambitions in the Persian Gulf currently
define the main tenets of this requirement. For the foreseeable future, the United States,
preferably in concert with allies, must have the capability to deter -- and if that fails, to
defeat -- large-scale, cross-border aggression in two distant theaters in overlapping time
frames.

Globally, as a result of more porous borders, rapid changes in technology, greater
information flow, and the potential destructive power within the reach of small states,
groups, and individuals, the United States finds itself confronting new threats that pose
strategic challenges to our interests and values. These include the potential use and
continued proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their means of
delivery, proliferation of small arms and light weapons, threats to our information/cyber
security, international migrant smuggling and trafficking in persons, and the ability to
disrupt our critical infrastructure. As a result, defense of the homeland against WMD
terrorism has taken on a new importance, making coordinated Federal, state, and local
government efforts imperative. The Domestic Preparedness Program has received
significant resources to address immediate threats to our security. Ongoing efforts on
National Missile Defense are developing the capability to defend the fifty states against a
limited missile attack from states that threaten international peace and security.
Prevention remains our first line of defense to lessen the availability of weapons of mass
destruction being sought by such aggressor nations. To that end, we continue to work
with Russia to control possible leakage of former Soviet nuclear, chemical, and biological
weapons materials and expertise to proliferant states.

We are also vigorously pursuing a strengthening of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
the Chemical and Biological Weapons Conventions, the Missile Technology Control
Regime, and entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty at the
earliest possible time. Other persistent threats to our security in peacetime include
international terrorism, drug trafficking, other organized crime, and environmental
degradation. The United States has made great strides in restructuring its national
security apparatus to address new threats with diplomatic, economic, and military tools.

Fragmentation of a number of states, which helped lead to the collapse of the Cold War's
bipolar alignment, has caused turmoil within several regions of the world. This turmoil, a
result of re-awakened ethnic and religious divisions and territorial ambitions, has reignited
old conflicts and resulted in substantial bloodshed. U.S. leadership in steering
international peace and stability operations has restored and maintained peace ina
number of locations. We have been more inclined to act where our interests and values
are both at stake and where our resources can affect tangible improvement, as in Bosnia
and Kosovo. In each of these instances, atrocities against, and the expulsion of, people
in the heart of Europe undermined the very values over which we had fought two World
Wars and the Cold War. Left unchecked, they could have spread elsewhere throughout
Europe and harmed the NATO alliance. We thus saw that our interests and values were
affected to a sufficient degree to warrant U.S. military intervention in both Bosnia and
Kosovo.

As we look to the future, our strategy must therefore be sufficiently robust so that when
we choose to engage, we can do so to prevent conflict, assist failing states, or counter
potential regional aggressors as necessary.

Preparing for an Uncertain Future

Meeting this widening array of new threats to our security will require us to transform our
capabilities and organizations. Within our military, this transformation has taken several
forms: focused science and technology efforts; concept development and
experimentation by the Services, combatant commands, and the Joint Staff; robust
processes to implement change; and new approaches to foster a culture of bold
innovation and dynamic leadership.

The process of transformation must not end solely with defense. Preparation must also
include diplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement, and economic efforts if we are to meet
the new threats that rapidity of technological change brings to the hands of adversaries,
potential and actual. Our government is therefore implementing interagency approaches
to formulate, and then execute, policy and plans for dealing with potential contingencies.
In addition, preventative diplomacy, often undergirded by the deterrence of our full
military capabilities, may help contain or resolve problems before they erupt into crises or
contingency operations.

Summary

The elements of engagement -- adapting alliances; encouraging the reorientation of other
states, including former adversaries; encouraging democratization, open markets, free
trade, and sustainable development; preventing conflict; countering potential regional
aggressors; confronting new threats; and steering international peace and stability
operations -- define the Nation's blueprint for a strategy of engagement. These elements
support three strategic concepts for engagement: shaping the international environment,
responding to threats and crises, and preparing for an uncertain future. The blueprint and
the concepts it supports have served the United States well in a rapidly changing world.
Refined by experience, the strategy is a wise roadmap for national security in the 21st
century.

Guiding Principles of Engagement

Both our goals, and the policies we pursue to achieve these goals, must reflect two
guiding principles that influence both our national character and legacy: protecting our
national interests and advancing our values. Throughout history, all sovereign nations
have been guided by protection of their national interests, even if they have defined these
interests quite differently. Many countries have also been guided by a desire to advance
their values. Few, however, have chosen to advance those values principally through the
power of their example instead of the might of their military. Historically, the United States
has chosen to let our example be the strongest voice of our values. Both our goals and
the policies we pursue to achieve these goals reflect these guiding principles.

Protecting our National Interests

Our national interests are wide-ranging. They cover those requirements essential to the
survival and well being of our Nation as well as the desire to see us, and others, abide by
principles such as the rule of law, upon which our republic was founded.

We divide our national interests into three categories: vital, important, and humanitarian.
Vital interests are those directly connected to the survival, safety, and vitality of our
nation. Among these are the physical security of our territory and that of our allies, the
safety of our citizens both at home and abroad, protection against WMD proliferation, the
economic well-being of our society, and the protection of our critical infrastructures--
including energy, banking and finance, telecommunications, transportation, water
systems, vital human services, and government services--from disruption intended to
cripple their operation. We will do what we must to defend these interests. This may
involve the use of military force, including unilateral action, where deemed necessary or
appropriate.

The second category, important national interests, affects our national well being or that
of the world in which we live. Principally, this may include developments in regions where
America holds a significant economic or political stake, issues with significant global
environmental impact, infrastructure disruptions that destabilize but do not cripple smooth
economic activity, and crises that could cause destabilizing economic turmoil or
humanitarian movement. Examples of when we have acted to protect important national
interests include our successful efforts to end the brutal conflict and restore peace in
Kosovo, or our assistance to our Asian and Pacific allies and friends in support of the
restoration of order and transition to nationhood in East Timor.

The third category is humanitarian and other longer-term interests. Examples include
reacting to natural and manmade disasters; acting to halt gross violations of human
rights; supporting emerging democracies; encouraging adherence to the rule of law and
civilian control of the military; conducting Joint Recovery Operations worldwide to account
for our country's war dead; promoting sustainable development and environmental
protection; or facilitating humanitarian demining.

Threats or challenges to our national interests could require a range of responses.
Wherever possible, we seek to avert conflict or relieve humanitarian disasters through
diplomacy and cooperation with a wide range of partners, including other governments,
international institutions, and non-governmental organizations. Prevention of crises,
through the proactive use of such diplomatic, economic, political and military presence
tools, will not only save lives but also will prevent a much greater drain of fiscal resources
than its alternative -- managing conflict.

Advancing American Values

The protection of national interests is not the sole factor behind the various expressions
of U.S. national resolve. Since the beginning of our democracy, our policies and actions
have also been guided by our core values -- political and economic freedom, respect for
human rights, and the rule of law. In keeping with these values, we have lent our
encouragement, support, and assistance to those nations and peoples that freely desire
to achieve those same blessings of liberty. Pursuing policies that are guided by these
values, and the open economic and political processes through which they are typically
manifested, will in the long term strengthen international peace and stability, and
reinforce the positive aspects of globalization.

Where Interests Meet Values

There are times when the nexus of our interests and values exists in a compelling
combination that demands action -- diplomatic, economic, or military. At times throughout
our history, our survival as a nation has been at stake and military action was the only
possible recourse. On other occasions, our survival as a nation has not been at stake but
our national interests have nonetheless been challenged. When such challenges to our
interests occur in concert with morally compelling challenges to our values, the American
people expect their government to take action. During the course of this Administration,
we have employed military force only in circumstances in which our national interests
were at stake and our values were challenged.

Preserving our interests and values has never been without cost, and every generation
has been asked to bear a portion of the price of freedom. From a bridge at Concord over
two centuries ago to the air over Kosovo last year, on numerous occasions Americans
have been called upon to stand up for their interests, interests which are often
inextricably linked with their values.

Today, 250,000 U.S. forces are stationed or deployed overseas to protect and advance
our nation's interests and values -- down from a Cold War peak of 500,000. Of this, we
maintain a continuous overseas presence of over 200,000 in places like Germany,
Japan, and South Korea, while about 30,000 are currently involved in operations. These
include nearly 20,000 stationed around the Persian Gulf to contain Iraq, roughly 10,000 in
Bosnia and Kosovo, and 1,000 in the Sinai. Other forces, such as those rotationally
deployed to the Mediterranean, the Pacific Ocean and the Arabian Gulf, remain involved
in routine operations. Our diplomatic corps -- the Civil and Foreign Services -- also bear
an important part of protecting and advancing our interests, often in the furthest reaches
of the globe, through embassies, consulates, and missions worldwide.

The Efficacy of Engagement

Our strategy of engagement has allowed us to accrue a range of benefits, including
sustained, relative peace, expanded trade and investment opportunities brought by
globalization, and a large increase in the number of states that share our democratic
values. We have exercised strong leadership in the international community to shape the
international security environment in ways that promote peace, stability, prosperity, and
democratic governance. We have transformed our alliances and reinvigorated
relationships with friends and partners; forged broad relationships with former
adversaries; fostered new relations with transitional states; and deterred major hostilities.

Enhancing Our Security at Home and Abroad

There are clear indicators that engagement is achieving our national security goals in this
rapidly changing world. First, engagement has produced many benefits that enhance our
security at home and abroad. The overseas presence of our military forces helps deter or
even prevent conflict. It assures our allies of our support and displays our resolve to
potential enemies. It allows for maximum military cooperation with our allies and therefore
encourages burdensharing. Forward-deployed forces permit us to identify emerging
security problems, and then facilitate a swift response, if necessary. Ongoing operations
in Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe have improved the current security
environment by ensuring that a return to peace is sustained. Our new embassies in the

countries of the former Soviet Union, and in some 140 other countries, allow the U.S. to
advance America's interests and values in real time, and to immediately detect
opportunities and challenges to these interests. Other aspects of our engagement
policies, such as non-proliferation programs like the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative
(ETRI), have, within the framework of START 1, stabilized the security environment. Over
5,000 nuclear warheads, 600 missile launchers, 540 land-based and submarine launched
inter-continental ballistic missiles, 64 heavy bombers, and 15 missile submarines have
been deactivated and potential proliferation of WMD or their delivery means averted.
These efforts have made the world a much safer place.

We have also seen international engagement enhance our ability to address asymmetric
threats to our security, such as acts of terrorism and the desired procurement and use of
WMD by potential regional aggressors. International counterterrorism cooperation, for
example, led to the pre-emptive arrest of individuals planning to terrorize Americans at
home and abroad celebrating the Millennium. Engagement efforts have already
assembled an impressive record of international cooperation to harmonize legislation on
terrorist offenses, conduct research and development, and create databases on
terrorism. Strong U.S. overseas presence and engagement, enhanced by a network of
multilateral agreements and arrangements, has enabled us to contain the proliferation of
nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and their means of delivery by potential
regional aggressors. Inspections done at point of origin for goods destined for the U.S.
improves our nonproliferation and border security efforts and even enhances cargo
throughput. In other cases, it has actually interrupted the flow of sensitive goods to those
countries. Robust engagement in support of law enforcement efforts of partner nations
has resulted in the dismantling of a number of major drug trafficking organizations and
the interdiction of significant quantities of elicit [sic] drugs that would otherwise have
reached U.S. or other consumer markets. Together, efforts that focus on asymmetric
threats to our security will reduce our potential vulnerability despite an increasingly inter-
connected world.

Economic Benefits that Promote Prosperity

Engagement has had clear economic benefits that promote prosperity around the globe.
This strategy provides stability to the world economic system on which the U.S. economy
depends. Our involvement in international economic organizations like the G-8, G-20,
World Trade Organization (WTO) and Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) has helped build stable, resilient global economic and financial
systems that promote strong, global prosperity. The U.S. - China Bilateral WTO
agreement, for example, will reduce China's tariffs on U.S. priority agricultural products
from an average of 31% to 14%. It will reduce similar tariffs on U.S. industrial products
from 24.6% to 9.4%. Such agreements expand U.S. market access and bring new goods
and services to these markets at lower cost. Overall, the Administration has concluded
304 trade agreements, and created a series of new fora for economic dialogue, that now
include the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the Transatlantic
Economic Partnership, and the ongoing development work on the Free Trade Area of the
Americas (FTAA). This has led to numerous economic and financial agreements/reforms
in international institutions that bring stability to the global marketplace that is so essential
for America's economic health and economic security. As a result, total U.S. exports of
goods and services have grown by over 75% since 1992. Measures to strengthen the
architecture of the international financial system, including through increased
transparency and reform of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, have
helped put the international economy on a sound footing after recent financial crises and
build a stronger global financial system. In addition, WTO agreements to strengthen and
expand trade in information technology goods, financial services, basic

telecommunications services, and electronic commerce have secured open markets in
sectors key to American economic vitality, and laid the groundwork for future
liberalization in agriculture, services, and other areas.

Military presence and engagement activities can also provide similar economic stability.
Our naval presence ensures that international waters, the sea lines of communication,
and ports remain open to commercial shipping, and our ground, air, and naval forces in
Southwest Asia deter threats to the free flow of Middle East oil. The clearest and longest
standing example of what overseas presence can do for economic stability is found in the
sizeable U.S. military force found on the Korean peninsula since 1953. Currently 37,000
strong, U.S. forces have helped the South Koreans rebuild and grow, and now both sides
support the continued presence of U.S. forces as a measure of stability. U.S. actions that
protect the free flow of natural resources and finished goods provide an environment for
sustained economic productivity. Engagement, through military, diplomatic, or other
governmental entities, also enables rapid response to computer network incidents and
attacks that harm our economy. International government-to-government cooperation, for
example, led to the law enforcement action that definitively determined the source of
some of the distributed, denial of service attacks in February 2000.

Promoting Democracy and Human Rights

Finally, engagement has had political and diplomatic benefits that promote democracy
and human rights. Our policies bring our country's strengths directly to international
publics, governments, and militaries, with the hope that this exposure may inspire others
to promote democracy and the free market. Whether we're advising foreign governments
on the conduct of free elections, teaching foreign troops about the importance of civilian
control of the military, aiding international relief agencies in the wake of natural disasters,
or in the diplomatic day-to-day efforts of our diplomats in 273 missions around the world,
an engaged America brings its values to the world's doorstep. For example, the multi-
faceted program for engagement in Africa is having a clear impact on the cultivation of
democracy on the continent. From Kampala to Cape Town, from Dakar to Dar-es-
Salaam, Africans have new hopes for democracy, peace, and prosperity. Although many
challenges yet remain, visible change is occurring. Through our diplomatic missions, over
20 nations across Africa have requested and are receiving assistance to develop
judiciary, legal, media, and civil society systems to build necessary institutions to sustain
democratic ideals. We are assisting democratic transitions in Nigeria and South Africa.

In our own hemisphere, our engagement efforts have promoted free and fair elections
throughout the hemisphere. In Southeast Europe, the Dayton Accords have sustained the
peace in Bosnia, permitted a civil society with opposition parties and non-governmental
organizations to take root, begun reforms of police and court systems, and allowed
national and local elections to take place. The transformation is not complete and
progress is not irreversible, but it is unmistakable. The best role model is a visible one.

In summary, a strategy of engagement reaps significant benefits for our Nation -- benefits
that actively support our goals of security, prosperity and democracy, yet always remain
in consonance with our principles of protecting our national interests and advancing our
values. Indeed, there is no other viable policy choice in this global era.

Il. Implementing the Strategy

Into the 21st century, the United States must continue to adapt to changes brought by
globalization such that we foster close cooperative relations with the world's most
influential nations while preserving our ability to shape those nations capable of having
an adverse effect upon our well-being and way of life. A stable, peaceful international
security environment is the desired endstate -- one in which our nation, citizens and
interests are not threatened. It is important that we work to enhance the health and safety
of our citizens by promoting a cleaner global environment and effective strategies to
combat infectious disease. We must work to ensure that the United States continues to
prosper through increasingly open international markets and sustainable growth in the
global economy, and that democratic values, respect for human rights, and the rule of law
are increasingly accepted.

Chapter II describes how we intend to utilize the instruments at our disposal to implement
our strategy for engagement and, in the process, achieve the goals of security,
prosperity, and democracy -- our vision for ourselves and others in the 21st century.

Enhancing Security at Home and Abroad

Our strategy for enhancing U.S. security has three principal elements: shaping the
international security environment, responding to threats and crises, and preparing for an
uncertain future.

Shaping the International Environment

The United States seeks to shape the international environment through a variety of
means, including diplomacy, economic cooperation, international assistance, arms
control and nonproliferation efforts, military presence and engagement activities, and
global health initiatives. These activities enhance U.S. security by promoting regional
security; enhancing economic progress; supporting military activities abroad, international
law enforcement cooperation, and environmental efforts; and preventing, reducing or
deterring the diverse threats we face today. These measures adapt and strengthen
alliances and friendships, maintain U.S. influence in key regions, and encourage
adherence to international norms.

The U.S. intelligence community provides various Federal agencies with critical support
for the full range of our involvement abroad. Comprehensive collection and analytic
capabilities are needed to provide warning of threats to U.S. national security, give
analytical support to the policy, law enforcement, and military communities, enable near-
real time intelligence while retaining global perspective, identify opportunities for
advancing our national interests, and maintain our information advantage in the
international arena. We place the highest priority on monitoring the most serious threats
to U.S. security. These include countries or other entities potentially hostile to the United
States; proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and their means of
delivery; other transnational threats, including terrorism, drug trafficking, proliferation of
small arms and light weapons, other international crime, and potential threats to our
critical infrastructure such as computer network attack; potential regional conflicts that
might affect U.S. national security interests; illegal economic or uncontrolled refugee
migration; and threats to U.S. forces and citizens abroad.

Diplomacy

Active diplomacy is critical to advancing our national security. The work of our missions
and representatives around the world serves a number of shaping functions. Examples
include adapting alliances, as the State and Defense Departments do when they work to
ensure that NATO ""candidate"" militaries will be interoperable with those of current NATO
members; deterring aggression, mediating disputes, and resolving conflicts as shown by
our efforts to dampen the momentum to conflict in South Asia and the Middle East;
promoting the trade and investment opportunities that increase U.S. economic prosperity;
and confronting new threats.

While crisis management is an important foreign policy function, crisis prevention is far
preferable. Throughout the 1990s, the United States has most frequently chosen a policy
of preventive diplomacy to avert conflict as well as humanitarian and other emergencies.
Bringing disputing parties to the table is less costly in lives and resources than separating
warring parties; helping failing states is less burdensome than rebuilding failed states;
and feeding the hungry is far more effective and easier than treating victims of diseases
wrought by malnutrition.

Our diplomatic efforts are often multilateral. Consistent with our global leadership role, it
is incumbent upon the United States to maintain its financial and political support for
international institutions such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank, and the World Trade Organization. We must continue to work to ensure we
meet our financial obligations to international organizations.

Likewise, domestically, we must remain committed to supporting the State Department,
the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Peace Corps, and other vehicles of
U.S. diplomacy. Our diplomatic infrastructure must be updated to meet critical
productivity and information age requirements to effectively serve our diplomatic and
consular efforts worldwide. Modernization of embassies, consulates, and our diplomatic
telecommunications and information infrastructure is essential to advancing and
protecting vital national interests overseas. Our embassies and consulates host critical
elements of peacetime power: diplomatic personnel, commercial, defense, and legal
attaches, and consular and security officers dedicated to protecting Americans at home
and abroad. Our commitment in properly resourcing these modernization plans is
essential if we are to have the future diplomatic infrastructure capable of supporting and
enhancing our leadership role worldwide.

Such enhancements to our diplomatic infrastructure will also help attract a new
generation of professionals whose skill, dedication, and creativity are at the heart of our
ability to use diplomacy to protect American interests. To both attract and retain these
individuals, we must take every measure to keep our personnel safe overseas. The State
Department is therefore implementing a broad program of security enhancements in
response to continued threats of terrorism directed at U.S. diplomatic and consular
facilities overseas. The investment is warranted. The cost to sustain and protect the
diplomatic components of our peacetime power is a tiny fraction of the price associated
with the crises averted by their presence.

Public Diplomacy

We have an obligation and opportunity to harness the tools of public diplomacy to
advance U.S. leadership around the world by engaging international publics on U.S.
principles and policies. The global advance of individual freedom and information
technologies like the Internet has increased the ability of citizens and organizations to

influence the policies of governments to an unprecedented extent. This makes our public
diplomacy -- efforts to transmit information and messages to peoples around the world --
an increasingly vital component of our national security strategy. Our programs enhance
our nation's ability to inform and influence foreign publics in support of our national
interests, and broaden the dialogue between U.S. citizens and institutions and their
counterparts abroad. Some even improve mutual understanding by reaching out to future
leaders and inform the opinions of current leaders through academic, professional, and
cultural exchanges. Successful diplomatic relations between the United States and other
countries depend upon establishing trust and creating credible partnerships based on this
trust.

Effective use of our nation's information capabilities to counter misinformation and
incitement, mitigate inter-ethnic conflict, promote independent media organizations and
the free flow of information, and support democratic participation helps advance U.S.
interests abroad. International Public Information activities, as defined by Presidential
Decision Directive 68 (PDD-68), are designed to improve our capability to coordinate
independent public diplomacy, public affairs and other national security information-
related efforts to ensure they are more successfully integrated into foreign and national
security policy making and execution.

International Assistance

The United States has a history of providing generous foreign assistance in an effort to
promote global stability. From the Marshall Plan to the present, our foreign assistance
has expanded free markets, promoted democracy and human rights, contained major
health threats, encouraged sustainable global population growth, promoted
environmental protection, and defused humanitarian crises.

Expanding debt relief is a key element of our international assistance agenda. In 1999,
the G-8 agreed to a reduction in bilateral debt between member countries and Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). This effort encourages international financial institutions
to link debt reduction to other efforts to alleviate poverty, promote economic
development, and thereby create stronger partners around the world for trade and
investment, security, and democracy. To show our commitment to this agreement we
have stood firmly behind efforts to provide 100% debt relief in countries where the funds
being used to service bilateral debt will finance the basic human needs of a population.

The United States intends that these nations not be left behind, instead joining in the
positive economic prosperity made possible through participation in the international
economic community. Our role in the World Bank and other multilateral development
banks supports mutual goals to provide developing countries with the financial and
technical assistance necessary to assimilate them into the global economy. Such efforts
lift peoples out of poverty, and typically result in substantial growth of U.S. exports to the
aided countries.

Finally, our philanthropic history is such that we routinely act to mitigate human suffering
in the wake of both natural and man-made disasters. From the U.S. Agency for
International Development's disaster assistance and food aid, to the State Department's
refugee assistance, to grants to non-governmental relief organizations, to the Defense
Department's Humanitarian Assistance Program, the United States has found multiple
avenues to relieve the suffering of disaster victims worldwide with coordinated targeted
relief efforts.

Arms Control and Nonproliferation

Arms control and nonproliferation initiatives are an essential element of our national
security strategy of enhancing security at home and abroad. They closely complement
and strengthen our efforts to defend our nation through our own military strength while
seeking to make the world a less dangerous place. We pursue verifiable arms control and
nonproliferation agreements that support our efforts to prevent the spread and use of
NBC weapons, materials, expertise, and means of delivery; halt the use of conventional
weapons that cause unnecessary suffering; and contribute to regional stability at lower
levels of armaments. In addition, by increasing transparency in the size, structure and
operations of military forces and building confidence in the intentions of other countries,
arms control agreements and confidence-building measures constrain inventories of
dangerous weapons, reduce incentives and opportunities to initiate an attack, reduce the
mutual suspicions that arise from and spur on armaments competition, and help provide
the assurance of security necessary to strengthen cooperative relationships and direct
resources to safer, more productive endeavors.

Verifiable reductions in strategic offensive arms and the steady shift toward less
destabilizing systems remain essential to our strategy. The START | Treaty's entry into
force in December 1994 charted the course for reductions in the deployed strategic
nuclear forces of the United States and the former Soviet Union. The other countries of
the former Soviet Union, besides Russia, that had nuclear weapons on their soil --
Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine -- have become non-nuclear weapons states under the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). If the START II Treaty enters into force, the
United States and Russia will each be limited to 3,000 to 3,500 strategic nuclear
weapons. START II also will prohibit land-based missiles from being deployed with more
than one warhead and eliminate heavy land-based missiles entirely. On September 26,
1997, the United States and Russia signed a START II Protocol extending the end date
for reductions to 2007, and exchanged letters on early deactivation by 2003 of those
strategic nuclear delivery systems to be eliminated by 2007. The Senate approved the
ratification of START Il in January 1996; the Duma ratified the START II Treaty and the
1997 START II Protocol in April 2000.

At the Helsinki Summit in March 1997, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to START
Ill guidelines that, if adopted, will cap the number of strategic nuclear warheads deployed
in each country at 2,000 - 2,500 by the end of 2007 -- reducing both our arsenals by 80%
from Cold War heights. They also agreed that, in order to promote the irreversibility of
deep reductions, a START Ill agreement will include measures relating to the
transparency of strategic nuclear warhead inventories and the destruction of strategic
nuclear warheads. In addition, the Presidents agreed to explore possible confidence-
building and transparency measures relating to nuclear long-range, sea-launched cruise
missiles and tactical nuclear systems.

The Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty remains a cornerstone of strategic stability, and
the United States is committed to continue efforts to enhance the Treaty's viability and
effectiveness. On September 26, 1997, representatives of the United States, Russia,
Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine signed or initialed five agreements relating to the ABM
Treaty. At the Cologne G-8 Summit in June 1999, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin
reiterated their determination to achieve earliest possible ratification and entry into force
of those agreements. The two presidents also reaffirmed at Cologne their existing
obligations under Article XIII of the ABM Treaty to consider possible changes in the
strategic situation that have a bearing on the ABM Treaty and, as appropriate, possible
proposals for further increasing the viability of the Treaty. They also agreed to begin
discussions on the ABM Treaty in parallel with discussions on START Ill. The United
States has proposed that the ABM Treaty be modified to accommodate possible
deployment of a limited National Missile Defense (NMD) system that would counter new

threats by states that threaten international peace and security while preserving strategic
stability.

At the June 4, 2000, Moscow summit, Presidents Clinton and Putin signed a Joint
Statement of Principles on Strategic Stability. The Principles state that the international
community faces a dangerous and growing threat of proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and their means of delivery, including missiles and missile technologies, and
that there is a need to address these threats. The Principles recalled the existing
provisions of the ABM Treaty, to consider changes in the strategic situation that have a
bearing on the provisions of the treaty, and, as appropriate, to consider possible
proposals for further increasing the viability of the Treaty. The Principles also record
agreement to intensify discussions on both ABM issues and START III.

The United States has also made clear to Russia that we are prepared to engage in
serious cooperation to address the emerging ballistic missile threat, and we have
identified a number of specific ideas for discussion. At the same June 4, 2000, Moscow
Summit, Presidents Clinton and Putin signed an agreement to establish a Joint Center for
exchanging early warning data on ballistic missile launches. The agreement will
significantly reduce the danger that ballistic missiles could be launched inadvertently on
false warning of attack. It will also promote increased mutual confidence in the
capabilities of the ballistic missile early warning systems of both sides. The Presidents
also agreed to explore more far-reaching cooperation to address missile threats.

On July 21, 2000, in Okinawa, Presidents Clinton and Putin issued a Joint Statement on
Cooperation on Strategic Stability, which identifies specific areas and projects for
cooperation to control the spread of missiles, missile technology, and weapons of mass
destruction. On September 6, 2000, in New York, Presidents Clinton and Putin signed a
Joint Statement on the Strategic Stability Cooperation Initiative and Implementation Plan,
which provides further detail and an agreed timetable for pursuing cooperation in these
areas, including the establishment of a ballistic missile and space launch vehicle pre-
launch notification regime in which other states would be invited to participate. Most
recently, the United States and Russia signed a bilateral pre-launch notification
agreement on December 16, 2000.

To be secure, we must not only have a strong military; we must also take the lead in
building a safer, more responsible world. We have a fundamental responsibility to limit
the spread of nuclear weapons and reduce the danger of nuclear war. To this end, the
United States remains committed to bringing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) into force.

To date, 160 countries have signed -- and 68 have ratified -- the Treaty prohibiting all
nuclear explosions. The 68 include 31 of the 44 countries named in the Treaty whose
ratification is necessary for entry into force. The CTBT will, in effect, constrain nuclear
weapons development. The United States ended nuclear testing eight years ago; upon
entry into force, the CTBT will require other state entities to also refrain from testing. We
are confident in the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, and we are
confident that a fully supported and sustained stockpile stewardship program will enable
us to continue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent capability. However, if we find we
cannot, we would have the option of using our supreme national interest withdrawal rights
under the Treaty in order to conduct whatever nuclear testing is necessary.

The CTBT will put in place a worldwide network of sensors for detecting nuclear
explosions. With over 300 stations around the globe -- including 31 in Russia, 11 in
China, and 17 in the Middle East -- this international monitoring system will improve our
ability to monitor nuclear explosions and catch cheaters. The United States already has

dozens of monitoring stations of its own; the CTBT will allow us to take advantage of
other countries' stations, while also creating new ones. The Treaty also will give us the
right to request on-site inspections of sites in other countries where nuclear tests are
suspected to have taken place.

As a matter of policy, the United States will maintain its moratorium on nuclear testing,
pending entry into force of the CTBT, and we are encouraging all other states to do the
same. We are also encouraging all states that have not signed and ratified the CTBT to
do so. Despite the unfortunate rejection of the CTBT by the U.S. Senate, we remain
committed to obtaining Senate advice and consent for ratification of this treaty. United
States ratification will encourage other states to ratify, enable the United States to lead
the international effort to gain CTBT entry into force, and strengthen international norms
against nuclear testing. Simply stated, the United States must be prepared to lead by
example.

The NPT, the cornerstone of international nuclear nonproliferation regime, reinforces
regional and global security by creating and sustaining confidence in the non-nuclear
commitments of its parties. It was an indispensable precondition for the denuclearization
of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus and South Africa. We seek to ensure that the NPT
remains a strong and vital element of global security by achieving universal adherence
and full compliance by its parties with their Treaty obligations. A Review Conference held
in May 2000, the first in fifteen years with a consensus document, strengthened the
global nuclear nonproliferation norm and demonstrated that support for this critical Treaty
is broad and deep. We won our case by vigorously promoting the value of the NPT in
preventing the spread of nuclear weapons while continuing policies designed to reduce
U.S. reliance on nuclear weapons and to work for their ultimate elimination.

The safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an essential
component of the nuclear nonproliferation regime. We seek widespread adoption of the
IAEA's strengthened safeguards system and to ensure that the IAEA has the resources
necessary to fulfill its obligations. We are working to amend the Convention on the
Physical Protection of Nuclear Material to ensure that its standards cover national
activities as well as international transfers of nuclear material, which complements our
effort to enhance IAEA safeguards. We also seek the immediate commencement of
negotiations to achieve a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty at the Geneva Conference on
Disarmament. Halting production of fissile materials for nuclear explosions would cap the
supply of nuclear materials available worldwide for weapons, a key step in halting the
spread of nuclear weapons. A coordinated effort by the intelligence community and law
enforcement agencies to detect, prevent, and deter illegal trafficking in fissile materials is
essential to our counterproliferation efforts. So is the Material Protection, Control and
Accounting program, which enhances security for former Soviet nuclear materials and
helps prevent them from ending up in the hands of terrorists or proliferant states. We also
recognize that nuclear weapon free zone treaties and protocols that conform with long-
standing U.S. criteria can also advance nuclear nonproliferation goals.

Through the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program and other
initiatives, we aim to strengthen controls over weapons-usable fissile material and
prevent the theft or diversion of NBC weapons and related material and technology from
the former Soviet Union. The CTR Program has effectively supported enhanced safety,
security, accounting, and centralized control measures for nuclear weapons and fissile
materials in the former Soviet Union. It has assisted Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus in
becoming non-nuclear weapons states and will continue to assist Russia in meeting its
START obligations. The CTR Program is also supporting measures to eliminate and
prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons and biological weapon-related capabilities,

and it has supported many ongoing military reductions and reform measures in the
former Soviet Union.

The Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund (NDF) is a sharply focused fund to permit
rapid response to unanticipated, high priority requirements or opportunities to: 1) halt the
spread of WMD, their delivery systems, and related technology; 2) limit the spread of
advanced conventional weapons and related technology; and 3) eliminate existing
weapons. NDF activities in Central Europe and the NIS have included the elimination of
SCUD and SS-23 missiles, the procurement of HEU, the development and deployment of
automated systems to license and track sensitive technologies, and the acquisition of
nuclear material detection equipment.

In 1999, the President launched the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative (ETRI). This
effort is designed to address the new security challenges in Russia and the other Newly
Independent States (NIS) caused by that year's financial crisis, including preventing the
proliferation of NBC weapons, reducing the threat posed by residual NBC weapons, and
stabilizing the military. This initiative builds on the success of existing programs, such as
the CTR program, the Material Protection, Control and Accounting program, and the
Science Centers. A new component of our nuclear security program will greatly enhance
the security of fissile material by concentrating it at fewer, well-protected sites, and new
programs will increase the security of facilities and experts formerly associated with the
Soviet Union's biological weapons effort.

At the June 4, 2000, Clinton-Putin summit, the United States and Russia reached
agreement on the management and disposition of plutonium designated as no longer
required for defense purposes. The agreement entered into force after Prime Minister
Kasyanov and Vice President Gore signed it on September 1, 2000. Under the
agreement, each government commits to irreversibly transform 34 metric tons of excess
weapon-grade plutonium to a form that will be unusable for weapons. The agreement
establishes the goals, timelines, and conditions for ensuring that this plutonium can never
again be used for weapons or any other military purposes.

Implementation of the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement is contingent
on sufficient international assistance for the Russian program. At the Okinawa G-8
Summit in July 2000, leaders took an additional step to this end. The final communiqué
stated that their goal for the next summit is to develop an international financing plan for
plutonium management and disposition based on a detailed project plan, and a
multilateral framework to coordinate this cooperation. They also committed to expand
cooperation to other interested countries beyond the G-8 in order to gain the widest
possible international support, and to explore the potential for both public and private
funding.

Over the past year, the United States Government provided leadership for the multilateral
cooperation effort, particularly in the context of an informal G-8 working group, which
coordinated with the G-8 Nonproliferation Experts Group. (NPEG). Preparations for the
Genoa summit will be under the auspices of a formally established Plutonium Disposition
Planning Group to be co-chaired by the United States and the Russian Federation. We
are purchasing tons of highly enriched uranium from dismantled Russian nuclear
weapons for conversion into commercial reactor fuel. We are helping redirect dozens of
former Soviet NBC facilities and tens of thousands of former NBC scientists in Eurasia
from military activities to beneficial civilian research.

In support of U.S. efforts to prevent proliferation of NBC expertise and materials in the
NIS, Eastern Europe, and across borders, the Departments of Defense, Energy, and
Commerce, the U.S. Customs Service, and the FBI are engaging in programs that assist

governments in developing effective export control systems and in developing capabilities
to prevent, deter, or detect such proliferation. These programs provide training,
equipment, advice, and services to law enforcement and border security agencies in
these countries.

We seek to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) with a new
international regime to enhance compliance. We are also working hard to implement and
enforce the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The United States Congress
underscored the importance of these efforts in October 1998 by passing implementing
legislation. In late 1999, the Executive Order (EO 13128), Presidential Decision Directive
(PDD-70), and two new regulations were completed, enabling the United States to submit
commercial declarations and commence commercial facility inspections in the middle of
2000.

The Administration also seeks to prevent destabilizing buildups of conventional arms and
to limit access to sensitive technical information, equipment, and technologies by
strengthening international regimes, including the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export
Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies, the Australia
Group (for chemical and biological weapons), the Missile Technology Control Regime,
the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), and the Zangger Committee (NSG and Zangger
ensure that IAEA safeguards are applied to nuclear exports). At the NATO 50th
Anniversary Summit, Allied leaders agreed to enhance NATO's ability to deal both
politically and militarily with the proliferation of WMD and the means of their delivery. To
this end, we have worked with our Alliance partners to establish the NATO WMD Center
and to promote invigorated discussions of nonproliferation issues in the NATO Senior
Political Military and Defense Groups on Proliferation.

Regional nonproliferation efforts are particularly important in three critical proliferation
zones: the Korean Peninsula, Southwest Asia, and South Asia. On the Korean Peninsula,
we are implementing the 1994 Agreed Framework, which requires full compliance by
North Korea to live up to its nuclear nonproliferation obligations. We also seek to
convince North Korea to halt its indigenous missile program and exports of missile
systems and technologies; something emphasized during a November 2000 visit to
Pyongyang by the Secretary of State. In the Middle East and Southwest Asia, we
encourage regional confidence-building measures and arms control agreements that
address the legitimate security concerns of all parties. We continue efforts to thwart and
roll back both Iran's development of NBC weapons and long-range missiles, and also
Iraq's efforts to reconstitute its NBC programs. In South Asia, we seek to persuade India
and Pakistan to refrain from weaponizing or deploying nuclear weapons, testing or
deploying missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and further producing fissile
material for nuclear weapons. We also urge India and Pakistan to adhere fully to
international nonproliferation standards and to sign and ratify the CTBT.

Over the past three years, the United States has worked to ensure that the landmark
1990 Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty remains a cornerstone of
European peace, security and stability into the 21st century. On November 19, 1999, we
joined the other 29 CFE States Parties in signing an Adaptation Agreement that
eliminates obsolete bloc-to-bloc limits and replaces them with a system of national and
territorial ceilings. It will also enhance transparency through more information and
inspections, strengthen requirements for host nation consent to the presence of foreign
forces, and open the treaty to accession by other European nations. The accompanying
CFE Final Act reflects a number of important political commitments, including
agreements on the complete withdrawal of Russian armed forces from Moldova and
partial withdrawal of Russian forces from Georgia.

The United States is a world leader in the effort to curb the harmful proliferation and
destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons (SA/LW) such as automatic
rifles, machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, light mortars and man-portable anti-
aircraft missiles. Inexpensive, widely available, and easy to use, these weapons
exacerbate regional conflicts, expand casualties, increase crime, and hinder economic
development. They can jeopardize the safety of peacekeepers, potentially putting U.S.
Forces at risk.

To reduce this threat, the United States is urging countries to adopt effective export
controls, brokering regulations, permanent marking, anti-smuggling measures, and
embargo enforcement. Global efforts focus on securing a Firearms Protocol to the UN
Transnational Organized Crime Convention and seeking international agreement through
the UN 2001 Conference on Illicit Trafficking in SA/LW. The United States also works
with regional partners in the OSCE, NATO/EAPC, OAS, OAU, the ASEAN Regional
Forum, and elsewhere. The United States provides some technical assistance to
countries trying to prevent SA/LW trafficking and actively supports efforts to destroy
excess stocks of SA/LW worldwide, often partnering with like-minded countries such as
Norway.

The United States is also committed to ending the threat to innocent civilians from anti-
personnel landmines (APLs). We have already taken major steps toward this goal while
ensuring our ability to meet international obligations and provide for the safety and
security of our men and women in uniform. President Clinton has directed the Defense
Department to end the use of all APLs, including self-destructing APLs, outside Korea by
2003 and to pursue aggressively the objective of having APL alternatives ready for Korea
by 2006. We are also aggressively pursuing alternatives to our mixed anti-tank systems
that contain anti-personnel submunitions. We have made clear that the United States will
sign the Ottawa Convention by 2006 if by then we have succeeded in identifying and
fielding suitable alternatives to our self-destructing APLs and mixed anti-tank systems.

In May 1999, we gained Senate advice and consent to ratification of the Amended Mines
Protocol to the Convention on Conventional Weapons. This agreement addresses the
worldwide humanitarian problem caused by APLs by banning the use of non-detectable
APLs and severely limiting the use of long-duration APLs to clearly marked and
monitored fields that effectively keep out civilians. We have established a permanent ban
on APL exports and are seeking to universalize an export ban through the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva. We are supporting humanitarian demining programs worldwide
through engagement with mine-afflicted nations and the international community. We
have taken a lead role in establishing the International Test and Evaluation Program,
through which nations will develop agreed standards and test procedures for various
pieces of demining equipment and will then test against those standards. To date, the
United States has provided over $400 million through the

U.S. Humanitarian Demining Program. The Demining 2010 Initiative, which is
independent of the Humanitarian Demining Program, advocates increased efforts in the
United States and abroad and develops public-private partnerships to support these
programs.

The effectiveness of the panoply of arms control agreements described above, as well as
that of our nonproliferation activities, rests on maintaining and enhancing our monitoring
capabilities. We must keep ahead of potential attempts by others at denial and deception.
To do so, we must maintain current monitoring assets and have a vigorous research and
development program that will translate new technologies into enhanced capabilities.
These efforts will increase our confidence in the viability of existing agreements and
enable us to conclude new ones to further decrease the risks of armed conflicts.

Military Activities

The U.S. military is a very visible and critical pillar of our effort to shape the international
security environment in ways that protect and promote U.S. interests. It is not, however, a
substitute for other forms of engagement, such as diplomatic, economic, scientific,
technological, cultural, and educational activities. We must always be mindful that the
primary mission of our Armed Forces is to deter and, if necessary, to fight and win
conflicts in which our vital interests are threatened. Through overseas presence and
peacetime engagement activities, such as defense cooperation, security assistance,
regional centers for security studies, training, and exercises with allies and friends, our
Armed Forces help to deter aggression and coercion, build coalitions, promote regional
stability, support the development of indigenous counterdrug law enforcement
capabilities, and serve as role models for militaries in emerging democracies. With
countries that are neither staunch friends nor known foes, military cooperation can serve
as a positive means of building bridges between the military leaderships of different
nations. These links enhance security relationships between the nations today and will
contribute to improved relations tomorrow. At the same time, we also remain firmly
committed to human rights and we will ensure our military forces do not knowingly train or
assist units that have committed a gross violation of human rights.

Maintaining our overseas presence enhances our understanding of the military
developments within various regions of the world. Relevant observations add to our
larger geo-political understanding of potential areas for instability or threats to our
national interests and help select our optimal avenue of response; diplomatic, economic,
or military. It reassures our allies and promotes regional stability. It gives substance to
our security commitments, helps prevent the development of power vacuums and
instability, and contributes to deterrence by demonstrating our determination to defend
U.S., allied, and friendly interests in critical regions. Having credible combat forces
forward deployed in peacetime also better positions the United States to respond rapidly
to crises, permitting them to be first on the scene. Equally essential is effective global
power projection, which is key to the flexibility demanded of our forces and provides
options for responding to potential crises and conflicts even when we have no permanent
presence or a limited infrastructure in a region.

Just as U.S. engagement overall must be selective -- focusing on the threats and
opportunities most relevant to our interests and applying our resources where we can
make the greatest difference -- so too must our use of the Armed Forces for engagement
be equally discerning. Engagement activities must be carefully managed to prevent
erosion of our military's current and long-term readiness for larger-scale contingencies.
The Defense Department's theater engagement planning process, which was approved
by the President in 1997, helps ensure that military engagement activities are prioritized
within theaters, and balanced against available resources. In short, we must prioritize
military engagement activities to ensure the readiness of our Armed Forces to carry out
crisis response and warfighting missions, as well as to ensure that we can sustain an
appropriate level of engagement activities over the long term.

Our ability to deter potential adversaries in peacetime rests on several factors,
particularly on our demonstrated will and ability to uphold our security commitments when
they are challenged. We have earned this reputation through both our declaratory policy,
which clearly communicates costs to potential adversaries, and our credible warfighting
capability across the full spectrum of conflict. This capability is embodied in four ways;
ready forces and equipment strategically stationed or deployed forward, forces in the
United States at the appropriate level of readiness to deploy when needed, our ability to
maintain access to critical regions and infrastructure overseas, and our demonstrated
ability to form and lead effective military coalitions.

We must continue to improve our program to combat terrorism in the areas of
antiterrorism, counterterrorism, consequence management, and intelligence support to
deter terrorism. We will deter terrorism through the increased antiterrorism readiness of
our installations and forward forces, enhanced training and awareness of military
personnel, and the development of comprehensive theater engagement plans. In
counterterrorism, because terrorist organizations may not be deterred by traditional
means, we must ensure a robust capability to accurately attribute the source of attacks
against the United States or its citizens, and to respond effectively and decisively to
protect our national interests. U.S. armed forces possess a tailored range of options to
respond to terrorism directed at U.S. citizens, interests, and property. In the event of a
terrorist incident, our consequence management ability to significantly mitigate injury and
damage may likely deter future attacks. Finally, we will continue to improve the timeliness
and accuracy of intelligence support to commanders, which will also enhance our ability
to deter terrorism.

Our nuclear deterrent posture is one example of how U.S. military capabilities are used
effectively to deter aggression and coercion against U.S. interests. Nuclear weapons
serve as a guarantor of our security commitments to allies and a disincentive to those
who would contemplate developing or otherwise acquiring their own WMD capability.
Those who threaten the United States or its allies with WMD should have no doubt that
any such attack would meet an overwhelming and devastating response. Our military
planning for the possible employment of U.S. strategic nuclear weapons is focused on
deterring a nuclear war and it emphasizes the survivability of our nuclear systems,
infrastructure, and command, control, and communications systems necessary to endure
a preemptive attack yet still deliver an overwhelming response. Another key element of
the U.S. nuclear deterrent strategy is ensuring the National Command Authorities have a
survivable and endurable command, control, and communications capability through
which to execute the mission and direct nuclear forces during all phases of a nuclear war.
The United States will continue to maintain a robust triad of strategic nuclear forces
sufficient to deter any potential adversaries who may have or seek access to nuclear
forces -- to convince them that seeking a nuclear advantage or resorting to nuclear
weapons would be futile. In addition, some U.S. non-strategic nuclear forces are forward
deployed in NATO to demonstrate the political commitment of the United States to the
long-term viability of NATO and European security. We must also ensure the continued
viability of the infrastructure that supports U.S. nuclear forces and weapons. The
Stockpile Stewardship Program will provide high confidence in the safety and reliability of
our nuclear weapons under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

The Department of Defense's Counterproliferation Initiative provides another example of
how U.S. military capabilities are used effectively to deter aggression and coercion
against U.S. interests. Under this initiative, we are preparing our own forces and working
with allies to ensure that we can prevail on the battlefield despite the threatened or actual
use of NBC weapons by adversaries.

The United States is committed to preserving internationally recognized freedom of
navigation on -- and overflight of -- the world's oceans, which are critical to the future
strength of our nation and the maintenance of global stability. Freedom of navigation and
overflight are essential to our economic security and for the worldwide movement and
sustainment of U.S. military forces. These freedoms are codified in the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea, which the President submitted to the Senate in 1994
for advice and consent to ratification. In addition to lending the certainty of the rule of law
to an area critical to our national security, the Convention preserves our leadership in
global ocean policy. Thus, the Law of the Sea Convention buttresses the strategic
advantages that the United States gains from being a global power, and ratification of the
Convention remains a high priority.

Quality people -- civilian and military -- are our most critical asset in implementing our
defense activities. The quality of our men and women in uniform will be the deciding
factor in future military operations where the operation and maintenance of information
systems and advanced technology become ever more important. We must ensure that
we remain the most fully prepared and best trained military force in the world.
Accordingly, we will continue to place the highest priority and bear the costs associated
with programs that support recruiting, retention, quality of life, training, equipping and
educating our personnel.

International Law Enforcement Cooperation

Certain criminal threats to our national security are international in nature. Transnational
threats include terrorism, drug and migrant smuggling, and other international crime. The
rise in the frequency and intensity of these threats makes it incumbent upon U.S. and
foreign law enforcement and judicial authorities to cooperate in an innovative manner.
The President's International Crime Control Strategy prescribes the role of overseas law
enforcement presence in establishing and sustaining working relationships with foreign
law enforcement agencies; keeping crime away from our shores; enabling extradition;
and solving serious U.S. crimes.

The Department of State and U.S. federal law enforcement agencies continue to assist
law enforcement agencies in Central and Eastern Europe and East Asia through
cooperative centers established in Hungary and Thailand known as the International Law
Enforcement Academies (ILEAs). The ILEA initiative is a multinational effort organized by
the United States, the host nations, and other international training partners to provide
mutual assistance and law enforcement training.

Environmental and Health Initiatives

The President has said, ""Our natural security must be seen as part of our national
security."" Decisions today regarding the environment and natural resources can affect
our security for generations. Environmental threats do not heed national borders;
environmental perils overseas and environmental crime pose long-term dangers to U.S.
security and well being. Natural resource scarcities can trigger and exacerbate conflict,
and phenomena such as climate change, toxic pollution, ocean dumping, and ozone
depletion directly threaten the health and well-being of Americans and all other
individuals on Earth.

Responding firmly to environmental threats remains a part of mainstream American
foreign policy. America's leadership was essential for agreement on the Kyoto Protocol --
the first binding agreement among the world's industrialized nations to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. America also brokered key international agreements on toxic
chemicals -- such as persistent organic pollutants, environmental aspects of
biotechnology, the ozone layer, and endangered marine life. America's insistence on high
environmental standards in its own trade agreements, in international financial
institutions, and in bilateral export credit and development assistance programs similarly
demonstrates to the rest of the international community that growing economies and
clean environments do go hand-in-hand. America also provided leadership in the Global
Environment Facility and in bilateral programs for clean energy development, as well as
conservation of biological diversity and endangered ecosystems such as tropical forests.

With globalization, the free flow of people and goods across national borders continues to
increase rapidly with each passing year. This interdependence has caused diseases and
health risks around the world to become matters of both U.S. national and international

security. The United States promotes international cooperation on health issues because
it reduces the threat of diseases to Americans, and because global international
economic development, democratization, and political stability are predicated in part on
the health of populations worldwide.

Beyond these general concerns, a number of specific international health issues are
critical for our national security. Because a growing proportion of our national food supply
is coming from international sources, assuring the safety of the food we consume must
be a priority. The Administration has announced new and stronger programs to ensure
the safety of imported as well as domestic foods, to be overseen by the President's
Council on Food Safety. New and emerging infections such as drug-resistant tuberculosis
and the Ebola virus can move with the speed of jet travel. We are actively engaged with
the international health community as well as the World Health Organization to stop the
spread of these dangerous diseases.

Combating the global epidemic of HIV/AIDS has been a top international health priority in
recent years. AIDS is now the number one cause of death on the continent of Africa. The
United States led the United Nations Security Council in holding its first-ever session on
AIDS in Africa and has committed to efforts to accelerate the development and delivery of
vaccines for AIDS and other diseases that disproportionately affect the developing world.
We also have promoted efforts by African national governments to provide AIDS
awareness education to their military members who travel widely around the continent;
and led the G-8's decision to link debt relief to HIV/AIDS prevention and other such
programs.

Population issues have also been a health priority garnering renewed focus
internationally. The Administration has re-established U.S. leadership on international
population issues by expanding quality reproductive health care. This includes voluntary
family planning services for women and men around the world; improving the political,
economic, and social status of women; and enhancing educational opportunities for
women and girls.

Responding to Threats and Crises

Because our efforts to shape the international environment alone cannot guarantee the
security we seek, the United States must be able to respond at home and abroad to the
full spectrum of threats and crises that may arise. Since our resources are finite, we must
be selective in our responses, focusing on challenges that most directly affect our
interests and engaging when and where we can have the greatest positive impact. We
must use the most appropriate tool or combination of tools -- diplomacy, public
diplomacy, economic measures, law enforcement, intelligence, military operations, and
others. We act in alliance or partnership when others share our interests, but will act
unilaterally when compelling national interests so demand.

Efforts to deter an adversary -- be it an aggressor nation, terrorist group or criminal
organization -- can become the leading edge of crisis response. In this sense, deterrence
straddles the line between shaping the international environment and responding to
crises. Deterrence in crisis generally involves demonstrating the United States’
commitment to a particular country or interest by enhancing our warfighting capability in
the theater. Our forward and rotationally deployed forces are the embodiment of our
continuous commitment to our overseas partners and act as the first line of deterrence,
providing the necessary inroads to access and influence to help defuse crisis situations.

Our ability to respond to the full spectrum of threats requires that we have the best-
trained, best-equipped, most effective armed forces in the world. Our strategy requires
that we have highly capable ground, air, naval, special operations, and space forces
supported by a range of enabling capabilities including strategic mobility and Command,
Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
(C41SR). Maintaining our superior forces requires developing superior technology, and
exploiting it to the fullest extent.

Strategic mobility is critical to our ability to augment forces already present in the region
with the projection of additional forces for both domestic and international crisis response.
This agility in response is key to successful American leadership and engagement.
Access to sufficient fleets of aircraft, ships, vehicles, and trains, as well as bases, ports,
pre-positioned equipment, and other infrastructure will of course be an imperative if we
are to deploy and sustain U.S. and multinational forces in regions of interest to us.

We are committed to maintaining U.S. preeminence in space. Unimpeded access to and
use of space is a vital national interest -- essential for protecting U.S. national security,
promoting our prosperity, and ensuring our well-being. Consistent with our international
obligations, we will deter threats to our interests in space, counter hostile efforts against
U.S. access to and use of space, and maintain the ability to counter space systems and
services that could be used for hostile purposes against our military forces, command
and control systems, or other critical capabilities. We will maintain our technological
superiority in space systems, and sustain a robust U.S. space industry and a strong,
forward-looking research base. We also will continue efforts to prevent the spread of
weapons of mass destruction to space, and will continue to pursue global partnerships
addressing space-related scientific, economic, environmental, and security issues.

We also are committed to maintaining information superiority -- the capability to collect,
process, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information while exploiting and/or
denying an adversary's ability to do the same. Operational readiness, as well as the
command and control of forces, relies increasingly on information systems and
technology. We must keep pace with rapidly evolving information technology so that we
can cultivate and harvest the promise of the knowledge that comes from this information
superiority, sharing that knowledge among U.S. forces and coalition partners while
exploiting the shortfalls in our adversaries’ information capabilities.

Protecting the Homeland

Emerging threats to our homeland by both state and non-state actors may be more likely
in the future as our potential adversaries strike against vulnerable civilian targets in the
United States to avoid direct confrontation with our military forces. Such acts represent a
new dimension of asymmetric threats to our national security. Easier access to the critical
technical expertise and technologies enables both state and non-state actors to harness
increasingly destructive power with greater ease. In response to such threats, the United
States has embarked on a comprehensive strategy to prevent, deter, disrupt, and when
necessary, effectively respond to the myriad of threats to our homeland that we will face.

National Missile Defense

The Clinton Administration is committed to the development of a limited National Missile
Defense (NMD) system designed to counter the emerging ballistic missile threat from
states that threaten international peace and security. On September 1, 2000, the
President announced that while the technology for NMD was promising, the system as a
whole is not yet proven, and thus he was not prepared to proceed with the deployment of

a limited NMD system. The President has instead asked the Secretary of Defense to
continue a robust program of development and testing. The Administration recognizes
the relationship among the ABM Treaty, strategic stability, and the START process, and
is committed to working with Russia on any modifications to the ABM Treaty required to
deploy a limited NMD. An NMD system, if deployed, would be part of a larger strategy to
preserve and enhance peace and security.

In making this decision, the President considered the threat, cost, technical feasibility and
impact overall on our national security of proceeding with NMD, including the impact on
arms control and relations with Russia, China, and our allies. He considered a thorough
technical review by the Department of Defense as well as the advice of his top national
security advisors.

The Pentagon has made progress on developing a system that can address the
emerging missile threat. But, at this time, we do not have sufficient information to
conclude that it can work reliably under realistic conditions. Critical elements of the
program, such as the booster rocket for the missile interceptor, have not been tested; and
there are also questions to be resolved about the ability of the system to deal with
countermeasures. The President made clear that we should not move forward until we
have further confidence that the system will work and until we have made every
reasonable diplomatic effort to minimize the international consequences. In the interim,
the Pentagon will continue the development and testing of the NMD system. That effort is
still at an early stage: three of the nineteen, planned intercept tests have been held so
far. Additional ground tests and simulations will also take place.

The development of our NMD is part of the Administration's comprehensive national
security strategy to prevent potential adversaries from acquiring and/or threatening the
United States with such weapons. Arms control agreements with Russia are an important
part of this strategy because they ensure stability and predictability between the United
States and Russia, promote the dismantling of nuclear weapons, and help complete the
transition from confrontation to cooperation with Russia. The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
(ABM) Treaty limits anti-missile defenses according to the following principle: neither side
should deploy defenses that would undermine the other's nuclear deterrent, and thus
tempt the other to strike first in a crisis or take countermeasures that would make both
our countries less secure. The President's decision not to deploy a limited NMD system
will provide additional time to pursue with Russia the goal of adapting the ABM Treaty to
permit the deployment of a limited NMD that would not undermine strategic stability. The
United States will also continue to consult with allies and hold dialogues with other states.

In August 1999, President Clinton decided that the initial NMD architecture would include:
100 ground-based interceptors deployed in Alaska, one ABM radar in Alaska, and five
upgraded early warning radar. This approach is the fastest, most affordable, and most
technologically mature approach to fielding an NMD system capable of protecting all 50
states against projected emerging threats.

On July 23, 1999, President Clinton signed H.R. 4, the ""National Missile Defense Act of
1999,"" stating that it is the policy of the United States to deploy an effective NMD system
as soon as technologically possible. The legislation includes two amendments supported
by the Administration. The first makes clear that any NMD deployment must be subject to
the authorization and appropriations process, and thus that no decision on deployment
has been made. The second amendment states that it is the policy of the United States to
seek continued negotiated reductions in Russian nuclear forces, putting Congress on
record as continuing to support negotiated reductions in strategic nuclear arms,
reaffirming the Administration's position that missile defense policy must take into
account important arms control and nuclear nonproliferation objectives.

Countering Foreign Intelligence Collection

The United States is a primary target of foreign intelligence services due to our military,
scientific, technological and economic preeminence. Foreign intelligence services
aggressively seek information about U.S. political and military intentions and capabilities.
As the rapidity of global technological change accelerates and the gap with some nations
has widened, these countries’ foreign intelligence agencies are stepping up their efforts
to collect classified or sensitive information on U.S. weapons systems, U.S. intelligence
collection methods, emerging technologies with military applications, and related
technical methods. Such information enables potential adversaries to counter U.S.
political and military objectives, develop sophisticated weapons more quickly and
efficiently, and develop countermeasures against U.S. weapons and related technical
methods. Intelligence collection against U.S. economic, commercial, and proprietary
information enables foreign states and corporations to obtain shortcuts to industrial
development and improve their competitiveness against U.S. corporations in global
markets. Although difficult to quantify, economic and industrial espionage results in the
loss of millions of dollars and thousands of jobs annually.

To protect sensitive national security information, it is critical for us to effectively counter
the collection efforts of foreign intelligence services and non-state actors through
vigorous counterintelligence efforts and security programs. Over the last six years, we
have created new counterintelligence mechanisms to address economic and industrial
espionage and have implemented procedures to improve coordination among
intelligence, counterintelligence and law enforcement agencies. These measures have
considerably strengthened our ability to counter the foreign intelligence collection threat.
We will continue to refine and enhance our counterintelligence capabilities as we enter
the 21st century.

Dramatic geopolitical changes that continue into the first decade of the 21 s' century
increase rather than lessen the need to protect sensitive national security information.
Some of this information is classified while some is unclassified but sensitive due to its
relationship to, or impact upon, our critical infrastructure. Increased threats to our cyber
security and the inadvertent or deliberate disclosure of sensitive information underscore
the necessity for the National Security Community to have reliable, timely, and trusted
information available to those who both need it and are authorized to have it. During the
last five years we have established a set of security countermeasures policies, practices,
procedures, and programs for a rational, fair, forward looking, and cost-effective security
system. More needs to be done, however, and efforts will continue in providing a better
synchronized, integrated and interoperable programs for personnel security, physical
security, technical security, operational security, education and awareness, information
assurance, classification management, industrial security, and counterintelligence.

Combating Terrorism

The United States has mounted an aggressive response to terrorism. Our strategy
pressures terrorists, deters attacks, and responds forcefully to terrorist acts. It combines
enhanced law enforcement and intelligence efforts; vigorous diplomacy and economic
sanctions; and, when necessary, military force. Domestically, we seek to stop terrorists
before they act, and eliminate their support networks and financing. Overseas, we seek
to eliminate terrorist sanctuaries; counter state and non-governmental support for
terrorism; help other governments improve their physical and political counterterrorism,
antiterrorism, and consequence management efforts; tighten embassy and military facility
security; and protect U.S. citizens living and traveling abroad. Whether at home or
abroad, we will respond to terrorism through defensive readiness of our facilities and

personnel, and the ability of our terrorism consequence management efforts to mitigate
injury and damage.

Our strategy requires us to both prevent and, if necessary, respond to terrorism.
Prevention -- which includes intelligence collection, breaking up cells, and limiting the
movement, planning, and organization of terrorists -- entails more unknowns and its
effectiveness will never be fully proven or appreciated, but it is certainly the preferable
path. For example, as a result of the quiet cooperation with some of our allies and among
federal authorities, agencies, and local law enforcement, planned terrorist attacks within
the United States and against U.S. interests abroad during the millennium celebration
were thwarted. A major aspect of our prevention efforts is bolstering the political will and
security capabilities of those states that are on the front lines to terrorist threats and that
are disproportionately impacted by the expanding threat. This coalition of nations is
imperative to the international effort to contain and fight the terrorism that threatens
American interests.

Avenues of international trade provide a highway for the tools and weapons of
international terrorists. The same sophisticated transportation network that can efficiently,
safely, and reliably move people and goods is also equally attractive to those whose
motives may be hostile, dangerous, or criminal. Systems that promote efficiency, volume
and speed, fueling economic prosperity, create new challenges in the balance between
policing and facilitating the transnational movements of people and goods. Globalization
and electronic commerce transcend conventional borders, fast rendering traditional
border security measures at air, land, and sea ports of entry ineffective or obsolete.
Despite the challenges, we are developing tools to close off this avenue for terrorists. In
this new environment, prudent, reasonable, and affordable security measures will require
an approach transcending any particular transportation node or sector. The International
Trade Data System (ITDS), already in initial implementation pilot testing, was created to
foster an integrated system to electronically collect, use, and disseminate international
trade and transportation data. By transcending transportation nodes and sectors, efforts
like the ITDS project will foreclose opportunities terrorists may believe are emerging with
globalization.

When terrorism occurs, despite our best efforts, we can neither forget the crime nor ever
give up on bringing its perpetrators to justice. We make no concessions to terrorists.
Since 1993, a dozen terrorist fugitives have been apprehended overseas and rendered,
formally or informally, to the United States to answer for their crimes. These include the
perpetrators of the World Trade Center bombing, the attack outside CIA headquarters,
and an attack on a Pan Am flight more than 18 years ago. In 1998, the U.S. Armed
Forces carried out strikes against a chemical weapons target and an active terrorist base
operated by Usama bin Ladin, whose terror network had carried out bombings of
American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam and planned still other attacks
against Americans. We will likewise pursue the criminals responsible for the attack on the
USS Cole in Yemen.

Whenever possible, we use law enforcement, diplomatic, and economic tools to wage the
fight against terrorism. But there have been, and will be, times when those tools are not
enough. As long as terrorists continue to target American citizens, we reserve the right to
act in self-defense by striking at their bases and those who sponsor, assist, or actively
support them, as we have done over the years in different countries.

Fighting terrorism requires a substantial commitment of financial, human, and political
resources. Since 1993, both the FBI's counterterrorism budget and the number of FBI
agents assigned to counterterrorism have more than doubled. The President has also
created and filled the post of National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection,

and Counterterrorism. Three presidential directives now coordinate the efforts of senior
counterterrorism personnel from various government agencies in dealing with WMD and
other threats at home. The FBI and the State Department, respectively, operate Rapid
Deployment Teams and interagency Foreign Emergency Support Teams to deploy
quickly to scenes of terrorist incidents worldwide.

However, it is not only the response capabilities that need significant resources. It is our
preventive efforts, such as active diplomatic and military engagement, political pressure,
economic sanctions, and bolstering allies’ political and security capabilities, that also
require strong financial support in order to squeeze terrorists before they act. Providing
political support and economic assistance to front line states and other allies impacted by
this threat expands the circle of nations fighting against threats to the United States.
These preventive measures are an important partner to our counterterrorism response
efforts.

We must continue to devote the necessary resources for America's strategy to combat
terrorism, which integrates preventive and responsive measures and encompasses a
graduated scale of enhanced law enforcement and intelligence gathering, vigorous
diplomacy, and, where needed, military action.

Domestic Preparedness Against Weapons of Mass Destruction

Defending the United States against weapons of mass destruction is a top national
security priority. In October 1998, the President signed into law legislation criminalizing
the unjustified accumulation of dangerous chemicals, thereby enhancing the ability of law
enforcement to prevent potentially catastrophic terrorist acts by allowing enforcement
action before the chemicals are weaponized. Additionally, concerted efforts have been
undertaken to mitigate the consequences of a WMD attack.

The Federal Government, in coordination with state and local authorities, will respond
rapidly and decisively to any terrorist incident in the United States involving WMD.
Increased preparedness at home is critical to defending against, and responding to, such
unconventional threats. The Administration developed a Five-Year Interagency
Counterterrorism and Technology Crime Plan to address these issues.

Established in 1998, a standing Weapons of Mass Destruction Preparedness Interagency
Working Group, chaired by the National Coordinator, addresses current and future
requirements of local, state, and federal authorities that are directly responsible for the
WMD crisis and consequence management efforts. In coordinating the interagency
process and cooperation between these three levels of government, several initiatives
are now in place to better prepare the United States against a WMD incident. These
initiatives include equipping and training first responders in the 157 largest metropolitan
areas across the nation to prepare for, and defend against, chemical, biological, or
nuclear weapons of mass destruction attacks; renovating the public health surveillance
system; and establishing civilian medical stockpiles of vaccines and antibiotics.

Critical Infrastructure Protection

An extraordinarily sophisticated information technology (IT) infrastructure fuels America's
economy and national security. Critical infrastructures, including telecommunications,
energy, finance, transportation, water, and emergency services, form a bedrock upon
which the success of all our endeavors -- economic, social, and military -- depend. These
infrastructures are highly interconnected, both physically and by the manner in which they
rely upon information technology and the national information infrastructure. This trend

toward increasing interdependence has accelerated in recent years with the advent of the
Information Age.

At the same time that the IT revolution has led to substantially more interconnected
infrastructures with generally greater centralized control, the advent of ""just in time""
business practices has reduced margins for error for infrastructure owners and operators.
In addition, the trend toward deregulation and growth of competition in key infrastructures
has understandably eroded the willingness of owners and operators to pay for spare
capacity that traditionally served a useful ""shock absorber' role in cushioning key
infrastructures from failures. Finally, the increase in the number of mergers among
infrastructure providers has increased the pressure for further reductions in spare
capacity as managers seek to reduce overhead and wring ""excess"" costs out of merged
companies.

As with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, ongoing hostile hacker attacks, and cyber
conflicts between China and Taiwan have shown, asymmetric warfare against the United
States will likely grow. We must understand the vulnerabilities and interdependencies of
our infrastructures, accept that such attacks know no international boundaries, and work
to mitigate potential problems.

In January 2000, the President launched the National Plan for Information Systems
Protection and announced new budget proposals for critical infrastructure protection.
Specific new proposals included the Federal Cyber Systems Training and Education
program to offer IT education in exchange for federal service; an intrusion detection
network for the Department of Defense and for federal civilian agencies; and the Institute
for Information Infrastructure Protection, an innovative public/private partnership to fill key
gaps in critical infrastructure protection R&D. The Institute represented part of a 32%
increase that were proposed for computer security research and development efforts for
the FY 2001 budget.

Implementing the proposals of the National Plan, as well as other future projects, will
contribute to our economic competitiveness, military strength, and general public health
and safety. These proposals will also protect the ability of state and local governments to
maintain order and deliver minimum essential public services while also working with the
private sector to ensure the orderly functioning of the economy and the delivery of vital
services.

The National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), founded in 1998 under Presidential
Decision Directive 63, is the national focal point for warning, analysis, and response
regarding threats to the infrastructures. Over the past two years it has provided warnings
to the private sector, federal, state, and local governments regarding infrastructure
threats. It has also coordinated numerous investigations of destructive computer viruses,
computer intrusions against United States Government and private IT systems, and
denial of service attacks both in the United States and overseas.

Some aspects of our critical infrastructure, such as the various transportation systems,
are not commonly associated with the trends of globalization and technological change,
but nonetheless are being dramatically affected by them. For example, the Marine
Transportation System, which consists of waterways, ports, and their intermodal
connections, vessels, vehicles and system users, provides American businesses with
critical competitive access to suppliers and markets that will be key to maintaining our
nation's role as a global power. Threats to this and other transportation systems will drive
new security imperatives that we must continue to balance with the need for speed and
efficiency. In any case, ensuring the long-term health of these traditional aspects of our

critical infrastructure must remain a priority even as we look to new technologies to
improve other aspects of our infrastructures and provide other competitive advantages.

Most importantly, the Federal Government cannot protect critical infrastructures alone.
The private sector owns and operates the vast majority of these infrastructures.
Protecting critical infrastructure, therefore, requires the Federal Government to build
partnerships with the private sector in all areas -- from business and higher education, to
law enforcement, to R&D. The Secretary of Commerce and industry leaders -- mostly
from Fortune 500 companies -- are leading the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure
Security. The Attorney General has teamed up with the Information Technology
Association of America to promote industry-government cooperation against cyber crime
through the Cyber Citizen project. The NIPC, meanwhile, is establishing cooperative
relationships between industry and law enforcement through its InfraGard initiative.

Some segments of our critical infrastructures have not historically devoted significant
resources to protection from threats other than those caused by natural means. As a
result, we are building a strong foundation for continued protection of our critical
infrastructures. The public and private sectors must work together to conduct R&D in
infrastructure protection and interdependencies, increase investment in training and
educating cyber-security practitioners (to include building an adequate base of
researchers in this new discipline), and find innovative technical, policy, and legal
solutions that protect our infrastructures and preserve our civil rights.

National Security Emergency Preparedness

U.S. Continuity of Government and Continuity of Operations programs remain a top
national security priority into the 21st century. They preserve the capability to govern,
lead, and perform essential functions and services to meet essential defense and civilian
needs. Together with other security, critical infrastructure protection, and counterterrorism
programs, Continuity of Government and Continuity of Operations programs remain an
important hedge against current and emerging threats, and future uncertainties.

We will do all we can to deter and prevent destructive and threatening forces such as
terrorism, NBC weapons use, disruption of our critical infrastructures, and regional or
state-centered threats from endangering our citizens. But if an emergency occurs, we
must be prepared to respond effectively at home and abroad to protect lives and
property, mobilize the personnel, resources, and capabilities necessary to effectively
handle the emergency, and ensure the survival of our institutions and infrastructures. To
this end, comprehensive, all-hazard emergency planning by Federal departments,
agencies and the military, as well as a strong and responsive industrial and technology
base, will be maintained as crucial national security emergency preparedness
requirements.

Fighting Drug Trafficking and Other International Crime

Broad ranges of criminal activities that originate overseas threaten the safety and well
being of the American people.

Drug Trafficking. Drug use and its damaging consequences cost our society over $110
billion per year and poison the schools and neighborhoods where our youth learn and
play. Aggressive law enforcement is dramatically weakening the domestic perpetrators of
organized crime who have controlled America's drug trade for much of the past century.
Today, international drug syndicates based abroad challenge us. The criminals who run
the international drug trade continue to diversify and seek new markets in the United

States -- moving beyond large cities into smaller communities and even rural towns. All
Americans, regardless of economic, geographic, or other position in society, feel the
effects of drug use.

The National Drug Control Strategy, both at home and abroad, integrates prevention and
treatment with law enforcement and interdiction efforts. We aim to cut illegal drug use
and availability in the United States by 50% by 2007, and reduce the health and social
consequences of drug use and trafficking by 25% over the same period.

Domestically, we have engaged in a wide range of treatment and prevention efforts. We
seek to educate and enable our youth to reject illegal drugs, increase the safety of U.S.
citizens by substantially reducing drug-related crime and violence; reduce health and
social costs to the public of illegal drug use; reduce domestic cultivation of cannabis and
production of methamphetamines and other synthetic drugs; and shield America's air,
land, and sea frontiers from the drug threat.

The Drug-Free Community Support program and the Drug-Free Schools and
Communities program promote citizen participation in anti-drug efforts and help to
provide drug-free learning environments for our children. The Office of National Drug
Control Policy is leading the implementation of a $2 billion, multi-year, science-based,
national media campaign on the consequences of youth drug use. In the law enforcement
arena, we have assisted communities in their law enforcement efforts; are committed to
stemming the flow of drugs into our country; and have enhanced coordination among
Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to arrest and prosecute drug
traffickers and abusers. Concerted efforts by the public, all levels of government, and the
private sector, together with other governments, private groups, and international
organizations will be required for our strategy to succeed.

Internationally, our strategy recognizes that the most effective counterdrug operations are
mounted at the source where illegal drugs are grown and produced. Our efforts therefore
center on supply reduction in major drug exporting countries. In these ""source nations,”
we act to bolster the capabilities of governments to help them reduce cultivation by
eradicating drug crops, develop alternative crops, destroy drug labs, and control
chemicals used in illegal drug production. As a second line of defense, in the transit zone
between source regions and the U.S. border, we detect, monitor, and communicate with
partner nations on the movement of suspicious surface, sea, and air traffic outside the
United States. We support interdiction programs to halt the shipment of illicit drugs. In
concert with allies abroad, we pursue prosecution of major drug traffickers, dismantling
drug trafficking organizations, prevention of money laundering, and elimination of criminal
financial support networks.

In an example of such cooperative effort, the United States is providing $1.3 billion in
support for Plan Colombia, President Andres Pastrana's effort to fight Colombian drug
trafficking and strengthen democracy, as well as promote legitimate economic endeavors
in Colombia. Since Colombian drug traffickers supply approximately 90% of the cocaine
used in the United States, U.S. assistance to Plan Colombia's interdiction, eradication,
and alternative crop development efforts will be necessary if we are to stem this deadly
drug's flow into the United States. As an additional measure, we continue to strongly
support interdiction programs to halt the flow of drugs across the U.S. border either by
independent means or exploiting the U.S. transportation system.

Other International Crime. Economic globalization increasingly makes all nations and

peoples vulnerable to various unlawful activities that impede rational business decisions
and fair competition in a market economy. Such activities include, but are not limited to,
extortion, corruption, migrant smuggling, trafficking in persons, money laundering,

counterfeiting, credit card and other financial fraud, and intellectual property theft. Many
of these activities tend to impede or disrupt the safe and secure international movement
of passengers and goods across international lines. They also attack the integrity and
reliability of international financial systems. Corruption and extortion activities by
organized crime groups can even undermine the integrity of government and imperil
fragile democracies. And, the failure of governments to effectively control international
crime rings within their borders or their willingness to harbor international criminals
endangers global stability. There must be no safe haven where criminals can roam free,
beyond the reach of our extradition and legal assistance treaties.

Open markets must be preserved, laws and regulations governing financial institutions
must be standardized, and international law enforcement cooperation in the financial
sector must be improved for the benefits of economic globalization to be preserved.

The United States is implementing a number of initiatives and strategies tailored to
combat various forms of international crime. For example, we launched the National
Money Laundering Strategy, under which the Departments of Treasury and Justice work
to disrupt illegal profit flows to organized crime groups. The Presidential Decision
Directive on International Organized Crime directs close coordination among Federal
agencies to identify, target, and disrupt the activities of criminal groups, and the
President's International Crime Control Strategy establishes the broad goals and
implementing objectives for this effort. Finally, in December 2000, the United States
published its first-ever comprehensive International Crime Threat Assessment detailing
criminal activities around the globe that impact our national security.

The United States is pursuing efforts to combat international crimes that are economic in
origin, but the effects of which transcend economics. They include crimes that result in
the contamination of the environment, such as the illegal international movement of
chloro-fluorocarbons (CFCs) that attack the ozone layer, thereby endangering all life on
earth. They also include crimes that threaten the world's diversity through illegal
trafficking in endangered and threatened species of flora and fauna. The United States
continues to work with nations around the world to counter these crimes.

Smaller-Scale Contingencies

Smaller-scale contingency (SSC) operations encompass the full range of military
operations short of major theater warfare, including peacekeeping operations, enforcing
embargoes and no-fly zones, evacuating U.S. citizens, reinforcing key allies, neutralizing
NBC weapons facilities, supporting counterdrug operations, protecting freedom of
navigation in international waters, providing disaster relief and humanitarian assistance,
coping with mass migration, and engaging in information operations. These challenging
operations are likely to arise frequently and require significant commitments of human
and fiscal resources over time. These operations also put a premium on the ability of the
U.S. military to work closely and effectively with other United States Government
agencies, non-governmental organizations, regional and international security
organizations and coalition partners.

In general, SSC operations are aimed at checking aggression and addressing local and
regional crises before they escalate or spread. Thus, while SSCs may involve other than
""vital"" national security interests, resolving SSCs gives us the chance to prevent greater
and costlier conflicts that might well threaten U.S. vital interests.

The United States need not take on sole responsibility for operations and expenditures in
SSCs. In fact, we have encouraged and supported friends and allies' assumption of both

participatory and leadership roles in regional conflicts. Such encouragement, in theory,
constitutes a fruitful middle ground between inaction and conflict. In practice, the United
States has recently played a role in a number of successful coalition operations. These
include participating in NATO-led Bosnia and Kosovo operations with predominantly
European troop participation; providing logistical, intelligence, and other support to
operations in East Timor; and supporting the United Nations' and Economic Community
of West African States' leadership roles in seeking peace for Sierra Leone.

Coalition efforts in SSCs raise the critical question of command and control. Under no
circumstances will the President ever relinquish his constitutional command authority
over U.S. forces. However, there may be times in the future, just as in the past, when it is
in our interest to place U.S. forces under the temporary operational control of a
competent allied or United Nations commander.

There is an important role for the United Nations as a tool in managing conflict. UN
peacekeeping operations can be a very effective alternative to direct intervention by the
United States. The Brahimi report on peacekeeping reform offers many good
recommendations that, if implemented, can make this tool even more effective as an
instrument of policy.

As in regional conflict, conducting smaller-scale contingencies means confronting new
threats such as terrorism, information attack, computer network operations, and the use
or threat of use of weapons of mass destruction. United States forces must also remain
prepared to withdraw from contingency operations if they are needed in the event of a
major theater war. Accordingly, we must continue to train, equip, and organize U.S.
forces to be capable of performing multiple missions at any given time.

Major Theater Warfare

Fighting and winning major theater wars is the ultimate test of our Armed Forces -- a test
at which they must always succeed. For the foreseeable future, the United States,
preferably in concert with allies, must have the capability to deter and, if deterrence fails,
defeat large-scale, cross-border aggression in two distant theaters in overlapping time
frames. Maintaining a two major theater war capability reassures our friends and allies
and makes coalition relationships with the United States more attractive. It deters
opportunism elsewhere when we are heavily involved in deterring or defeating
aggression in one theater, or while conducting multiple smaller-scale contingencies and
engagement activities in other theaters. It also provides a hedge against the possibility
that we might encounter threats larger or more difficult than expected. A strategy for
deterring and defeating aggression in two theaters ensures that we maintain the
capability and flexibility to meet unknown future threats, while continued global
engagement helps preclude such threats from developing.

Fighting and winning major theater wars entails three challenging requirements. First, we
must maintain the ability to rapidly defeat initial enemy advances short of the enemy's
objectives in two theaters, in close succession. We must maintain this ability to ensure
that we can seize the initiative, minimize territory lost before an invasion is halted, and
ensure the integrity of our warfighting coalitions. Failure to defeat initial enemy advances
rapidly would make the subsequent campaign to evict enemy forces from captured
territory more difficult, lengthy and costly, and could undermine U.S. credibility and
increase the risk of conflict elsewhere.

Second, the United States must be prepared to fight and win under conditions where an
adversary may use asymmetric means against us -- unconventional approaches that

avoid or undermine our strengths while exploiting our vulnerabilities. Because of our
conventional military dominance, adversaries are likely to use asymmetric means, such
as NBC weapons, information operations, attacks on our critical infrastructure, or
terrorism. Such asymmetric attacks could be used to disrupt the critical logistics pipeline -
- from its origins in the United States, along sea and air routes, at in-transit refueling and
staging bases, to its termination at airfields, seaports, and supply depots in theater -- as
well as our forces deployed in the field. The threat of NBC attacks against U.S. forces in
theater or U.S. territory could be used in an attempt to deter U.S. military action in
defense of its allies and other security interests.

We are enhancing the preparedness of our Armed Forces to effectively conduct
sustained operations despite the presence, threat, or use of NBC weapons. These efforts
include development, procurement, and deployment of theater missile defense systems
to protect forward-deployed military personnel, as well as enhanced passive defenses
against chemical and biological weapons, improved intelligence collection and
counterforce capabilities, heightened security awareness and force protection measures
worldwide. We are also enhancing our ability to defend against hostile information
operations, which could, in the future, take the form of a full-scale, strategic information
attack against our critical national infrastructures, government, and economy -- as well as
attacks directed against our military forces.

Third, our military must also be able to transition to fighting major theater wars from a
posture of global engagement -- from substantial levels of peacetime engagement
overseas as well as multiple concurrent smaller-scale contingency operations.
Withdrawing from such operations would pose significant political and operational
challenges. Options available to the National Command Authorities (NCA) may include
backfilling those forces withdrawn from contingency operations or substituting for forces
committed to such operations. Ultimately, however, the United States must accept a
degree of risk associated with withdrawing from contingency operations and engagement
activities in order to reduce the greater risk incurred if we failed to respond adequately to
major theater wars.

The Decision to Employ Military Forces

The decision whether to use force is dictated first and foremost by our national interests.
In those specific areas where our vital interests are at stake, our use of force will be
decisive and, if necessary, unilateral.

In situations posing a threat to important national interests, military forces should only
be used if they are likely to accomplish their objectives, the costs and risks of their
employment are commensurate with the interests at stake, and other non-military means
are incapable of achieving our objectives. Such uses of military forces should be
selective and limited, reflecting the importance of the interests at stake. We act in concert
with the international community whenever possible, but do not hesitate to act unilaterally
when necessary.

The decision to employ military forces to support our humanitarian and other interests
focuses on the unique capabilities and resources the military can bring to bear, rather
than on its combat power. Generally, the military is not the best tool for humanitarian
concerns, but under certain conditions use of our Armed Forces may be appropriate.
Those conditions exist when the scale of a humanitarian catastrophe dwarfs the ability of
civilian relief agencies to respond, when the need for relief is urgent and only the military
has the ability to provide an immediate response, when the military is needed to establish
the preconditions necessary for effective application of other instruments of national

power, when a humanitarian crisis could affect U.S. combat operations, or when a
response otherwise requires unique military resources. Such efforts by the United States,
preferably in conjunction with other members of the international community, will be
limited in duration, have a clearly defined mission and end state, entail minimal risk to
U.S. lives, and be designed to give the affected country the opportunity to restore its own
basic services.

In all cases, the costs and risks of U.S. military involvement must be commensurate with
the interests at stake. We will be more inclined to act where there is reason to believe
that our action will bring lasting improvement. Our involvement will be more
circumscribed when regional states or organizations are better positioned to act than we
are. Even in these cases, however, the United States will be actively engaged with
appropriate diplomatic, economic, and military tools.

In every case, we will consider several critical questions before committing military force:
have we explored or exhausted non-military means that offer a reasonable chance of
achieving our goals? Is there a clearly defined, achievable mission? What is the threat
environment and what risks will our forces face? What level of effort will be needed to
achieve our goals? What is the potential cost -- human and financial -- of the operation?
What is the opportunity cost in terms of maintaining our capability to respond to higher-
priority contingencies? Do we have milestones and a desired end state to guide a
decision on terminating the mission? Is there an interagency or multinational political-
military plan to ensure that hard-won achievements are sustained and continued in the
mission area after the withdrawal of U.S. forces?

Having decided that use of military forces is appropriate, the decision on how they will be
employed is based on two guidelines. First, our forces will have a clear mission and the
means to achieve their objectives decisively. Second, as much as possible, we will seek
the support and participation of our allies, friends, and relevant international institutions.
When our vital interests are at stake, we are prepared to act alone. But in most situations,
working with other nations increases the effectiveness of each nation's actions and
lessens everyone's burden.

Sustaining our engagement abroad over the long term will require the support of the
American people and the Congress to bear the costs of defending U.S. interests --
including the risk of losing U.S. lives. Some decisions to engage abroad with our military
forces could well face popular opposition, but must ultimately be judged by whether they
advance the interests of our nation in the long run. When we judge it to be in our interest
to intervene, we must remain clear in our purposes and resolute in our actions. We must
also ensure that protection of that force is a critical priority and that our protection efforts
visibly dissuade potential adversaries.

Preparing for an Uncertain Future

We must prepare for an uncertain future, even as we address today's security problems.
We need to look closely at our national security apparatus to ensure its effectiveness by
adapting its institutions to meet new challenges. This means we must transform our
capabilities and organizations -- diplomatic, defense, intelligence, law enforcement, and
economic -- to act swiftly and to anticipate new opportunities and threats in today's
continually evolving, highly complex international security environment. We must also
have a strong, competitive, technologically superior, innovative, and responsive industrial
and research and development base and a national transportation system with the
resources and capacity to support disaster response and recovery efforts if national
mobilization is required.

Strategically, our transformation within the military requires integrating activities in six
areas: service concept development and experimentation; joint concept development and
experimentation; robust processes to implement changes in the Services and joint
community; focused science and technology efforts; international transformation
activities; and new approaches to personnel development that foster a culture of bold
innovation and dynamic leadership.

The military's transformation requires striking a balance among three critical funding
priorities: maintaining the ability of our forces to shape and respond today; modernizing to
protect the long-term readiness of the force; and exploiting the revolution in military
affairs to ensure we maintain our unparalleled capabilities to shape and respond
effectively in the future. Transformation also means taking prudent steps to position us to
effectively counter unlikely but significant future threats -- particularly asymmetric threats.

Investment in research and development is an essential element of our transformation
effort. It permits us to do what we do best: innovate, not copy. Revolutionary, not
evolutionary, leaps will happen in an economy where new ideas can be pursued and
quickly translated from vision to reality. It is a competitive advantage that leverages our
technological breakthroughs into sustained military superiority. This requires support not
only for bringing promising technologies out of the labs for insertion in weapons
platforms, but also for fundamental research that will produce the as-yet-unknown
technologies that will give the United States the revolutionary advantages we will need in
the future. Ultimately, our development efforts must be practical and founded in war-
fighting objectives tested through aggressive experimentation.

At the same time we push technological frontiers and transform our military, we also must
address future interoperability with multinational partners. Since they will have varying
levels of technology, a tailored approach to interoperability that accommodates a wide
range of needs and capabilities is necessary. We must encourage our more technically
advanced friends and allies to build the capabilities that are particularly important for
interoperability, including the command, control, and communication capabilities that form
the backbone of combined operations. We must help them bridge technological gaps,
supporting international defense cooperation and multinational ventures where they
enhance our mutual support and interoperability.

In May 2000, the United States spearheaded a Defense Trade Security Initiative (DTSI);
a package of 17 measures designed to enhance allied interoperability and coalition
warfighting capabilities by facilitating the transfer of critical U.S.-origin defense items to
our allies. At the same time, DTSI promotes a strong and robust allied transnational
defense industrial base that can provide innovative and affordable products needed to
meet allied warfighting requirements for the 21st century.

Transformation extends well beyond the acquisition of new military systems -- we seek to
leverage advanced technological, doctrinal, operational and organizational innovations
both within government and in the commercial sector to give U.S. forces greater
capabilities and flexibility. Joint Forces Command and the Armed Services are pursuing
an aggressive, wide-ranging innovation and experimentation program to achieve that
transformation. The Service programs focus on their core competencies and are
organized to explore capability improvements in the near-, mid-, and far-term. The Joint
Forces Command program ensures a strong joint perspective while also complementing
efforts by the Services. A multilateral program has also been developed. NATO's
Defense Capabilities Initiative now includes both a NATO-centered and nation-centered
concept development and experimentation program, which Joint Forces Command
complements with a joint experimentation program to include allies, coalition partners and
friends. A recently inaugurated interagency process on Contingency Planning offers the

promise of improving the coordination among government agencies well before a crisis is
at hand.

The on-going integration of the Active and Reserve components into a Total Force is
another important element of the transformation. Despite the rapid pace of technological
innovation, the human dimension of warfare remains timeless. In this era of multinational
operations and complex threats involving ethnic, religious, and cultural strife, regional
expertise, language proficiency, and cross-cultural communications skills have never
been more important to the U.S. military. We will continue to transform and modernize
our forces by recruiting, training, and retaining quality people at all levels of the military
and among its civilian personnel who bring broad skills, an innovative spirit, and good
judgement to lead dynamic change into the 21st century.

To support the readiness, modernization and transformation of our military forces, we will
work with the Congress to enact legislation to implement the Defense Reform Initiative,
which will free up resources through a revolution in business affairs. This effort includes
competitive sourcing, acquisition reform, transformation of logistics, and elimination of
excess infrastructure through two additional rounds of base realignment and closure. The
Administration, in partnership with the Congress, will continue to ensure that we maintain
the best-trained, best-equipped and best-led military force in the world for the 21st
century.

In the area of law enforcement, the United States is already facing criminal threats that
are much broader in scope and much more sophisticated than those we have confronted
in the past. We must prepare for the law enforcement challenges arising from emerging
technology, globalization of trade and finance, and other international dynamics. Our
strategy for the future calls for the development of new investigative tools and
approaches as well as increased integration of effort among law enforcement agencies at
all levels of government, both in the United States and abroad.

We will continue efforts to construct appropriate 21st century national security programs
and structures government-wide. We will continue to foster innovative approaches and
organizational structures to better protect American lives, property and interests at home
and abroad.

Promoting Prosperity

Globalization, which has drawn our economic and security interests closely together, is
an inexorable trend in the post-Cold War international system. It is logical, then, for the
United States to capture its positive energy and to limit its negative outcomes, where they
exist. In doing both we will be able to promote shared prosperity, the second core
objective of our national security strategy.

Strengthening Financial Coordination

As a result of economic globalization, prosperity for the United States and others is
inextricably linked to foreign economic developments. Interdependence of this degree
makes it incumbent upon the United States to be a cooperative leader and partner in the
global financial system. This means doing our part to provide economic and political
support to international financial institutions; working to reform them; equipping them with
the tools necessary to react to future financial crises; and expanding them to embrace
sustainable development efforts in emerging market economies.

Our objective is to build a stable, resilient global financial system that promotes strong
global economic growth while providing broad benefits in all countries. Throughout the
past seven years, Congress and the President have worked together to enhance funding
for international economic institutions and programs. Promoting our prosperity requires
us to sustain these commitments in the years and decades ahead.

Drawing on the lessons of the Mexican peso crisis in 1994 and the Asian crises in 1997
and 1998, the United States took the lead in advocating steps to strengthen the
architecture of the international financial system so that it more effectively promotes
stronger policies in emerging market economies, works to prevent crises, and is better
equipped to handle crises when they do occur. As part of a proactive effort to retool the
system, the United States proposed creation of the Contingent Credit Line in the IMF to
encourage countries to avoid crises. In addition to providing external incentives, it assists
these countries to also improve their own debt management. The United States has also
taken the initiative in 1999 and 2000, once financial stability was restored, to advocate a
series of reforms in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. These
include restructuring lending instruments, introducing greater transparency and
accountability into their operations, increasing efforts to reduce vulnerability in advance of
crisis, and involving private sector creditors in crisis resolution.

Some developing countries face particularly difficult challenges in their efforts to achieve
sustainable development. The HIPC Initiative, as both an international assistance and
development tool, provides multilateral debt reduction to countries facing unmanageable
debt burdens. In addition to providing $1 billion in support to the HIPC, the United States
has led the IMF, World Bank, and other financial institutions to focus attention and
resources on the health, education, environment, and poverty issues that surround
sustainable development.

Promoting an Open Trading System

In a world where over 96% of the world's consumers live outside the United States, the
Nation's domestic economic growth is predicated on our success in expanding trade with
other nations.

Since 1993, the President has negotiated over 300 distinct trade agreements. Prominent
among these have been the following, which have resulted in declining unemployment,
rising standards of living, and robust economic growth in the United States:

« The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which institutionalized
our trading relationship with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA created the world's
largest free trade zone, expanded trade among its three signatories by over 85%,
and generated increased U.S. exports to both Mexico and Canada. Mexico and
Canada now take nearly 40% of U.S. exports.

+ The Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which
created the WTO and created, or substantially expanded, multilateral trade rules
and commitments to cover agriculture, services, and intellectual property rights.
The WTO has been instrumental in assisting transition economies to progress
from centrally planned to market economies and promoting growth and
development in poor countries. The United States continuously leads accession
negotiations with countries who are seeking WTO membership and who are
willing to meet its high standards of market access and rules-based trading.

+ Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, which will provide American
farmers, businesses, and industries with market access to the world's most
populous nation.

We have consistently advocated trade liberalization with our values in mind, ensuring that
increased trade advances, rather than weakens, the rights of workers and the health of
the environment.

NAFTA was historic because it mandated environmental and labor protections; it was the
first trade agreement to explicitly create the link between trade liberalization and the
protection of labor rights and the environment. History was again made this year when
the United States entered into a Free Trade Agreement with the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan. Language in the agreement ensures that liberalization of trade between both
nations, the protection of labor rights, and safeguarding the environment are mutually
supportive.

The United States ensured that the WTO preamble established environmental protection
as an overall objective of the parties to the agreement. In November of 1999, the
President issued an executive order on Environmental Reviews of Trade Agreements, an
order requiring careful environmental analysis of major new trade agreements. The Office
of the United States Trade Representative and the Council on Environmental Quality
oversee the implementation of the order, ensuring that promoting trade and protecting the
environment go hand-in-hand.

Numerous regional economic partnerships also facilitate global trade. In addition to
NAFTA, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC), the President's trade and
investment initiative in Africa, the Transatlantic Economic Partnership, and negotiations
to create the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005 promote open trade in
other economic trading regions critical to our national security. With the enactment of the
U.S.-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act of 2000 and the Africa Growth and
Opportunity Act of 2000, the United States set out to deepen and widen its regional
economic relationships.

A Congressional grant of ""fast track"" authority to the President would enhance his ability
to break down foreign trade barriers in a timely manner. ""Fast track"" promotes American
prosperity, just as it expedites domestic job creation and economic growth.

Enhancing American Competitiveness

Gaining the full benefit of more open markets requires an integrated strategy that
maintains our technological advantages, promotes American exports abroad, and
ensures that export controls intended to protect our national security do not unnecessarily
make U.S. high technology companies less competitive globally.

Technological advantage

We will continue to support a vigorous science and technology base that promotes
economic growth, creates high-wage jobs, sustains a healthy, educated citizenry, and
provides the basis for our future military systems. We will continue to foster the open
interchange of people and ideas that underpins our scientific and technological
enterprise. We will invest in education and training to develop a workplace capable of
participating in our rapidly changing economy. And, we will invest in world-class
transportation, information, and space infrastructures for the 21st century.

Export Advocacy

The Administration created America's first national export strategy, working with the
private sector to reform the way government and business cooperate to expand exports.
The Trade Promotion Coordination Committee has been instrumental in improving export
promotion efforts, coordinating our export financing, implementing a government-wide
advocacy initiative, and updating market information systems and product standards
education.

This export strategy is working, and the United States has regained its position as the
world's largest exporter. While our strong export performance has supported millions of
new, export-related jobs, we must export more in the years ahead if we are to further
strengthen our trade balance position and raise living standards with high-wage jobs.

Enhanced Export Control

The United States is a world leader in high technology exports, including satellites,
cellular phones, computers, information security, and commercial aircraft. Some of this
technology has direct or indirect military applications, or may otherwise be used by states
or transnational organizations to threaten our national security. For that reason, the
United States Government carefully controls high technology exports by placing
appropriate restrictions on the sale of goods and technologies that could impair our
security. Imposing these controls recognizes that, in an increasingly competitive global
economy, where there are many non-U.S. suppliers, excessive restrictions will not limit
the availability of high technology goods. Rather, they serve only to make U.S. high
technology companies less competitive globally, thus losing market share and becoming
less able to produce cutting-edge products for the U.S. military and our allies.

Our current export control policy recognizes that we must balance a variety of factors. On
the one hand, our policies must promote and encourage the sale of our most competitive
goods abroad, while on the other, they must ensure that technologies that facilitate
proliferation of F do not end up in the wrong hands. Our policies therefore promote high
technology exports by making dual-use license decisions more transparent, predictable,
and timely through a rigorous licensing process administered by the Department of
Commerce at the same time that we ensure a thorough review of dual-use applications
by the Departments of Defense, State, and Energy. Any agency that disagrees with a
proposed export can enter the issue into a dispute resolution process that, if necessary,
may ultimately rise to the President for adjudication. As a result, reviews of dual-use
licenses are today more thorough than ever before. In the case of munitions exports, we
are committed to a policy of responsible restraint in the transfer of conventional arms and
technologies. A key goal in the years ahead is to strengthen worldwide controls in this
area, while facilitating exports of items that we wish to go to our allies and coalition
partners. The DTSI, which we look to enhance our future interoperability with our friends
and allies, is one such effort that will streamline U.S. munitions export control processes
while also devoting additional resources to increasing the security scrutiny applied to
munitions exports. The President's decision to seek agreements with close allies that
would permit extension of Canada-like exemptions to the ITAR for low risk exports will
significantly enhance U.S. competitiveness while also enhancing export controls.

Encryption is an example of a specific technology that requires careful balance. Export
controls on encryption must be a part of an overall policy that balances several important
national interests, including promoting secure electronic commerce, protecting privacy
rights, supporting public safety and national security interests, and maintaining U.S.
industry leadership. After reviewing its encryption policy and consulting with industry,

privacy and civil liberties groups, the Administration implemented significant updates to
encryption export controls in January 2000 and concluded a second update in October
2000. The new policy continues a balanced approach by streamlining export controls
while protecting critical national security interests. U.S. companies now have new
opportunities to sell their software and hardware products containing encryption, without
limits on key length, to global businesses, commercial organizations and individuals.
Most U.S. mass-market software products, previously limited to 56 and 64 bit keys, are
approved for export to any end user.

In October 2000, the Administration finished another review of its policy to ensure that it
maintains balance while taking into account advances in technology and changes in
foreign and domestic markets. The most significant change is that the U.S. encryption
industry may now export encryption items and technology license-free to the European
Union and among several countries (including major trading partners outside of Western
Europe). The update is consistent with recent regulations adopted by the European
Union; thus assuring continued competitiveness of U.S. industry in international markets.
Other policy provisions implemented to facilitate technological development include
streamlined export provisions for beta test software, products that implement short-range
wireless encryption technologies, products that enable non-U.S.-sourced products to
operate together, and technology for standards development. Post-export reporting is
also streamlined to increase the relief to U.S. companies of these requirements.
Reporting will no longer be required for products exported by U.S.-owned subsidiaries
overseas, or for generally available software pre-loaded on computers or handheld
devices. These initiatives will assure the continuing competitiveness of U.S. companies in
international markets, consistent with the national interest in areas such as electronic
commerce, national security, and support to law enforcement.

Similarly, computer technology is an area where the application of export controls must
balance our national security concerns with efforts to promote and strengthen America's
competitiveness. It is likely we will continue to face extraordinarily rapid technological
changes that demand a regular review of export controls. Maintaining outdated controls
on commodity-level computers would hurt U.S. companies without benefiting our national
security. For these reasons, in February 2000, the Administration announced reforms to
computer export controls; the reforms permit sales of higher-level computer technology to
countries friendly to the United States. Export control agencies will also review advances
in computer technology on an ongoing basis and provide the President with
recommendations for updating computer export controls every six months.

U.S. efforts to stem proliferation cannot be effective without the cooperation of other
countries. We have strengthened cooperation through a host of international WMD
nonproliferation regimes, and we will continue to actively seek greater transparency in
conventional arms transfers. These efforts enlist the world community in the battle
against the proliferation of WMD, advanced conventional weapons and sensitive
technologies, while at the same time producing a level playing field for U.S. business by
ensuring that our competitors face corresponding export controls.

Providing for Energy Security

The United States depends on oil for about 40% of its primary energy needs, and roughly
half of our oil needs are met with imports. And although we import less than 15% of the
oil exported from the Persian Gulf, our allies in Europe and Asia account for about 80% of
those exports. For some years, the United States has been undergoing a fundamental
shift away from reliance on Middle East oil. Venezuela is consistently one of our top
foreign suppliers, and Africa now supplies 15% of our imported oil. Canada, Mexico, and

Venezuela combined supply almost twice as much oil to the United States as the Arab
OPEC countries. The Caspian Basin, with potential oil reserves of 160 billion barrels, also
promises to play an increasingly important role in meeting rising world energy demand in
coming decades.

Conservation measures and research leading to greater energy efficiency and alternative
fuels are a critical element of the U.S. strategy for energy security. Our research must
continue to focus on developing highly energy-efficient buildings, appliances, and
transportation and industrial systems, shifting them where possible to alternative or
renewable fuels, such as hydrogen, fuel cell technology, ethanol, or methanol from
biomass.

Conservation and energy research notwithstanding, the United States will continue to
have a vital interest in ensuring access to foreign oil sources. We must continue to be
mindful of the need for regional stability and security in key producing areas, as well as
our ability to use our naval power, if necessary, to ensure our access to, and the free flow
of, these resources.

Promoting Sustainable Development

True and lasting social and economic progress must occur in a sustainable fashion, that
meets the human and environmental needs for enduring growth. Common but reparable
impediments to sustainable development include:

+ Lack of education, which shuts people out from participation in technological
advance.

+ Disease and malnutrition, which stifle productivity.

* Pollution, environmental degradation, and unsustained population growth, the
remediation of which is much more costly than pre-emptive action.

* Uncontrolled exploitation of natural resources (e.g., overhunting or overfishing
of species for food, overcutting of timber for firewood, overgrazing of grasslands
by cattle), which can be serious impediments to sustainable development.

+ Unsustainable foreign debt obligations, which encourage currency devaluations
and capital flight, and can absorb a substantial share of small economies’
resources.

Efforts by the United States to foster sustainable development include:

+ Promoting sound development policies that help build the economic and social
framework needed to encourage economic growth and poverty reduction and
facilitate the effective use of external assistance.

+ Debt relief to free up developing countries' resources for meeting the basic
needs of their people. The United States led the G-7 in adopting the Cologne
Debt Initiative for reducing debts owed them by those of the world's poorest
countries committed to sound policies that promote economic growth and poverty
reduction. The resulting plan is embodied in the HIPC Initiative.

+ Public health assistance consisting of grants, loans, and tax incentives for the
prevention and treatment of epidemics such as AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis,
as well as the training of individuals to continue providing public health services.

+ Human capacity development assistance for basic education and literacy
programs, job skills training, and other programs specifically designed to protect
women's health, provide educational opportunity, and promote women's
empowerment.

+ Leadership in the G-8 and OECD to raise environmental standards for export
credit agencies and international financial institutions.

In consonance with our values, when a nation that embraces globalization gets left
behind, the United States and other proponents of globalization should reach out a hand.
Doing so in a manner that promotes not just development, but sustainable development,
enhances regional stability, steadily expands the economic growth on which demand for
our exports depends, and honors our values, which encourage us to share our wealth
with others and inspire growth for more than just ourselves.

Promoting Democracy and Human Rights

The third goal of our national security strategy is to promote democracy, human rights,
and respect for the rule of law. Since the founding of the republic, our actions as a Nation
have always been guided by our belief that individuals should control their own destinies:
economically, politically, and spiritually. Our core values -- political and economic
freedom, respect for human rights, and the rule of law -- support this belief, guiding the
conduct of our government at home as well as in its dealings with others outside our
borders. Much as John Winthrop set a standard for early colonists that we ""be as a city
upon a hill,"" nearly four centuries later we still seek to demonstrate the power of our
democratic ideals and values by our example. This does not make us turn inward or
isolationist, nor should it be interpreted as a bid for hegemony. Rather, in keeping with
our values, we have lent our encouragement, support, and assistance to those nations
and peoples that freely desire to achieve the same benefits of liberty. The extraordinary
movement of nations away from repressive governance and toward democratic and
publicly accountable institutions over the last decade reflects how these ideals, when
allowed to be freely shared, can spread widely and rapidly, enhancing the security of all
nations. Despite some minor setbacks for a few of the newer democracies in the last
several years, the trend continues. Since the success of many of those changes is by no
means assured, our strategy must focus on strengthening the commitment and capacity
of nations to implement democratic reforms, protect human rights, fight corruption and
increase transparency in government. For this reason, we join with other nations in
creating the community of democracies. In June 2000, 106 countries meeting in Warsaw,
Poland endorsed the Warsaw Declaration laying out criteria for democracy and pledging
to help each other remain on the democratic path.

Emerging Democracies

The United States works to strengthen democratic and free market institutions and norms
in all countries, particularly those making the transition from closed to open societies.
This commitment to see freedom and respect for human rights take hold is not only just,
but pragmatic. Our security depends upon the protection and expansion of democracy
worldwide, without which repression, corruption and instability could engulf a number of
countries and threaten the stability of entire regions.

The sometimes difficult road for new democracies in the 1990's demonstrates that free
elections are not enough. Genuine, lasting democracy also requires respect for human
rights, including the right to political dissent; freedom of religion and belief; an
independent media capable of engaging an informed citizenry; a robust civil society and
strong Non-governmental Organization (NGO) structures; the rule of law and an
independent judiciary; open and competitive economic structures; mechanisms to
safeguard minorities from oppressive rule by the majority; full respect for women's and
workers’ rights; and civilian control of the military.

The United States is helping consolidate democratic and market reforms in Central and
Eastern Europe and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. Integrating
new democracies in Europe into European political, economic and security organizations,
such as NATO, OSCE, the EU, and the Council of Europe, will help lock in and preserve
the impressive progress these nations have made in instituting democratic and market-
economic reforms. Consolidating advances in democracy and free markets in our own
hemisphere remains a high priority. In the Asia Pacific region, economic dynamism is
increasingly associated with political modernization, democratic evolution, and the
widening of the rule of law. Indonesia's October 1999 election was a significant step
toward democracy and we will do our part to help Indonesia continue on that path. In
Africa, we are particularly attentive to states, such as South Africa and Nigeria, whose
entry into the community of market democracies may influence the future direction of an
entire region.

The methods for assisting emerging democracies are as varied as the nations involved.
Our public diplomacy programs are designed to share our democratic experience in both
government and civil society with the publics in emerging democracies. We must
continue leading efforts to mobilize international economic and political resources, as we
have with Russia, Ukraine, and other countries in Eastern Europe and Eurasia, and with
Southeast Europe. We must take firm action to help counter attempts to reverse
democracy, as has happened in Fiji, Haiti, Pakistan, Paraguay, and Peru.

We must help democratizing nations strengthen the pillars of civil society by supporting
administration of justice and rule of law programs; promoting the principle of civilian
control of the military; and training foreign police and security forces to solve crimes and
maintain order without violating the basic human rights of their citizens. And we must
seek to improve their market and educational institutions, fight corruption and political
discontent by encouraging good governance practices, and encourage a free and
independent local media that may promote these principles without fear of reprisal.

Adherence to Universal Human Rights and
Democratic Principles

We must sustain our efforts to press for adherence to democratic principles, and respect
for basic human rights and the rule of law worldwide, including in countries that continue
to defy democratic advances. Working bilaterally and through international institutions,
the United States promotes universal adherence to democratic principles and
international standards of human rights. Our efforts in the United Nations, the Community
of Democracies, and other organizations continue to make these principles the governing
standards for acceptable international behavior.

Ethnic conflict represents a great challenge to our values and our security. When it erupts
in ethnic cleansing or genocide, ethnic conflict becomes a grave violation of universal
human rights. We find it clearly opposed to our national belief that innocent civilians

should never be subject to forcible relocation or slaughter because of their religious,
ethnic, racial, or tribal heritage. Ethnic conflict can also threaten regional stability and
may well give rise to potentially serious national security concerns. When this occurs, the
intersection of our values and national interests make it imperative that we take action to
prevent -- and whenever possible stop -- outbreaks of mass killing and displacement.

At other times the imperative for action will be much less clear. The United States and
other nations cannot respond to every humanitarian crisis in the world. But when the
world community has the power to stop genocide and ethnic cleansing, we will work with
our allies and partners, and with the United Nations, to mobilize against such violence --
as we did in Bosnia and Kosovo.

Our response will not be the same in every case. Sometimes concerted economic and
political pressure, combined with diplomacy, is the best answer. At other times, collective
military action is appropriate, feasible, and necessary. The way the international
community responds will depend upon the capacity of countries to act, and on their
perception of their national interests.

Events in the Bosnia conflict and preceding the 1994 genocide in Rwanda demonstrate
the pernicious power of inaccurate and malicious information in conflict-prone situations.
This made apparent our need to effectively use our information capabilities to counter
misinformation and incitement, prevent and mitigate ethnic conflict, promote independent
media organizations and the free flow of information, and support democratic
participation. As a result, in the spring of 1999, the President directed that all public
diplomacy and international information efforts be coordinated and integrated into our
foreign and national security policy-making process.

We will also continue to work -- bilaterally and with international institutions -- to ensure
that international human rights principles protect the most vulnerable or traditionally
oppressed groups in the world -- women, children, indigenous people, workers, refugees,
and other persecuted persons. To this end, we will seek to strengthen international
mechanisms that promote human rights and address violations of international
humanitarian law, such as the LIN Commission on Human Rights and the international
war crimes tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. We strongly support wide
ratification of the ILO Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. We also aim to
implement fully those international human rights treaties to which we are a party.

It is our aim to ensure protection for persons fleeing situations of armed conflict or
generalized human rights abuses by encouraging governments not to return refugees to
countries where they face persecution or torture. We also seek to focus additional
attention on the more vulnerable or traditionally oppressed people by spearheading new
international initiatives to combat the sexual exploitation of minors, child labor, use of
child soldiers, and homelessness among children.

Violence against, and trafficking in, women and children are international problems with
national implications. We have seen cases of trafficking in the United States for purposes
of forced prostitution, sweatshop labor, and domestic servitude. Our efforts have
expanded to combat this problem, both nationally and internationally, by increasing
awareness, focusing on prevention, providing victim assistance and protection, and
enhancing law enforcement. The President continues to call upon the Senate to give its
advice and consent to ratification to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of
Discrimination Against Women, which will enhance our efforts to combat violence against
women, reform unfair inheritance and property rights, and strengthen women's access to
fair employment and economic opportunity.

Promotion of religious freedom is one of the highest concerns in our foreign policy.
Freedom of thought, conscience and religion is a bedrock issue for the American people.
To that end, the President signed the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which
provides the flexibility needed to advance religious freedom and to counter religious
persecution. In September 1999, we completed the first phase outlined in the Act with
publication of the first annual report on the status of religious freedom worldwide, a 1,100
page document covering the status of religious freedom in 194 countries. In October, we
designated and sanctioned the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, Burma, China, Iran, Iraq,
Sudan, and the Milosevic regime in Serbia as ""countries of particular concern"" for having
engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom. The United
States is active throughout the world assisting those who are persecuted because of their
religion and promoting freedom of religious belief and practice. We will continue to work
with individual nations and with international institutions to combat religious persecution
and promote religious freedom.

The United States will continue to speak out against human rights abuses and it will
continue to carry on human rights dialogues with countries willing to engage us
constructively. Because police and internal security services can be a source of human
rights violations, we use training and contacts between U.S. law enforcement and their
foreign counterparts to help address these problems. We do not provide training to police
or military units implicated in human rights abuses. When appropriate, we are prepared to
take strong measures against human rights violators. These include economic sanctions,
visa restrictions, and restricting sales of arms and police equipment that may be used to
commit human rights abuses. The Administration proposed legislation to prevent the
United States from becoming a safe haven for human rights violators. Both the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are
coordinating investigative efforts on cases involving allegations of human rights abuse to
pursue criminal prosecution or administrative removal proceedings in appropriate
instances.

In the 1990s, the United States took the lead in seeking compensation for Holocaust
survivors, many of whom are impoverished. Over a million individuals are eligible to apply
for benefits under agreements concluded with Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. We
must now be certain that these agreements are carried out in a fair and equitable
manner, and that steps are taken to complete the work we have commenced in the areas
of Holocaust education, the payment of Holocaust era insurance policies, and the
restitution of art and other property.

Humanitarian Activities

Our efforts to promote democracy and human rights are complemented by our
humanitarian programs, which are designed to alleviate human suffering, address
resource and economic crises that could have global implications, and pursue
appropriate strategies for economic development.

We also must seek to promote reconciliation in states experiencing civil conflict and to
address migration and refugee crises. To this end, the United States will provide
appropriate financial support and work with other nations and international bodies, such
as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees. We also will assist efforts to protect the rights of refugees and displaced
persons and to address the economic and social root causes of internal displacement
and international flight.

Private firms and NGOs that principally address human rights issues or democratic
principles often become natural allies in assisting in the relief of humanitarian crises. We
frequently find we have natural partners in labor unions, human rights groups,
environmental advocates, and chambers of commerce in providing international
humanitarian assistance. In providing this often life saving assistance, these private and
non-governmental groups visibly demonstrate another aspect of, and complement to, our
democratic values -- one of helping others in need. All of these values are thus seen by
the individuals and governments helped by these organizations, and they underscore
why our support of the humanitarian assistance efforts of private and non-governmental
groups is in keeping with our values and objective of promoting democracy and human
rights.

Supporting the global movement toward democracy requires a pragmatic, long-term effort
focused on both values and institutions. Our goal is a broadening of the community of
free-market democracies, and stronger institutions and international non-governmental
movements committed to human rights and democratization.

Ill. Integrated Regional Approaches

Our policies toward different regions reflect our overall strategy and guiding principles but
must be tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities of each region. Thus, each
uses a different application of the elements of engagement and does so in differing
degrees. Each region may have its own focused strategic objectives, but, in the end,
enhancing our own and the region's security while promoting prosperity, democracy, and
human rights are still the ultimate goals.

Europe and Eurasia

European stability is vital to our own security. The United States has three strategic goals
in Europe: integration of the region, a cooperative transatlantic relationship with Europe
on global issues, and fostering opportunities while minimizing proliferation risks posed by
collapse of the Soviet Union. The first goal, building a Europe that is truly integrated,
democratic, prosperous, and at peace, would realize a vision the United States launched
more than 50 years ago with the Marshall Plan and NATO. The greatest challenge to that
remains the integration of Southeastern Europe into the rest of Europe, a strategic
objective the United States shares with its NATO allies and the EU. The United States, its
allies, and the EU recognize that continued instability, ethnic conflict, and potentially open
warfare in Southeastern Europe would adversely affect European security and set back
the process of creating a Europe that is truly whole and free. Accordingly, our strategy
involves a series of interlocking building blocks, the progressive and interactive
implementation of which will achieve step-by-step shared objectives. The building blocks
identified below define our common priorities for Southeastern Europe, and -- more
importantly -- the pursuit of each helps the attainment of all:

* Coexistence among ethnic groups and the rebuilding of civic society;

+ Promotion of the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes to
undo the pernicious consequences of ethnic cleansing;

+ Economic reform and revitalization, leading to sustainable economic growth;

+ Democratic government based on the rule of law and full respect for human
rights;

+ Support for the nascent democratic government in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY) as a means for advancing its return to the international
community;

- A peaceful resolution of the status of Montenegro and Kosovo through
arrangements acceptable to all sides;

* Strengthening regional cooperation as a basis for the region's revitalization and
eventual integration with the rest of Europe;

+ Adherence to international agreements such as the Dayton Accords, especially
in recognition of international boundaries.

We are making progress towards our objectives. With the toppling of the Milosevic
regime and the ascension of President Kostunica and his government, the process of
transition from authoritarian rule to democratic governance is underway in the FRY. The
United States and the international community support democratization and economic
reform in the FRY to ensure long-lasting change, the removal of impediments to positive
social, political, and economic change, and the stability and growth of the entire region of
Southeastern Europe. Democratic consolidation and Western integration of the FRY will
not be easy, but the United States stands ready to contribute to the achievement of these
long-awaited goals.

Elsewhere in Southeastern Europe, elections in Croatia this year saw the victory of a pro-
Western, pro-reform government that has become a constructive and stabilizing force in
the region. Reform-minded leaders in Macedonia, Albania, and Slovenia continue to
press forward with difficult economic reforms. Croatia and Albania both became WTO
members this year, on the basis of commercially meaningful commitments that bolster
their economic reform programs. Moderate pro-Dayton elements share political power in
Bosnia. Kosovars had the opportunity to choose local leaders for the first time this year in
Kosovo's democratic elections, and relatively moderate candidates were elected by large
majorities. The FRY's new democratic leadership is moving quickly to integrate their
nation into Europe and restore constructive cooperation with its neighbors. But much
work remains. Economic and political reforms that will allow Southeastern European
nations to move forward towards European integration must be accelerated. While
Milosevic is out of power in the FRY, democratic change has not yet been consolidated
and the new government faces a difficult winter. Greater ethnic reconciliation in Bosnia
and Kosovo remains elusive. Security conditions allowing eventual withdrawal of U.S.
troops from the region have still not been fully realized. Without a broad strategy of
engagement and strong U.S. leadership, our vision of a stable, democratic, and
prosperous Europe will not be realized.

Our second goal is to work with our allies and partners across the Atlantic to meet the
global challenges no nation can meet alone. This means working together to consolidate
this region's historic transition in favor of democracy and free markets; supporting peace
efforts in troubled areas both within and outside the region; tackling global threats such
as the potential use and continued proliferation of NBC weapons, terrorism, drug
trafficking, international organized crime, environmental, problems, or health crises; mass
uncontrolled migration of refugees, and building a more open world economy without
barriers to transatlantic trade and investment.

Our third goal is to develop the opportunities opened by the collapse of the Soviet Union
while minimizing the associated proliferation risks. Russia, Ukraine, and the other New
Independent States (NIS) today are undergoing fundamental changes to their political,
economic, and social systems -- the outcome will have a profound impact on our own
future and security. Core U S. security interests are being advanced through our
engagement with these countries, such as through U.S. efforts to help secure and
dismantle the former Soviet arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. Our engagement
also helps frame the key choices that only the peoples of the former Soviet Union and
their leaders can make about their future, their role in world affairs, and the shape of their
domestic political and economic institutions. Our strategy utilizes a long-term vision for
the region, recognizing that this unprecedented period of transition will take decades, if
not generations to complete.

Enhancing Security

NATO remains the anchor of U.S. engagement in European security matters, the
foundation for assuring collective defense of Alliance members, and the linchpin of
transatlantic security. As the leading guarantor of European security and a force for
European stability, NATO must play a leading role in promoting a more integrated and
secure Europe; one prepared to respond to new challenges. At the same time, the United
States actively supports the efforts of our European partners to develop their own
European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP). We further support European efforts to
increase and improve capabilities for collective defense and crisis response operations,
including the capability to act militarily under the EU when NATO, as a whole, is not
engaged. We seek a relationship that will benefit current, and the potential future,
members of both organizations, and we intend to remain fully engaged in European
security issues, both politically and militarily. The United States has maintained
approximately 100,000 military personnel in Europe to fulfill our commitments to NATO.
They provide a visible deterrent against aggression and coercion, contribute to regional
stability, respond to crises, sustain our vital transatlantic ties, and preserve U.S.
leadership in NATO.

NATO is pursuing several initiatives to enhance its ability to respond to the new
challenges it will face in the 21st century. At NATO's Fiftieth Anniversary Summit in April
1999, Alliance leaders adopted an expansive agenda to adapt and prepare NATO for
current and future challenges. This included an updated Strategic Concept, which
envisions a larger, more capable and more flexible Alliance, committed to collective
defense and able to undertake new missions. The Defense Capabilities Initiative (DCI)
aims to improve defense capabilities and interoperability among NATO military forces,
thus bolstering the effectiveness of multinational operations across the full spectrum of
Alliance missions, to include Partner forces where appropriate. NATO and the EU are
also forging a strategic partnership that will further reinforce European capabilities and
contributions to transatlantic security. NATO's WMD Initiative, the other activities of
NATO's senior groups on proliferation, and U.S. bilateral NBC defense cooperation with
key allies, will increase the ability of the Alliance to counter the threat of NBC weapons
and their means of delivery.

NATO enlargement has been a crucial element of the U.S. and Allied strategy to build an
undivided, peaceful Europe. At the April 1999 NATO Summit, the alliance welcomed the
entry of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as new members. The accession of
these three nations has made the Alliance stronger and has reinforced Europe's zone of
democratic stability.

Together with our allies, we are pursuing efforts to help other countries that aspire to
membership become the best possible candidates. These efforts include the NATO
Membership Action Plan and the Partnership for Peace. We are also continuing bilateral
programs to advance this agenda, such as the President's Warsaw Initiative, which is
playing a critical role in promoting Western-style reform of the armed forces of Central
and Eastern Europe, and Eurasia and helping them become more interoperable with
NATO. Some European nations do not desire NATO membership, but do desire
strengthened ties with the Alliance. The Partnership for Peace provides an ideal vehicle
for such relationships. It formalizes relations, provides a mechanism for mutual beneficial
interaction, and establishes a sound basis for combined action, should that be desired.
This can be seen in the major contributions some Partnership for Peace members have
made to NATO missions in the Balkans. Also, on a bilateral basis, the United States has
concluded security of classified information agreements with all former Warsaw Pact
countries.

NATO is pursuing several other initiatives to enhance its ability to respond to new
challenges and deepen ties between the Alliance and Partner countries. NATO's Euro-
Atlantic Partnership Council continues to strengthen political dialogue and practical
cooperation with all partners, and the Alliance values its distinctive partnership with
Ukraine, which provides a framework for enhanced relations and practical cooperation.
We welcome Russia's re-engagement with NATO and Permanent Joint Council on the
basis of the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act. Our shared goal remains to deepen and
expand constructive Russian participation in the European security system.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has a key role to play
in enhancing Europe's stability. It provides the United States with a venue for developing
Europe's security architecture in a manner that complements our NATO strategy. In many
instances, cooperating through the OSCE to secure peace, deter aggression, and
prevent, defuse and manage crises, broadens international support for the resolution of a
particular security issue, and gives regional actors greater latitude to develop their own
stability mechanisms. The Charter also recognizes that European security in the 21st
century increasingly depends on building security within societies as well as security
between states. In Istanbul, President Clinton joined the other 29 parties to the Treaty on
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) in signing the CFE Adaptation Agreement,
which will replace obsolete bloc-to-bloc force limitations with nationally-based ceilings
and provide for enhanced transparency of military forces through increased information
and more inspections. The United States will continue to give strong support to the OSCE
as our best choice to engage all the countries of Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia
in an effort to advance democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and to encourage
them to support one another when instability, insecurity, and human rights violations
threaten peace in the region.

Kosovo - Securing the Peace

On March 24,1999, after repeated attempts at diplomatic solutions had failed, NATO
intervened militarily to end a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing launched by the
Milosevic regime in Belgrade against the ethnic Albanian community in Kosovo. During
the eleven-week air campaign that comprised Operation Allied Force, fourteen of the
Alliance's nineteen members participated in more than 38,000 combat sorties, almost
one third the number flown during the 1991 Desert Storm campaign. In the end, due to
the application of force in concert with continued international pressure, Milosevic
capitulated, agreeing to NATO's conditions including the return of all refugees, the
withdrawal of his military and police forces, and the deployment of an international civil
and military presence. This unprecedented display of alliance solidarity ended Belgrade's
reign of terror and prevented the real risk that violence in Kosovo would create turmoil
throughout the region, undermining its new, fragile democracies and reversing our
progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina. NATO's intervention also set the conditions for
creating a stable, peaceful, and democratic way of life in Kosovo.

Today, assisting the international community to accomplish those objectives is a NATO-
led force (KFOR) of approximately 40,000 personnel from nearly 35 countries (including
6,000 Americans) who continue to protect the peace achieved by last year's military
action. The United States never commits its military forces lightly; the decision to
contribute to KFOR was firmly grounded in the assessment that national interests, in
particular European security and stability, were at stake. At the same time, compared to
IFOR and SFOR, we were able to share more of the burden with our European allies,
with U.S. troops comprising only 15% of the NATO-led force.

The international community continues to assist refugees and displaced persons to return
to their homes and communities, a critical step to social renewal. To date, more than

898,000 Kosovars from diverse ethnic backgrounds have returned (many with the help of
KFOR).

Rebuilding infrastructure and promoting economic growth is critical to the hope that one
day Kosovo will have a sustainable free market economy. To this end, more than 36,000
new homes have been constructed and more than 70% of private enterprises have been
restarted since the end of the war. Much more remains to be done, but the list of
impressive economic achievements continues to grow. Supporting democratic institutions
and processes is crucial component of our strategy. In October 2000, free and open
municipal elections were held for the first time in Kosovo's history, a key step in
establishing the autonomous institutions necessary for the Kosovars to govern
themselves.

Finally, we continue to promote multiethnic reconciliation in recognition that real
democracy requires peaceful coexistence among all ethnic groups and credible
protection for minority rights. Statistics indicate a dramatic decline in crime over the past
year in Kosovo; however, sporadic ethnic violence still challenges the international
community and requires our vigilance.

Today, Kosovo is largely an international protectorate focused on rebuilding itself and
inculcating respect for the rule of law. As these intermediate goals are attained, however,
Kosovo will continue its journey toward becoming a self-administering democratic
community within a unified Europe. Kosovo's final status will ultimately be determined
through a political process. The United States will work closely with the EU to ensure that
the necessary political and economic environment exists to allow Kosovo's final status to
be resolved eventually.

Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) - Promoting
Democracy

The prospects for sustained peace, stability, and growth throughout the region have
improved with the removal of President Milosevic and the election of FRY President
Kostunica. President Kostunica's victory signaled the end of destructive and isolationist
policies of the Milosevic regime. His government has indicated a desire to seek a future
with Europe. The United States remains committed to the people of Serbia and we will
support the new democratic governments stated aspirations to reintegrate into Europe
and the international community, and to use the transition as an opportunity to foster
democracy and market reform in the FRY.

In Montenegro, the democratically elected government of President Djukanovic has made
significant progress in implementing political and economic reforms. The United States
will continue to support Montenegro and encourage dialogue and negotiation between
Montenegro and the new democratic government in Belgrade.

In cooperation with our allies and the international community, efforts are underway to
reintegrate the FRY into regional and international organizations. For example, in
October 2000, the United States supported FRY admission into the Stability Pact and the
United Nations. In November 2000, the U.S. supported the FRY's entry into OSCE. The
FRY has also begun discussions with the IMF and World Bank on membership -- as one
of the successor states to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia -- and has asked
to join the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). To bolster the
FRY's democratic transition, the United States supported removal of the energy embargo
and the travel ban, while maintaining sanctions on financial transactions and trade that
could still benefit Milosevic and his cronies. The United States is assessing Serbia's

immediate and long-term assistance and humanitarian needs, and is promoting dialogue
and negotiation between Montenegro, Kosovo and a new democratic Serb government.
While the success of the Kostunica government's effort to consolidate power and build
democracy is by no means certain, and while peace in the region remains fragile, the
United States stands ready to support the Serbian people at this historic moment in their
efforts to have the FRY become a productive member of the international community of
democracies.

Bosnia - Implementing Dayton

The full implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords is key to developing Bosnia as a
stable, peaceful and economically viable state within Southeastern Europe. Dayton
implementation will not only foster Bosnia's integration with Europe, but will also provide
the conditions for eventual withdrawal of U.S. troops. To that end, we continue to support
the return of refugees, implementation of political and economic reforms, the weakening
of the nationalist political parties' grip on political and economic power, the strengthening
of state institutions, the reform and integration of the Entity Armed Forces, and the
apprehension of remaining war criminals.

While Dayton implementation continues to be measured and incremental, we are making
progress. Refugee returns have increased significantly in 2000, in part due to a more
secure environment established by NATO-led forces and international financial support.
The improved security situation has allowed SFOR to reduce the number of troops in
Bosnia from IFOR's initial commitment of 60,000 soldiers in 1995 to current levels of
20,800 -- a reduction by roughly two-thirds. Further progress in implementing Dayton will
allow for further reduction in our military presence.

Along with the international community, we continue to press Bosnian officials to
accelerate efforts to promote the rule of law, fight corruption, institute economic reforms
and create stable state institutions, including those associated with the armed forces.
Recent elections have seen growing political pluralism among the electorate and the
advancement of moderate, pro-Dayton parties. We seek to support these trends.

Bosnia has benefited from dramatic political change in Croatia, where a reform-oriented
government was elected earlier this year. Upon taking power, the new government sent
Bosnian Croats the unequivocal message that their future was in Bosnia, not Croatia, and
that they should support the full implementation of the Dayton Accords. Croatia's new
political orientation has led to the rise of moderate forces in the dominant Bosnian Croat
political party and has resulted in a significant decline in Croatian support for the Bosnian
Croat component of the Federation army, a necessary step for full military integration in
the Federation.

Unfortunately, in the Republika Srpska (RS) some hard-line nationalists still resist efforts
to implement several Dayton objectives, from refugee returns to the arrest of war
criminals. While we have had some success in moving the Dayton process forward,
genuine and sustainable change in the Republika Srpska will depend in part on the
cooperation of the new government in the FRY. President Kostunica's public support for
the Dayton Accords is encouraging, but must be matched by concrete actions to
encourage Bosnian Serbs to pursue their future as part of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Finally, it is imperative to our objectives that remaining Bosnian war criminals are
apprehended and sent to The Hague. Consequently, we strongly support the efforts of
the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In 2000, six
additional indicted war criminals were transferred to the ICTY, five of whom were

detained by SFOR. The ICTY's work in the region has also benefited from the enhanced
cooperation offered by the new government in Croatia.

Cyprus and the Aegean

Tensions on Cyprus, Greek-Turkish disagreements in the Aegean, and Turkey's
relationship with the EU have serious implications for regional stability and the evolution
of European political and security structures. Our goals are to stabilize the region by
reducing long-standing Greek-Turkish tensions, pursuing a comprehensive settlement on
Cyprus, and supporting Turkey's full integration into European institutions. A democratic,
secular, stable, and Western-oriented Turkey is critical to these efforts and has supported
broader U.S. efforts to enhance stability in Bosnia, the nations of the former Soviet Union
and the Middle East, as well as to contain Iran and Iraq. The President's trip to Turkey
and Greece in November 1999 highlighted encouraging signs of progress for
reconciliation in the region, including talks on the Cyprus dispute that are being held
under the auspices of the UN in New York and Geneva. The EU's historic decision in
December 1999 at its Helsinki Summit to grant candidate status to Turkey -- which the
United States strongly encouraged -- reinforced the development of Greek-Turkish
rapprochement, while encouraging Turkey to expand its democracy and observance of
human rights for all its citizens.

The Baltic States

The special nature of our relationship with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania is recognized in
the 1998 Charter of Partnership, which clarifies the principles upon which U.S. relations
with the Baltic States are based and provides a framework for strengthening ties and
pursuing common goals. These goals include integration of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia
into the transatlantic community and development of close, cooperative relationships
among all the states in Northeastern Europe. Through the Northern European Initiative
we seek to strengthen regional cooperation, enhance regional security and stability, and
promote the growth of Western institutions, trade and investment by bringing together the
governments and private sector interests in the Baltic and Nordic countries, Poland,
Germany, and Russia.

Northern Ireland

Historic progress was achieved in implementing the Good Friday Accord when, on
December 2, 1999, an inclusive power-sharing government was formed in Northern
Ireland, the principle of consent was accepted with respect to any change in the territorial
status of Northern Ireland, new institutions were launched for North-South cooperation on
the island of Ireland, and the Irish Republican Army named a representative to the
Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) of paramilitary
weapons (loyalist paramilitaries named their representatives to the IICD soon thereafter).
Although differences over the arms decommissioning issue led to suspension of the new
institutions on February 11, 2000, the institutions were restored on May 27 following
agreement between the British and Irish governments and political leaders. On June 25,
the IICD reported that international inspectors visited several IRA arms dumps and
concluded that the weapons were secure and could not be used without the IICD
becoming aware that this happened. The IRA announced on June 26 that it had
reestablished contact with the IICD. These developments followed continued progress in
promoting human rights and equality in Northern Ireland, including the introduction of
legislation to implement the important recommendations put forward for police reform in
the Patten Report issued on September 9, 1999. Disagreements over progress on
decommissioning of arms have affected progress.

The United States continues to work with the British and Irish governments and the
political leaders in Northern Ireland to achieve full implementation of the Good Friday
Accord. Working through the International Fund for Ireland and the private sector, we will
help the people seize the opportunities that peace will bring to attract new investment and
bridge the community divide, create new factories, workplaces, and jobs, and establish
new centers of learning for the 21st century.

Russia and the Newly Independent States (NIS)

There is no historical precedent for the transition underway in Russia, Ukraine, and other
NIS. The United States has core national interests at stake in those endeavors and has
acted quickly to help people across the NIS to break the back of the Communist system.
But the USSR's collapse created new challenges. In Russia, for example, rigidity often
gave way to laxness and disorder -- too many rules were replaced by too few. The United
States' engagement with each of the NIS recognizes that their transformation will be a
long-term endeavor, with far-reaching implications for regional and global stability, as well
as disappointments and setbacks along the way.

Open elections are now commonplace in Russia, Ukraine, and most other NIS. We will
continue to engage with all these countries to improve their electoral processes and help
strengthen civil society by working with grassroots organization, independent media, and
emerging entrepreneurs. Though the transition from communism to market democracy is
far from complete, the NIS have reduced state controls over their economies and
instituted basic protections for private property. It is in our national interest to help them
develop the laws, institutions, and skills needed for a market democracy, to fight crime
and corruption, and to advance human rights and the rule of law. The conflict in
Chechnya represents a major problem in Russia's post-Communist development and
relationship with the international community; the means Russia is using in Chechnya are
undermining its legitimate objective of upholding its territorial integrity and protecting
citizens from terrorism and lawlessness.

The United States strategy toward Russia and the NIS has made every American safer.
Threat reduction programs have assisted in the deactivation of former Soviet nuclear
warheads and greatly decreased the possibility of sensitive materials, technology,
expertise, or equipment falling into the wrong hands. We are working aggressively to
strengthen export controls in Russia and the other NIS and to stem proliferation of
sensitive missile and nuclear technology, as well as other WMD or advanced
conventional weapons to potential regional aggressors such as Iran. The Administration
has supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the NIS, including through
agreement on the adapted CFE Treaty, which was made possible by agreed schedules
for the withdrawal of Russian forces from Georgia and Moldova. The integration of
Russia, Ukraine, and other NIS with the new Europe and the international community
remains a key priority. Despite disagreements over NATO enlargement and the Kosovo
conflict, Russian troops serve shoulder-to-shoulder with U.S. and NATO forces in Kosovo
and Bosnia. The United States remains committed to further development of the NATO-
Russia relationship and the NATO-Ukraine distinctive partnership.

Our engagement with Russia, Ukraine, and other NIS is broad-based and draws upon
new ties and partnerships between U.S. and NIS cities, regions, universities, scientists,
students, and business people. United States assistance programs have helped these
countries begin to develop the laws and legal infrastructure necessary for the rule of law
as well as the building blocks of civil society. Still, the challenges ahead in each of these
areas are immense. Economic hardship, social dislocation, and rampant crime and
corruption threaten the foundations of democratic and law-based governance. Looming
environmental problems will complicate NIS governments’ ability to develop appropriate

and effective responses and policies. Similarly, government pressure on independent
media, citizens groups, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and religious groups
remain a recurring source of concern.

We must continue our efforts to encourage strong and effective property laws and
practices in central and Eastern Europe. Such laws are a necessity for a society based
on the rule of law, and are a prerequisite for competing in international markets and
participating in Western institutions. A starting point is the enactment and enforcement of
laws providing for the restitution of property, seized during the Nazi and communist eras,
to rightful owners.

Promoting Prosperity

Europe is a key partner in America's global commercial engagement. Europe and the
United States produce almost half of all global goods and services; more than 60% of
total U.S. investment abroad is in Europe; commerce between us exceeds $1 billion
every day; and fourteen million workers on both sides of the Atlantic earn their livelihoods
from transatlantic commerce. As part of the New Transatlantic Agenda launched in 1995,
the United States and the EU agreed to take concrete steps to reduce barriers to trade
and investment through creation of an open New Transatlantic Marketplace and through
Mutual Recognition Agreements in goods that eliminate redundant testing and
certification requirements. Our governments are also cooperating closely with the civil
society dialogues established under the New Transatlantic Agenda: the Transatlantic
Business Dialogue, Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue, Transatlantic Environment
Dialogue, and Transatlantic Labor Dialogue. These people-to-people dialogues create
opportunities for increased communication focusing on best practices, and can help their
governments identify and reduce barriers to greater transatlantic interaction. In return, our
governments should be committed to listen, learn, and facilitate.

Building on the New Transatlantic Agenda, the United States and the EU launched the
Transatlantic Economic Partnership in 1998 to deepen our economic relations, reinforce
our political ties and reduce trade frictions. The first element of the initiative is reducing
barriers that affect manufacturing, agriculture, and services. In manufacturing, we are
focusing on standards and technical barriers that American businesses have identified as
the most significant obstacle to expanding trade. In agriculture, we are focusing on
regulatory barriers that have inhibited the expansion of agriculture trade, particularly in
the biotechnology area. In services, we seek to facilitate trade in specific service sectors,
thereby creating new opportunities for the service industries that are already so active in
the European market.

The second element of the Transatlantic Economic Partnership is a broader, cooperative
approach to addressing a wide range of trade issues. We will continue to refrain from
imposing duties on electronic transmissions and develop a work program in the WTO for
electronic commerce. We will seek to adopt common positions and effective strategies for
accelerating compliance with WTO commitments on intellectual property. We will seek to
promote government procurement opportunities, including promoting compatibility of
electronic procurement information and government contracting systems. To promote fair
competition, we will seek to enhance the compatibility of our procedures with potentially
significant reductions in cost for U.S. companies.

The United States strongly supports the process of European integration embodied in the
EU. We support EU enlargement, and we are also encouraging bilateral trade and
investment in non-EU countries. We recognize that EU nations face significant economic
challenges and that periods of economic stagnation have eroded public support for

funding outward-looking foreign policies and greater integration. We are working closely
with our European partners to expand employment, promote long-term growth, and
support the New Transatlantic Agenda.

Within Southeastern Europe, President Clinton and other international leaders launched
a relatively new addition to the security architecture of Europe in July 1999. Called the
""Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe,"" the pact is a historic partnership between the
international community and the countries of Southeastern Europe, designed to bolster
security and advance integration into the European and transatlantic mainstream by
accelerating the region's democratic and economic development. By reducing ethnic
conflict, promoting democratization and civil society, increasing trade and investment
opportunities and supporting regional cooperation, we are promoting stability and
prosperity in the region and providing a basis for greater integration into Europe.

Since the inception of the Stability Pact, donors have committed approximately $6 billion
in development assistance for the countries of Southeastern Europe. European countries
and institutions, together with international financial institutions, are providing over 85% of
this assistance. Of this $6 billion, the international community has pledged more than
$2.3 billion for over 200 ""Quick Start"" projects -- many of which are focused on energy,
water and transport infrastructure improvements that will have an immediate impact on
people's lives. All of the ""Quick Start"" projects are to be underway by the end of March
2001.

In support of economic development and reform in Southeastern Europe, the U.S. is
promoting increased investment throughout the region. OPIC has launched a $150
million equity investment fund that will invest in companies in a range of sectors,
including telecommunications, light manufacturing, distribution and consumer goods. The
United States and the EBRID have created a $150 million fund to provide technical
assistance and lending, in cooperation with local financial institutions, to promote micro,
small and medium enterprise development in Southeast Europe. The United States will
work with the EBRID to expand the operation of this fund and other activities to
Montenegro.

To combat corruption and bureaucratic uncertainty, countries in the region have agreed
under the Stability Pact to increase efforts to promote transparency and the rule of law.
Under the agreed upon Anti-Corruption Initiative, each member country in the region has
committed to make domestic government procurements more transparent, take specific
measures to promote public service integrity, and establish a review body to monitor
accountability in the administration of foreign aid programs and national anti-corruption
efforts.

To promote deeper integration with the rest of Europe and transatlantic institutions, the
United States supports EU efforts to play a leading role in the Stability Pact and
welcomes closer relations between the EU and the countries of the region. We are urging
the EU to strengthen these ties and to act quickly on proposals to open further its
markets to Southeastern European products. As the United States’ support (in October
and November 2000) for FRY admission into the Stability Pact, UN, and OSCE
demonstrates, guidelines like those expressed by the Stability Pact serve as worthy
benchmarks for inclusiveness into a wider circle of nations.

The United States will continue its strong support for the Stability Pact and broader
stabilization efforts. In October 2000, the FRY was formally admitted to join the Stability
Pact. The critical challenge for the Stability Pact in the coming months is to persuade the
international community and Southeastern Europe that it is in their mutual interests to
follow through on important commitments that each has made to the other.

Now that the government in Belgrade has changed, the United States is promoting
reintegration of the FRY into regional and international organizations. The energy
embargo and travel ban have been lifted, and we are working with the Europeans and
other donors to identify priorities for assistance and reconstruction, including Danube
River cleanup.

As in other areas in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the NIS, the United States
will continue helping former planned economies integrate into international economic and
other institutions and develop healthy business climates. We will continue to promote
political and economic reform in Russia, working to create a thriving market economy
while guarding against corruption. By supporting historic market reforms in these areas,
we help new democracies take root by avoiding conditions, such as corruption and
poverty, that can weaken democratic governance and erode the appeal of democratic
values.

We are working with many NIS countries to promote their accession to the WTO on
commercially fair terms. Building on successful accession of Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Estonia,
Georgia, Albania, Croatia, and Moldova, we have made significant progress on the
accession of Armenia and Lithuania. We also have held fruitful discussions on WTO with
Russia and Ukraine. We will continue to mobilize the international community to provide
assistance to support reform and to help the Central and Eastern European and NIS
countries stimulate foreign and domestic private investment. We are also encouraging
investment in these countries, especially by U.S. companies.

We focus particular attention on promoting the development of Caspian energy resources
and their export to world markets, thereby expanding and diversifying world energy
supplies and promoting prosperity in the region.

Getting Caspian energy to world markets will help achieve important goals. It will help
enhance prospects for prosperity and independence of the Caspian states. It can help
support the development of stable democratic countries, and bolster relationships among
the states. Development of Caspian energy resources will improve our energy security,
as well as that of Turkey and other allies. It will create commercial opportunities for U.S.
companies and other companies around the world. Throughout the region, targeted
exchange programs have familiarized key decision makers and opinion molders with the
workings of our democracy.

The independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and democratic and economic reform
of the NIS are important to U.S. interests. To advance these goals, we are utilizing our
bilateral relationships and our leadership of international institutions to mobilize
governmental and private resources. But the circumstances affecting the smaller
countries depend in significant measure on the fate of reform in the largest and most
powerful -- Russia. The United States will continue to promote Russian reform and
international integration, and to build on the progress that already has been made. Our
economic and political support for the Russian government depends on its commitment
to internal reform and a responsible foreign policy.

Promoting Democracy and Human Rights

Democratic reforms in Central and Eastern Europe and Eurasia are the best measures to
avert conditions that could foster ethnic violence and regional conflict. Already, the
prospect of joining or rejoining the Western democratic family through NATO, the EU,
and other institutions has strengthened the forces of democracy and reform in many
countries of the region and encouraged them to settle long-standing disputes over

borders and ethnic minorities. Together with our West European partners we are helping
these nations build civil societies.

We continue to promote the integration of Southeastern Europe's democracies into the
European mainstream by promoting democratic, economic and military reforms,
deepening regional cooperation, and supporting regional efforts to fight organized crime.
The opening of a Southeast Europe Cooperation Initiative (SECI) information
clearinghouse in Bucharest in the spring of 1999 highlighted efforts by SECI to integrate
the efforts of national law enforcement agencies in the fight against cross-border crime.
The UN, EU, and NATO operations in the area focused on developing professional civil
and military institutions that are respectful and promote human rights and respect for civil
authority. Landmark democratic elections in Croatia at the beginning of 2000, and
important regional elections, such as those held in Montenegro in June 2000, showed
promise for the process of democracy. Where the democratic transition is still in
progress, or threatened by external influences, the situation bears continued vigilance. In
Kosovo, where violence continued to plague efforts to restore stability, promote
tolerance, and begin the establishment of a Kosovar capacity for substantial self-rule, we
are determined to succeed in the protection of the rights of individual minorities and the
implementation of an ambitious democratic framework for the people of Kosovo.

Municipal elections in Kosovo have paved the way for the establishment of local
institutions as the international community encourages the creation of a constitutional
framework for Kosovar autonomy called for under the Ramboulliet Agreement and UN
Security Council Resolution 1244. As local Kosovars accept responsibility for the process
of democracy and protection of minority rights, our efforts in Kosovo will shift from a focus
on military security and the training of international and indigenous police forces, to
deepened support for those civil efforts that promote democracy, the rule of law, and
respect for human rights.

We continue to support the efforts of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia. In 2000, the pace of detention, transfer, and prosecution of indicted war
criminals remained brisk, especially as the new government in Croatia reaffirmed that
country's support for the implementation of the Dayton Agreements. New opportunities
have also opened with the change of government in Belgrade. We and our European
allies have made clear to President Kostunica his obligation to cooperate with the ICTY
and our expectation that all indicted war criminals, including former President Milosevic,
will be held accountable.

East Asia and the Pacific

Our regional strategy is based on the premise that a stable and prosperous East Asia
and Pacific is vital to our own national security interests. United States leadership in
expanding mutually beneficial economic relationships and U.S. security commitments
within the Pacific rim are central to stability, and even more importantly, they foster an
environment within which all Asia/Pacific nations can prosper. We continue to advance
this vision of the Asia/Pacific by promoting democracy and human rights, advancing
economic integration and rules-based trade, and enhancing security. These three pillars
of our security strategy for Asia are mutually reinforcing, and provide the framework for
our bilateral and multilateral initiatives. Cooperation with our allies and friends in the
region to achieve our common goals remains a cornerstone of our strategy.

Enhancing Security

Our military presence and our strong bilateral security ties have been essential to
maintaining the peace and security that have enabled most nations in the Asia-Pacific
region to build thriving economies for the benefit of all. To deter aggression and secure
our own interests, we maintain about 100,000 military personnel in the region in
cooperation with our allies and partners. The U.S.-Japan security alliance anchors the
U.S. presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Our continuing security role is further reinforced
by our bilateral treaty alliances with the Republic of Korea (ROK), Australia, Thailand and
the Philippines. We maintain healthy relations with the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) and support regional dialogue -- such as in the ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF) -- on the full range of common security challenges.

Our security strategy in East Asia and the Pacific encompasses a broad range of
potential threats, and includes the following priorities: deterring aggression and promoting
peaceful resolution of crises; promoting access to and the security of sea lines of
communication in cooperation with our allies and partners; actively promoting our
nonproliferation goals and safeguarding nuclear technology; strengthening both active
and passive counterproliferation capabilities of key allies; combating the spread of
transnational threats, including drug-trafficking, piracy, terrorism and the spread of AIDS;
fostering bilateral and multilateral security cooperation, with a particular emphasis on
combating transnational threats and enhancing future cooperation in peacekeeping
operations; and promoting regional dialogue through bilateral talks and multilateral fora.

Japan

The U.S.-Japan alliance remains the cornerstone for achieving common security
objectives and maintaining a peaceful and prosperous environment for the Asia Pacific
region. The 1997 revised Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation create a solid
basis for more effective and credible U.S.-Japan cooperation in peacetime, in the event
of an armed attack on Japan, and in situations in areas surrounding Japan. They provide
a general framework for the roles and missions of the two countries, and facilitate
coordination in peacetime and contingencies. The revised Guidelines, like the U.S.-Japan
security relationship itself, are not directed against any other country; rather, they enable
the U.S.-Japan alliance to continue fostering peace and security throughout the region. In
April 1998, in order to support the new Guidelines, both governments agreed to a revised
Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) that expands the provision of
supplies and services to include reciprocal provision of logistics support during situations
surrounding Japan that have an important influence on Japan's peace and security.
Japan approved implementing legislation for the Guidelines in the spring of 1999. Japan's
generous host-nation support for the U.S. overseas presence also serves as a critical
strategic contribution to the alliance and to regional security.

Our bilateral security cooperation has broadened as a result of recent agreements to
undertake joint research and development on theater missile defense and to cooperate
on Japan's indigenous satellite program. Moreover, we work closely with Japan to
promote regional peace and stability, seek universal adherence to the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty, and address the dangers posed by transfers of destabilizing
conventional arms and sensitive dual-use technologies. Japan is providing $1 billion to
the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO), and consults closely
with the United States and ROK on issues relating to North Korea.

Korean Peninsula

Tensions on the Korean Peninsula, albeit reduced as a result of the June 2000 North-
South Summit, remain the leading threat to peace and stability in East Asia. The
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has publicly stated a preference for
peaceful reunification, but continues to dedicate a large portion of its dwindling resources
to its huge military forces. Renewed military conflict has been prevented since 1953 by a
combination of the Armistice Agreement, which brought an end to open hostilities; the
United Nations Command, which has visibly represented the will of the UN Security
Council to secure peace; the physical presence of U.S. and ROK troops in the Combined
Forces Command, which has demonstrated the alliance's resolve; and, increasingly,
diplomatic activities of the United States, ROK, and Japan.

President Kim Dae-jung continues to pursue a course toward peace and stability on the
Korean peninsula, seeking new channels of dialogue with North Korea and developing
areas of cooperation between South and North. During their June 2000 meeting in Tokyo,
President Clinton and President Kim affirmed the importance of the North-South Summit
for building a more permanent peace, and the indispensability of the strong U.S.-ROK
defense alliance as a stabilizing pillar for the region. The United States is working to
create conditions of stability by maintaining solidarity with our South Korean and
Japanese allies, emphasizing America's commitment to shaping a peaceful and
prosperous Korean Peninsula, and ensuring that a struggling North Korea does not opt
for a military solution to its political and economic problems.

Peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict with a democratic, non-nuclear, reunified
peninsula will enhance peace and security in the East Asian region and is clearly in our
strategic interest. We have taken steps to improve bilateral political and economic ties
with North Korea -- consistent with the objectives of our alliance with the ROK -- to draw
the North into more normal relations with the region and the rest of the world. Secretary
Albright furthered that objective during her historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim
Jong 11 in late October 2000. The United States has also outlined to the DPRK what
steps it must take to cut all ties to terrorism, and be considered for removal from the list of
state sponsors of terrorism. But our willingness to continue to improve bilateral relations
will continue to be commensurate with the North's cooperation in efforts to reduce
tensions on the peninsula and to stem its NBC weapons programs.

South Korea has set an example for nonproliferation by accepting the 1991
Denuclearization Agreement, agreeing to IAEA safeguards, and developing a peaceful
nuclear program that brings benefits to the region. We are firm that North Korea must
maintain the freeze on production and reprocessing of fissile material, dismantle its
graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities, and fully comply with its NPT
obligations under the Agreed Framework. The United States, too, must fulfill its
obligations under the Agreed Framework, and the Administration will work with the
Congress to ensure the success of our efforts to address the North Korean nuclear
threat.

Beyond fully implementing the Agreed Framework, we seek to eliminate North Korea's
indigenous and export missile program and their weapons of mass destruction through a
step-by-step process. Based on U.S.-North Korean discussions, North Korea has
undertaken to refrain from flight testing long-range missiles of any kind as we move
toward more normal relations. Working closely with our ROK and Japanese allies, we will
improve relations with North Korea on the basis of it moving forward on the missile and
WMD agendas, and we will take necessary measures in the other direction if the North
chooses to go down a different path.

We encourage the North to work with South Korea to implement the agreements reached
at the North-South Summit; continue the United Nations Command-Korean People's
Army General Officer Dialogue at Panmunjom; participate constructively in the Four Party
Talks among the United States, China, and North and South Korea to reduce tensions
and negotiate a peace agreement; and continue our efforts to recover the remains of
American servicemen missing since the Korean War.

Pyongyang's more recent diplomatic and economic outreach to the rest of the world are
encouraging, but as yet no reciprocal confidence-building measures have been
forthcoming. It is crucial that the United States and the ROK maintain deterrence during
the process of reconciliation and economic integration on the Korean Peninsula. We
favor a step by step process of using reciprocal confidence building measures that link
economic and diplomatic initiatives to real reductions in the military threat on the
peninsula.

China

A stable, open, prosperous People's Republic of China (PRC) that respects the rule of
law and assumes its responsibilities for building a more peaceful world is clearly and
profoundly in our interests. The prospects for peace and prosperity in Asia depend
heavily on China's role as a responsible member of the international community. Our
policy toward China is both principled and pragmatic, expanding our areas of cooperation
while dealing forthrightly with our differences.

In recent years, the United States and China have taken a number of steps to strengthen
cooperation in international affairs: intensive diplomatic work to restore relations
damaged by our mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade; successful
conclusion of a bilateral agreement on Chinese WTO accession; two presidential bilateral
meetings in 2000; regular exchanges of visits by cabinet and sub-cabinet officials to
consult on political, military, security, nonproliferation, arms control, economic, financial,
and human rights issues; cooperating in efforts to account for Americans missing as a
result of World War Il and the Korean War; establishing a consultation mechanism to
strengthen military maritime safety; holding discussions on humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief, and environmental security; and establishing working groups on law
enforcement cooperation. China is also a participant in science, technology, and health
research. Our cooperation in promoting environmental protection and sustainable
development is steadily increasing to the benefit of U.S. interests in the Asia-Pacific
region.

At the same time, China's rise as a major power presents an array of potential
challenges. Many of China's neighbors are closely monitoring China's growing defense
expenditures and modernization of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Given
international and regional focus on China's growing military power, China's adherence to
multilateral nonproliferation and arms control regimes, as well as increased military
transparency, is of growing importance.

United States interests have been advanced in discussions with China on arms control
and nonproliferation issues. We have advanced our dialogue on nonproliferation and
arms control through exchanges at the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and
sub-cabinet level in 1999 and 2000, building on previous accomplishments. The United
States and China announced in earlier exchanges that they will not target their strategic
nuclear weapons at each other and confirmed their common goal of halting the spread of
WMD. Both our nations have signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We have
consulted on the Missile Technology Control Regime and missile nonproliferation, and we

continue to press China to exercise restraint in its missile policies and practices. In
November 2000, China publicly announced that it would reinforce its export control
system, and that it had no intention to assist any country in the development of ballistic
missiles that could be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Both nations have ratified the
Chemical Weapons Convention, and China has further strengthened its controls on the
export of dual-use chemicals and related production equipment and technology to assure
they are not used for production of chemical weapons. Both nations have called for
strengthening of the Biological Weapons Convention and early conclusion of a protocol
establishing a practical and effective mechanism to enhance compliance and improve
transparency. We also reached agreement with China on practices for end-use visits on
U.S. high technology exports to China and we will continue a dialogue on implementation
of this agreement.

China is working with the United States on important regional security issues. On the
Korean Peninsula, the United States and China share an interest in peace and stability
and worked together to support the June 2000 North-South Summit. We have both
worked to convince North Korea to freeze its dangerous nuclear program, and believe the
four-party peace talks are an important tool in working toward establishment of peace
and stability in Northeast Asia.

To help maintain peace, security, and stability in the Western Pacific, and to promote our
broad foreign policy objectives, we are implementing fully the terms of the Taiwan
Relations Act by maintaining unofficial relations between the American people and the
people of Taiwan. We are keeping the focus on peaceful resolution by working
assiduously to encourage the PRC and Taiwan to reestablish direct dialogue, while
maintaining our firm commitment to Taiwan's self-defense by providing defensive arms to
Taiwan.

Our key security objectives for the future include: sustaining the strategic dialogue begun
by the recent summits and other high-level exchanges; enhancing stability in the Taiwan
Strait by maintaining our ""one China"" policy, promoting peaceful resolution of cross-Strait
issues, and encouraging dialogue between Beijing and Taipei; strengthening China's
adherence to international nonproliferation norms, particularly with respect to export
controls on ballistic missile and dual-use technologies; encouraging China to adopt
broader, more effective export control policies; achieving greater openness and
transparency in China's military; encouraging a constructive PRC role in international
affairs through active cooperation in multilateral fora such as the ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF) and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC); and improving law
enforcement cooperation in such areas as counterterrorism, counternarcotics, and
migrant trafficking.

Southeast Asia and the Pacific

Our strategic interest in Southeast Asia centers on developing regional, multilateral, and
bilateral security and economic relationships that assist in conflict prevention and
resolution. United States security objectives in the region are: strengthening our security
alliances and partnerships with Australia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Singapore;
sustaining facilities access arrangements with these countries and other ASEAN nations;
and encouraging effective multilateral cooperation by expanding participation in regional
exercises geared toward disaster relief operations and combating such transnational
threats as piracy and drug-trafficking. We continue to view ASEAN as the key regional
institution for enhancing security and prosperity. We will continue to work on our
relationship with ASEAN and enhance our multilateral security dialogue under the ARF.
We must also pursue multilateral, or sometimes bilateral, initiatives with ASEAN to
address transnational issues such as the spread of infectious disease, alien smuggling,

trafficking in women and children, environmental protection, and combating organized
crime, particularly the flow of heroin from Burma and other countries in the region.

Promoting Prosperity

A prosperous and open Asia/Pacific is key to the economic health of the United States.
Thirty percent of U.S. exports go to Asia, supporting millions of U.S. jobs, and we export
more to Asia than Europe. The economic benefits of a strong Asia/Pacific are likely to
increase as China and Taiwan enter into the WTO. Our historic decision to grant
Permanent Normal Trade Relations to China will enable U.S. businesses to expand into
China under a rules-based trading regime.

Our economic objectives in the region include the following: continuing recovery from the
financial crisis; furthering progress within APEC toward liberalizing trade and investment;
increasing U.S. exports to Asia/Pacific countries through market-opening measures and
leveling the playing field for U.S. business; and concluding the WTO accession
negotiations for the PRC and Taiwan on satisfactory commercial terms.

Our strategy to meet these objectives has four key elements: support for economic
reforms and market liberalization; working with international financial institutions to
provide well-targeted economic and technical assistance in support of economic reforms;
providing bilateral humanitarian aid and contingency bilateral financial assistance if
needed; and urging strong policy actions by Japan and the other major economic powers
to promote global growth.

The United States will continue to work with the IMF, the World Bank, other international
financial institutions, the governments in the region, and the private sector to strengthen
financial markets, bolster investor confidence, and deepen on-going reforms in the
region's economies. In doing so, we will remain mindful of the need to promote protection
of worker rights. We will continue to encourage South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia to
implement economic reforms to lay a solid basis for long-term economic growth. U.S.
initiatives in APEC will open new opportunities for economic cooperation and permit U.S.
companies to expand their involvement in substantial infrastructure planning and
construction throughout the region. We will continue our efforts to encourage all Asia
Pacific nations to pursue open markets.

China

Integrating the PRC more fully into the global trading system is manifestly in our national
interest. China is a major potential market for our goods and services. Our exports to
China already support hundreds of thousands of jobs across our country and China's
WTO entry will significantly expand that number.

An important part of integrating China into the market-based world economic system is
opening China's highly protected market through elimination of trade barriers and
removal of distorting restraints on economic activity. We have negotiated and vigorously
enforced landmark agreements to combat piracy of intellectual property and advance the
interests of our creative industries. We have also negotiated -- and vigorously enforced --
agreements on textile trade. We will continue to press China to open its markets as it
engages in sweeping economic reform, and to respect and adhere to core labor
standards as codified by the ILO. Most recently, the United States reached a market
access agreement with China, paving the way for China's accession to the World Trade
Organization. The bilateral agreement concluded in November 1999 will create jobs and

opportunities for Americans through the opening of Chinese markets, promote economic
reform in China, and enhance the understanding of the Chinese people of the rule of law
in the development of their domestic civil society in compliance with international
obligations. We are now working with other Working Party members to complete the
multilateral negotiation of China's WTO accession. Our enactment of Permanent Normal
Trade Relations status for China will accelerate and expand these favorable trends.

Japan

Japan has a crucial role to play in Asia's economic health: generating substantial growth
to help maintain a growing world economy and absorb a growing share of imports from
emerging markets We have urged Japan to reform its financial sector, stimulate domestic
demand, deregulate its economy, and further open its markets to foreign goods and
services. The Administration continues to make progress on increasing market access in
Asia's largest economy. Since the beginning of the first Clinton Administration, the United
States and Japan have reached 39 trade agreements designed to open Japanese
markets in such key sectors as autos and auto parts, civil aviation, and insurance. In the
Enhanced Initiative on Deregulation, Japan agreed to regulatory reforms to promote
domestic demand-led growth and also to increase business opportunities for U.S. firms in
such vital areas as telecommunications, competition policy enforcement, and
medical/pharmaceutical products. Through the Foreign Direct Investment Initiative, Japan
agreed to measures to improve the environment for foreign investment. As a result, U.S.
firms are increasing their presence in the Japanese market by acquiring Japanese firms,
and are thereby contributing to Japan's economic recovery. The Administration also has
intensified efforts to monitor and enforce trade agreements with Japan to ensure that they
are fully implemented. The United States also uses multilateral venues, such as WTO
dispute settlement and negotiation of new multilateral agreements, to further open
markets and accomplish our trade objectives with Japan. The U.S.-Japan Common
Agenda is a bilateral U.S.-Japan program coordinating scientific and financial resources
of the world's two largest economies on more than seventy projects worldwide. The
projects focus on eradicating infectious disease, protecting the environment, and
promoting scientific and technological cooperation.

Republic of Korea

The United States will continue its strong support for South Korean efforts to reform its
economy, liberalize trade and investment, strengthen the banking system, and implement
the IMF program. We will also continue to explore concrete steps to promote growth in
both our countries, more fully open our markets, and further integrate the Republic of
Korea into the global economy.

Southeast Asia and the Pacific

The United States strongly supports efforts to sustain and strengthen economic recovery
in the ten nations of ASEAN. We accomplish this by maintaining our open market for
Southeast Asian goods and services as well as our support for IMF-led recovery
programs for several ASEAN nations. There are challenges ahead. Thailand's economic
recovery is continuing, however, high oil prices and the slow pace of banking and
corporate sector reforms are impeding Thailand's full economic recovery from the
financial crisis. Thais are preparing for elections in January 2001. The survival and
vindication of Thailand's new constitution would reflect well on the future of democracy in
Southeast Asia, but the Thais worry about political stability anead. In Indonesia, slow
progress on corporate and financial sector restructuring endangers economic recovery.
Rapid sale of assets held by the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) is the key

to alleviating the large public debt burden and improving investor sentiment. IBRA has
begun to move ahead, but without stronger support from the government, progress will
remain uneven. Privatization of the banking sector, which has been largely under
government control since the crisis, is another area of worrying policy drift. With Vietnam,
we are working toward completion of a broad commercial agreement that will open that
country's markets, promote economic reform, and open the way for congressional
approval of Normal Trade Relations for Vietnam. Nearby in Singapore, in November
2000, President Clinton and Prime Minister Goh of Singapore agreed to launch
negotiations for a free trade agreement. In addition to the economic benefits both
countries would be expected to gain, the two leaders have recognized the importance of
continued U.S. engagement in Asia based on economic and security interests. Working
with ASEAN members to address environmental degradation -- from forest fires and
haze, to fisheries depletion and deforestation -- while striving for sustainable economic
growth, is a high priority.

Australia and New Zealand

We will continue to build on our close working relationship with Australia and New
Zealand to strengthen our bilateral trade and economic relationships. We will also work
with these two key partners to develop international support for further action by APEC
and by the World Trade Organization to develop rules-based trade and encourage sector
liberalization.

Promoting Democracy and Human Rights

The United States will continue to support the democratic aspirations of Asian/Pacific
peoples and to promote respect for human rights. Our strategy is best served through
close coordination with our allies and friends in the region, both at the governmental and
non-governmental organization level. Our priorities include: progress on human rights,
religious freedom and rule of law issues in China; a meaningful political dialogue between
the ruling authorities in Burma and the democratic opposition; supporting Indonesia's
democratic transition; and contributing to East Timor's transition to independence.

Indonesia

The United States strongly supports a united, prosperous, and democratic Indonesia that
plays a positive role in regional security. The October 1999 election was a historic
moment for Indonesia, putting it on course to become the world's third largest democracy.
We continue to assist Indonesia in managing the considerable challenges of national
reconciliation, democratic reform and economic recovery. We have tailored a
comprehensive assistance package focused on: economic development; humanitarian
assistance and infrastructure development in strife-torn areas; and technical assistance
in key government sectors designed to reinforce the democratic process and the rule of
law.

Burma

The United States will continue to work with other concerned states to create the
conditions for a meaningful dialogue between the regime and the democratic opposition
led by Aung San Suu Kyi. Our strategy includes investment and other sanctions to
increase pressure on the regime to respect basic human rights. At the same time, we
support the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General to use his good offices to
promote dialogue leading to a democratic transition.

East Timor

The UN Transitional Authority in East Timor (UNTAET), established in October 1999,
followed on the success of the UN-sanctioned International force in East Timor
(INTERFET). The UN-Sanctioned International Force in East Timor was an Australian-led
mission that deployed in September 1999, with U.S. support, to quell the post-
referendum violence in East Timor. The UN Transitional Authority in East Timor took over
security responsibilities from INTERFET in February 2000. UNTAET has continued to
further the goal of an independent and viable East Timor. Our contributions have a strong
impact on UNTAET's success. We are providing long-term development assistance and
transitional employment opportunities to the East Timorese people, as well as financial
and technical support for the UN transition administration. Our military forces have
provided on-going health and infrastructure support directly to the East Timorese people,
and have maintained a presence to coordinate humanitarian and civic assistance
projects. We remain committed to attaining a durable solution to the plight of East
Timorese refugees in Indonesia. A challenge for the future is assisting with the
establishment of a small yet viable East Timor Defense Force.

The Western Hemisphere

Our hemisphere enters the 21st century with an unprecedented opportunity to secure a
future of stability and prosperity-building on the fact that virtually all nations in the
hemisphere are democratic and committed to free market economies. The end of armed
conflict in Central America and other improvements in regional security have coincided
with remarkable political and economic progress throughout the Americas. The people of
the Americas are taking advantage of the vast opportunities being created as emerging
markets are connected through electronic commerce and as maturing democracies allow
individuals to more fully express their preferences. Sub-regional political, economic, and
security cooperation in North America, the Caribbean, Central America, the Andean
region, and the Southern Cone have contributed positively to peace and prosperity
throughout the hemisphere. Equally important, the people of the Americas have
reaffirmed their commitment to combat together the difficult threats posed by drug
trafficking and corruption. The United States, which helped shape this new climate in the
hemisphere, seeks to secure its benefits while safeguarding our citizens against these
threats.

Enhancing Security

Our strategy of engagement in the Western Hemisphere has included strengthening and
expanding U.S. defense cooperation with friends throughout the region, and supporting
their efforts to institute democratic norms within their defense establishments including
civilian control, transparency, and public accountability. As these democratic norms take
root, regional confidence builds. The United States also will continue working to
strengthen regional and sub-regional cooperative security mechanisms that could serve
to deepen regional confidence and foster sustained regional stability. We will continue to
offer our strong support for the peaceful resolution of disputes in the region, and will
encourage continued dialogue and peaceful engagement among nations of the region to
achieve this goal. While respecting sovereignty concerns, we remain committed to
promoting cooperative approaches throughout the hemisphere to international
peacekeeping threats and humanitarian crises.

The principal threats to hemispheric stability are transnational in nature, such as drug
trafficking, money laundering, illegal immigration, firearms trafficking, and terrorism. In

addition, our hemisphere is leading the way in recognizing the dangers to national and
regional stability produced by corruption and ineffective judicial systems. All of these
produce adverse social effects at home and undermine the sovereignty, democracy, and
national security of nations in the hemisphere.

Particularly pernicious is the threat of drug trafficking. Working with the OAS and other
organizations, we seek to eliminate the scourge of drug trafficking in our hemisphere.
Countries of the hemisphere are striving to better organize and coordinate efforts to
extradite and prosecute individuals charged with drug trafficking and related crimes;
combat money laundering; seize assets used in criminal activity; halt illicit traffic in
precursors and essential chemicals; strike at the financial support networks; enhance
national drug abuse awareness and treatment programs; and drastically curtail illicit
crops through alternative development and eradication programs. In the Caribbean, and
bilaterally with Mexico and Colombia, we are working to increase counterdrug and law
enforcement cooperation.

At the same time, we recognize linkages between the threats posed to the United States
as the principal consumer of illicit drugs and related threats posed to source countries
and transit zone states. Accordingly, as we seek to expand regional cooperation in the
counterdrug arena, we recognize our obligation to aggressively combat the illegal export
of U.S.-origin weapons to criminal and insurgent groups that are engaged in, or benefit
from, drug trafficking.

Colombia is of special importance because drug trafficking is fueling the longest running
internal conflict in the region. The combination of armed insurgents, growing paramilitary
movement, corruption, and economic malaise extends beyond its borders and has
implications for regional peace and security. To turn the tide, the United States is
providing the Colombian Government assistance to wage a comprehensive effort to
promote the mutually reinforcing goals of peace, illicit drug control, economic
development, and respect for human rights. The Government of Colombia has developed
a comprehensive six-year strategy, Plan Colombia, to revive its economy, strengthen the
democratic pillars of society, promote the peace process, and reduce drug production
and trafficking. We are providing significant assistance for Plan Colombia in a manner
that will concurrently promote U.S. and Colombian interests, and we will encourage our
allies and international institutions to do the same.

The extent of bilateral cooperation with Mexico in the fight against drug trafficking is
unprecedented. We have created the High-Level Contact Group and a variety of working
groups to reach a joint diagnosis and settle on a common strategy. Moreover, the
mutually agreed upon Performance Measures of Effectiveness will allow us to better
evaluate our counterdrug efforts. We are working together to reduce demand for illegal
drugs, combat money laundering, avoid the misuse of precursors and essential
chemicals, stop the illegal trafficking of arms or migrants, broaden our ability to intercept
drugs, and apprehend those who are involved in drug trafficking.

Promoting Prosperity

Economic growth and integration in the Americas will profoundly affect the prosperity of
the United States in the 21st century. This begins with our immediate neighbors, Canada
and Mexico. Since the 1989 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, and subsequently the
1993 North American Free Trade Agreement, our trade with Canada and Mexico has
grown rapidly. Canada remains our largest trade partner, and Mexico has become our
second largest trading partner. The United States and Mexico have also resolved
important trade differences, made progress toward easier access for the relevant

products of both nations, and consolidated our trade area as one of the most powerful in
the world. In the hemisphere as a whole, our trade initiatives offer a historic opportunity to
capitalize on and strengthen the unprecedented trend toward democracy and free market
economics.

We seek to advance the goal of an integrated hemisphere of free market democracies by
building on NAFTA. Formal negotiations are in progress to initiate the Free Trade Area of
the Americas (FTAA) by 2005. The negotiations cover a broad range of important issues,
including market access, investment, services, government procurement, dispute
settlement, agriculture, intellectual property rights, competition policy, subsidies, anti-
dumping, and countervailing duties. We will seek to ensure that the agreement also
supports workers' rights, environmental protection and sustainable development. To
address the concerns of smaller economies prior to completion of the FTAA, and in light
of the increased competition NAFTA presents, we have obtained Congressional approval
for enhanced trade preferences offered to Central American and Caribbean countries
under the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act.

The United States will continue its effective partnership with the IMF, the World Bank, the
Inter-American Development Bank, the governments of Latin America, and the private
sector to help the region's countries in their transition to integrated, market economies. A
key target of this partnership is assisting the reform and recovery of banking sectors hurt
by financial market turmoil over the past several years. We will continue to support
financial and economic reform efforts in Brazil and Argentina to reduce their vulnerability
to external shocks, as well as help Ecuador on its difficult road to economic recovery and
sustainable levels of debt service. Similarly, we will continue to play an active role with
our regional partners in facilitating timely responses to, and recovery from natural
disasters, such as Hurricane Mitch in Honduras and Nicaragua, Hurricane Keith in Belize,
and the adverse economic disruptions throughout the region resulting from El Nino.

Helping countries in the hemisphere to translate economic growth into social progress is
critical for promoting sustainable growth and sustaining democracy. Despite recent
progress, Latin American and Caribbean countries have the greatest income disparities
of any region -- with the poorest 20% of individuals receiving just 4.5% of the total income
within the region. We will continue to support investments in human development,
particularly the provision of stronger and more efficient basic education and health
services. Between the United States and Mexico there has been significant growth in
educational programs emphasizing literacy, bilingual education and exchanges between
classroom teachers, cultural institutions and artists. In the area of health, we are creating
the Border Health Commission to study the epidemiology of the border area in order to
battle diseases.

We also view it as essential that economic prosperity in our hemisphere be pursued in an
environmentally sustainable manner. From our shared seas and freshwater resources to
migratory bird species and transboundary air pollution, the environmental policies of our
neighbors can have a direct impact on quality of life at home. Working with Mexico, we
have taken concerted action to monitor air quality, intensify research on environmental
health issues, follow the cross-border movement of toxic wastes or illegal migrants,
coordinate activities that will benefit nature preserves, and use debt relief to further
protect tropical forests. United States Government assistance to the region recognizes
the vital link between sustainable use of natural resources and long-term prosperity, a
key to developing prosperous trading partners in this hemisphere.

Promoting Democracy and Human Rights

Latin American nations have made notable advances over the last several years, with the
restoration of democratic institutions in old democracies like Chile and Uruguay, the
consolidation of democratic practices in countries like Nicaragua and Guatemala, and the
move to a competitive democratic system in Mexico where the freest and most
transparent presidential and general elections in the country's history were held in July
2000. Of particular significance has been the growing hemispheric consensus on the
importance of defending democracy when threatened. Through the OAS, the nations of
the Hemisphere have stood firm in support of constitutionally-elected governments under
stress, as in the cases of Ecuador, Guatemala, Paraguay, Haiti, and the Dominican
Republic. In Peru, the OAS is playing a critical role in facilitating democratic reforms that
are expected to lead to free and fair elections in April 2001. We are committed to working
with our partners in the region to further consolidate democratic governance and guard
against democratic reversals.

But our ability to sustain the hemispheric agenda crafted through the Summit of the
Americas process and the OAS depends in part on meeting the challenges posed by
weak democratic institutions, persistently high unemployment and crime rates, and
serious income disparities. In some Latin American countries, citizens will not fully realize
the benefits of political liberalization and economic growth without regulatory, judicial, law
enforcement, and educational reforms, as well as increased efforts to integrate all
members of society into the formal economy.

The hemisphere's leaders are committed to strengthening democracy, justice, and
human rights. They have pledged to intensify efforts to promote democratic reforms at
the regional and local level, protect the rights of migrant workers and their families,
improve the capabilities and competence of civil and criminal justice systems, and
encourage a strong and active civil society. Specific initiatives have included: ratification
of the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption to strengthen the integrity of
governmental institutions; creation of a Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression as
part of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights; and establishment of an Inter-
American Justice Studies Center to facilitate training personnel and exchanging
information, and other forms of technical cooperation to improve judicial systems.

Education is at the centerpiece of reforms aimed at making democracy work for all the
people of the Americas. The Summit Action Plan adopted at Santiago in 1998 seeks to
ensure by the year 2010 primary education for 100% of children and access to quality

secondary education for at least 75% of young people.

We are also seeking to strengthen norms for defense establishments that are supportive
of democracy, transparency, respect for human rights, and civilian control in defense
matters. Through continued engagement with regional security forces and civilian
personnel, facilitated by establishment of the Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies,
our own modest military activities, and presence in the region, we are helping to increase
civilian expertise in defense affairs and reinforce the positive trend in civilian control.

The United States supports the full implementation of enduring political, economic,
security, and judicial reforms in Haiti. Recognizing the severe challenges that confront the
Haitian people, we will continue to provide humanitarian assistance directly to those in
need through non-governmental organizations, while working with civil society and
Haitian authorities to encourage development of sustainable democratic institutions. In
cooperation with the OAS and international financial institutions, we will maintain
pressure on the Haitian regime to adopt credible, free, and fair electoral processes and to

privatize state-owned industries as an incentive to foreign investment. Concerned by the
continued use of Haiti as a transshipment point for illegal drugs entering the United
States, we support the further development of the counterdrug capabilities by the Haitian
National Police as well as modernization and reform of judicial institutions.

The United States remains committed to promoting a peaceful transition to democracy in
Cuba and forestalling a mass exodus that would endanger the lives of migrants and the
security of our borders. While maintaining pressure on the regime to make political and
economic reforms, we continue to encourage the emergence of a civil society to assist
the transition to democracy when the change comes. As the Cuban people feel greater
incentives to take charge of their own future, they are more likely to stay at home and
build the informal and formal structures that will make transition easier. Meanwhile, we
remain firmly committed to bilateral migration accords that ensure migration in a safe,
legal, and orderly manner.

The Middle East, North Africa,
Southwest, and South Asia

Enhancing Security

The United States has enduring interests in pursuing a just, lasting and comprehensive
Middle East peace, ensuring the security and well-being of Israel, helping our Arab
partners provide for their security, and maintaining worldwide access to a critical energy
source. Our strategy reflects those interests and the unique characteristics of the region
as we work to strengthen peace and stability.

The Middle East Peace Process

A historic transformation has taken place in the political landscape of the Middle East
over the last five years. Peace agreements have been reached requiring concerted
implementation efforts, and new agreements are possible which hold out the hope of
ending the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors. The United States -- a key
sponsor of the peace process -- has a clear national interest in seeing the process
deepen and widen. We will continue our steady, determined leadership; standing with
those who take risks for peace, standing against those who would destroy it, lending our
good offices where we can make a difference, and helping bring the concrete benefits of
peace to people's daily lives.

Before the death of Syrian President Assad, Israel and Syria had narrowed their
differences to a remarkable degree. Key differences remained, but the broad features of
an agreement -- and many of its details -- were well established. The United States
remains determined to continue to assist the two sides to find a way to overcome their
final differences and hopeful that we will be able to do so. We also continue to believe
that progress in Israeli-Syrian negotiations will allow progress on negotiations between
Israel and Lebanon, and we will continue to press forward toward that goal.

On the Palestinian front, Israelis and Palestinians are confronting core issues that have
defined their conflict for the past fifty years, seeking to build a lasting peace based on
partnership and cooperation. Although the July 2000 summit at Camp David failed to
achieve a permanent status agreement and violence has recently erupted in the West
Bank and Gaza, the United States will continue its efforts to assist both sides in their

search for a lasting and just peace. Our goal remains the normalization of relations
between Israel and all Arab states. Through the multilateral working groups on security,
refugees, water, and the environment, we are seeking to promote regional cooperation to
address transboundary environmental issues that affect all parties.

North Africa

The United States has an interest in the stability and prosperity of North Africa, a region
that is undergoing important changes. In particular, we are seeking to strengthen our
relations with Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria, and to encourage democratic development
and economic reform. Libya continues to be a country of concern for the national security
and foreign policy interests of the United States. Although the government of Libya has
taken an important positive step away from its support of terrorism by surrendering the
Lockerbie suspects, our policy toward Libya is designed to encourage Libya to
completely cease its support of terrorism and to block its efforts to obtain weapons of
mass destruction.

Southwest Asia

In Southwest Asia, the United States remains focused on deterring threats to regional
stability and energy security, countering threats posed by WMD, and protecting the
security of our regional partners, particularly from the threats posed by Iraq and Iran. We
will continue to encourage members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to work
closely on collective defense and security arrangements, help individual GCC states
meet their defense requirements, and maintain our bilateral defense relationships. For
example, the United States is fostering counterproliferation cooperation with, and among,
the GCC states through the Cooperative Defense Initiative.

We will maintain an appropriate military presence in Southwest Asia using a combination
of ground, air, and naval forces. The terrorist attack on the USS Cole has not deterred
our resolve to maintain a continuous military presence in the Gulf to enhance regional
stability and defend against threats to friendly countries. Our forces in the Gulf are
backed by our ability to rapidly reinforce the region in time of crisis, which we have
demonstrated convincingly. We remain committed to the UN Security Council resolutions
and preventing the Iraqi regime from taking large-scale military action against Kuwait or
the Kurd and Shia minorities in Iraq.

Our policy toward Iraq is comprised of three central elements: containment to prevent
Saddam from again threatening the stability of the vital Gulf region; relief for the Iraqi
people via the UN oil-for-food program; and support to those Iraqis seeking to replace
Saddam's regime with a government that can live at peace with its neighbors and its
people.

Containment of Iraq remains the foundation of our policy toward Saddam Hussein's
regime. Until his government can be removed from power, it must be prevented from
again threatening the region. In December 1999, the United Nations Security Council
passed UNSCR 1284, a new omnibus resolution on Iraq. The United States supports
Resolution 1284 because it buttresses the containment of Iraq while maximizing relief for
the Iraqi people. The resolution expands the humanitarian aspects of the oil-for-food
program to ensure the well being of the Iraqi people. It provides for a robust new
inspection and monitoring regime that would finish the work begun by UNSCOM. It would
allow for a suspension of the economic sanctions in return for full Iraqi cooperation with
UN arms inspections and Iraqi fulfillment of key disarmament tasks. This resolution would

also lock in the Security Council's control over Iraqi finances to ensure that Saddam
Hussein is never again able to disburse Iraq's resources as he would like.

Although Iraq continues to refuse to implement any of the requirements of Resolution
1284, the United States and other members of the Security Council have already begun
to implement those sections of the resolution intended to improve the humanitarian
situation of the Iraqi populace. Iraqi oil exports have increased dramatically, making
possible the procurement of ever-larger quantities of humanitarian necessities. In
addition, the Security Council has greatly expanded the lists of items that Iraq is allowed
to import to include educational supplies, building materials, spare parts for the oil
industry, infrastructure necessities, and other economic goods.

Nevertheless, we consistently maintain that sanctions on Iraq can only be lifted after it
has met its obligations to the international community in full. Saddam's actions over the
past decade lead us to conclude that his regime will never comply with the obligations
contained in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. For this reason, we actively
support those who seek to bring a new democratic government to power in Baghdad. We
recognize that this may be a slow and difficult process, but we believe it is the only
solution to the problem of Saddam's regime.

Our policy toward Iran is aimed at changing the practices of the Iranian government in
several key areas, including its efforts to obtain WMD and long-range missiles, its support
for terrorism and groups that violently oppose the Middle East peace process, and its
human rights practices. We view signs of change in Iranian policies with great interest,
both with regard to the possibility of Iran assuming its rightful place in the world
community and the chance for better bilateral ties. We welcome statements by some
Iranian officials that advocate improved relations with the United States.

These positive signs must be balanced against the reality that Iran's support for terrorism
has not yet ceased and serious violations of human rights persist. Iran is continuing its
efforts to acquire WMD and develop long range missiles (including the 1,300 kilometer-
range Shahab-3 it flight-tested in July 1998, July 2000, and again in September 2000).
The United States will continue to oppose Iranian efforts to sponsor terrorism and to
oppose transfers from any country to Iran of materials and technologies that could be
used to develop long-range missiles or WMD. Additionally, the United States will continue
to work with Arab allies threatened by WMD to develop a defense through efforts such as
the Cooperative Defense Initiative.

The United States has demonstrated that we are ready to explore ways to build mutual
confidence and avoid misunderstandings with Iran. In recognition of the positive changes
in Iran, in particular the fair and free parliamentary elections of February 2000, we
modified our sanctions to allow Iran to export to the United States carpets and foodstuffs
-- key exports for small Iranian businesses and to facilitate people to people contact. We
would welcome reciprocal steps from Iran, and continue to signal our willingness to
engage in an authoritative government-to-government dialogue in which both sides will
be able to discuss their issues of concern.

Meanwhile, we will strengthen our cooperation with allies and friends to encourage
further positive changes in Iranian practices that threaten our shared interests. If a
government-to-government dialogue can be initiated and sustained in a way that
addresses the concerns of both sides, then the United States would be willing to develop
with the Islamic Republic a road map leading to normal relations. It could be useful to
begin a dialogue without preconditions.

South Asia

The President's trip to South Asia in March 2000 reflected the growing importance of the
region to U.S. political, economic, and commercial interests. As the President
emphasized, our strategy for South Asia is designed to help the peoples of that region by
helping resolve long-standing conflicts, encouraging economic development, and
assisting social development. Regional stability and improved bilateral ties are also
important for U.S. economic interests in a region that contains one-fifth of the world's
population and one of its most important emerging markets. In addition, we seek to work
closely with regional countries to stem the flow of illegal drugs from South Asia, most
notably from Afghanistan.

The President stressed the importance we place on reconciliation between India and
Pakistan and our encouragement of direct dialogue between them to resolve all their
outstanding problems. He urged also that they respect the Line of Control in Kashmir,
reject violence as a means to settle their dispute, and exercise mutual restraint.

We seek to establish relationships with India and Pakistan that are defined in terms of
their own individual merits and reflect the full range of U.S. strategic, political and
economic interests in each country. After the President's visit to India, we are working to
enhance our relationship with India at all levels. We look forward to more frequent high-
level contacts including meetings between our heads of government and our cabinet
officials. With Pakistan, a long-standing friend with which we seek improved relations, we
are constrained by the lack of a democratic government since the October 1999 military
coup. We have urged Pakistan's leaders to quickly restore civilian rule and the
democratic process. The President's visit to Islamabad signified our intent to stay
engaged with Pakistan and work to promote that return to democracy.

We seek, as part of our dialogue with India and Pakistan, to encourage both countries to
take steps to prevent further proliferation, reduce the risk of conflict, and exercise
restraint in their nuclear and missile programs. The United States does not believe that
nuclear weapons have made India or Pakistan more secure. We hope they will abandon
their nuclear weapons programs and join the NPT as non-nuclear weapon states. Indian
and Pakistani nuclear and long-range missile tests have been dangerously destabilizing
and threaten to spark a dangerous arms race in South Asia. Such a race will further
undermine the global nonproliferation regime and thus threaten international security.

In concert with the other permanent members of the UN Security Council, the G-8
nations, and many others in the international community, the United States has called on
India and Pakistan to take a number of steps that would bring them closer to the
international mainstream on nonproliferation. These include: signing and ratifying the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, joining the clear international consensus in
support of a cutoff of fissile material production, strengthening export controls, and
refraining from an arms race in nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. We have also
urged them to resume their direct dialogue and take decisive steps to reduce tensions in
South Asia. In that regard, we have urged India and Pakistan to agree to a multilateral
moratorium on the production of fissile material, pending the conclusion of a Fissile
Materials Cutoff Treaty (FIVICT).

Afghanistan remains a serious threat to U.S. worldwide interests because of the Taliban's
continued sheltering of international terrorists and its increasing export of illicit drugs.
Afghanistan remains the primary safehaven for terrorists threatening the United States,
including Usama bin Ladin. The United Nations and the United States have levied
sanctions against the Taliban for harboring Usama bin Ladin and other terrorists, and will

continue to pressure the Taliban until it complies with international requests to bring bin
Ladin to justice. The United States remains concerned about those countries, including
Pakistan, that support the Taliban and allow it to continue to harbor such radical
elements. We are engaged in energetic diplomatic efforts, including through the United
Nations and with Russia and other concerned countries, to address these concerns on an
urgent basis.

Promoting Prosperity

The United States has two principal economic objectives in the region: to promote
regional economic cooperation and development, and to ensure an unrestricted flow of oil
from the region. We seek to promote regional trade and cooperation on infrastructure
through the peace process and our Qualifying Industrial Zone program, which provides
economic benefits for certain countries that enter into business arrangements with Israel.
In South Asia, we will continue to work with the region's countries in their efforts to
implement market reforms, strengthen educational systems, and end the use of child and
sweatshop labor.

Although the United States imports less than 15% of the oil exported from the Persian
Gulf, the region will remain of vital strategic importance to U.S. national security due to
the global nature of the international oil market. Previous oil shocks and the Gulf War
underscore that any blockage of Gulf supplies or sudden changes in price would
immediately affect the international market, driving up energy costs everywhere --
ultimately harming the U.S. economy as well as the economies of our key economic
partners in Europe and Asia. Appropriate responses to events such as Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait can limit the magnitude of a crisis in the Gulf and its impact on world oil markets.
Over the longer term, U.S. dependence on access to these and other foreign oil sources
will remain important as our reserves are depleted. That is one of many important
reasons why the United States must continue to demonstrate commitment and resolve in
the Persian Gulf. We will continue our regular dialogue with the oil-producing nations to
ensure a safe supply of oil and stable prices.

Promoting Democracy and Human Rights

We encourage the spread of democratic values throughout the Middle East, North Africa
and Southwest and South Asia and will pursue this objective aided by constructive
dialogue with countries in the region. In Iran, for example, we hope the nation's leaders
will carry out the people's mandate for a government that respects and protects the rule
of law, both in its internal and external affairs. In Pakistan, we have pressed the new
military rulers to provide a detailed roadmap with a timetable for a return to elected
civilian government. In India, during the President's visit, we supported the establishment
of an Asian Center for Democratic Governance, which would seek to promote the forms
and substance of democracy throughout Asia. We will promote responsible indigenous
moves toward increasing political participation and enhancing the quality of governance,
and we will continue to challenge governments in the region to improve their human
rights records. We will work with the governments and human rights organizations of the
region to promote tolerance for the diverse religious groups present in the Middle East
and South Asia. In particular, we have sought to encourage and end to violence against
minority religious groups, and a repeal of ""blasphemy laws"" which are used to
discriminate against minorities.

Respect for human rights also requires rejection of terrorism. If the nations in the region
are to safeguard their own citizens from the threat of terror, they cannot tolerate acts of

indiscriminate violence against civilians, nor can they offer refuge to those who commit
such acts. We will continue to enforce UNSC sanctions against the Taliban for harboring
terrorists such as Usama bin Ladin and look for other ways to pressure the Taliban to end
its support for such groups.

Our policies are guided by our profound respect for Islam. The Muslim religion is the
fastest-growing faith in the United States. We recognize and honor Islam's role as a
source of inspiration, instruction, and moral guidance for hundreds of millions of people
around the world. United States policy in the region is directed at the actions of
governments and terrorist groups, not peoples or faiths.

Sub-Saharan Africa

In recent years, the United States has engaged in a concerted effort to transform our
relationship with Africa. We have supported efforts by many African nations to move
toward multi-party democracy, hold free and fair elections, promote human rights, allow
freedom of the press and association, enhance civil and judicial institutions, and reform
their economies. A new, post-Cold War political order is emerging in Africa, with
emphasis on democratic and pragmatic approaches to solving political, economic, and
environmental problems, and developing human and natural resources. United States-
Africa ties are deepening, and U.S.-Africa trade is expanding.

Sustaining these recent successes will require that we identify those issues that most
directly affect our interests. We will promote regional stability through engagement with
sub-regional organizations and key African states using carefully harmonized U.S.
programs and initiatives. We recognize and are sensitive to the challenges many African
states face as they move toward multi-party democracy and civil-military relations, and
we will work to focus our limited resources on assisting their transition. Our immediate
objective is to increase the number of capable states in Africa, that is, nations that are
able to define the challenges they face, manage their resources to effectively address
those challenges, and build stability and peace within their borders and their sub-regions.

Enhancing Security

Serious transnational security threats emanate from pockets of Africa, including state-
sponsored terrorism, drug trafficking and other international crime, environmental
degradation, and infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS. Since these threats transcend
state borders, they are best addressed through effective, sustained sub-regional
engagement in Africa. We have already made some progress in countering some of
these threats -- such as by investing in efforts to combat environmental degradation and
infectious disease, and leading international efforts to remove mines planted in previous
conflict areas and halt the proliferation of land mines. We continue efforts to reduce the
flow of illegal drugs through Africa and to curtail international organized criminal activity
based in Africa. We will improve international intelligence sharing, and train and assist
African law enforcement, intelligence, and border control agencies to detect and prevent
planned terrorist attacks against U.S. targets in Africa.

We seek to keep Africa free of weapons of mass destruction by supporting South Africa's
nuclear disarmament and accession to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state,
supporting the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone, and encouraging African nations to
join the BWC and CWC.

Nigeria's rapid change from an autocratic, military regime to a civilian, democratically
elected government has afforded us the opportunity to build a promising security, political
and economic relationship with the most populous country in Africa. With nearly one in
six Africans living in Nigeria, the impact of serious cooperative efforts to tackle significant
drug trafficking, corruption, and other crime could be enormously beneficial to the United
States and a large proportion of Africans. In Sierra Leone, we are working with West
Africa -- particularly Nigeria -- the United Kingdom, and the UN to prevent the spread of
conflict, promote accountability, and deal with the role of diamonds in financing the
rebels. We are also seeking to establish the control of a democratically elected
government over the national territory. Additionally, we are addressing the role of
diamonds and the proliferation of small arms in fueling conflicts in Angola, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, and elsewhere. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
Angola, where fighting threatens to destabilize a broad swath of central and southern
Africa, we are working closely with the region and the UN to support the Lusaka peace
process. Similarly, we have provided significant political support to the Arusha Peace
Process to bring a resolution to the ongoing conflict in Burundi. We have also been
working closely with the UN and Organization for African Unity (OAU) to attempt to
establish a lasting peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

Sudan continues to pose a threat to regional stability and the national security interests of
the United States. We have moved to counter Sudan's support for international terrorism
and regional destabilization by maintaining the sanctions imposed against the Khartoum
regime until it takes concrete, verifiable steps to end support for terrorism on Sudanese
soil; we continue to press for the regime's isolation through the UN Security Council. We
support regional efforts for a just and fair peace and national reconciliation in Sudan
based on the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development's Declaration of Principles.

Persistent conflict and continuing political instability in some African countries remain
obstacles to Africa's development and to our national security, political and economic
interests there, including assured access to oil reserves and other important natural
resources. To foster regional stability and peace in Africa, the United States in 1996
launched the African Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) to train African militaries to
conduct effective peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. It will focus on developing
a sustainable regional capacity to address the multiple challenges to peace and security
on the continent. We are consulting closely on expanded ACRI activity with the UN
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the OAU and its Crisis Management Center,
and African sub-regional organizations already pursuing similar capability enhancements.
A different effort, Operation Focus Relief, is training and equipping seven West African
battalions for peace enforcement missions in Sierra Leone. And finally, another initiative,
the Enhanced International Peacekeeping Capabilities (EIPC) program, provides funding
to upgrade peacekeeping and training centers, and ""train the trainer’ in countries around
the world in order to make them more interoperable with U.S. and other peacekeeping
forces, thereby sharing the burden.

The United States has established the Africa Center for Strategic Studies (ACSS) to
promote the exchange of ideas and information tailored specifically for African security
concerns. The goal is for ACSS to be a source of academic, yet practical, instruction in
promoting civil-military relations and the skills necessary to make effective national
security decisions in democratic governments. The curriculum will engage African military
and civilian defense leaders in a substantive dialogue about defense policy planning,
civil-military relations, and defense resource management in democracies. Our long-term
goal is to support the development of regional security arrangements and institutions to
prevent and manage armed conflicts and curtail transnational threats to our collective
security.

Promoting Prosperity

A stable, democratic, prosperous Africa will be a better economic partner, a better partner
for security and peace, and a better partner in the fights against drug trafficking, crime,
terrorism, infectious diseases, and environmental degradation. Lasting prosperity for
Africa will be possible only when Africa is fully integrated into the global economy.

Further integrating Africa into the global economy will also directly serve U.S. interests by
continuing to expand an already important new market for U.S. exports. The
approximately 700 million people of sub-Saharan Africa represent one of the world's
largest basically untapped markets. Although the United States enjoys only a 7% market
share in Africa, already 100,000 American jobs depend on our exports there. Increasing
both the U.S. market share and the size of the African market will bring tangible benefits
to U.S. workers and increase prosperity and economic opportunity in Africa. Our aim,
therefore, is to assist African nations to implement economic reforms, improve public
governance and combat corruption, create favorable climates for trade and investment,
and achieve sustainable development.

To support the economic transformation underway in Africa, the President in June 1997
launched the Partnership for Economic Growth and Opportunity in Africa Initiative. The
Administration has implemented many of the Initiative's objectives and continues to work
closely with Congress to implement remaining key elements of this initiative. The
enactment of the African Growth and Opportunity Act on May 18, 2000 marked the
beginning of a new relationship between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa. This
legislation provides the opportunity for substantial preferential market access to the U.S.
market for eligible sub-Saharan African countries, and provides an economic, human
rights, and civil-judicial benchmark towards which current non-eligible countries can
aspire and focus their development efforts.

By significantly broadening market access, spurring growth, and helping the poorest
nations eliminate or reduce their bilateral debt, the Initiative and the legislation better
enable us to help African nations undertake difficult economic reforms and build better
lives for their people through sustainable development. We are working with African
governments on shared interests in the world trading system, such as developing
electronic commerce, improving WTO capacity-building functions, and eliminating
agricultural export subsidies. We also are pursuing initiatives to encourage U.S. trade
with and investment in Africa, including targeted technical assistance, enhanced debt
forgiveness, and increased bilateral trade ties.

To further our trade objectives in Africa, the Ron Brown Commercial Center was
established in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1998. The Center provides support for
American companies looking to enter or expand into the sub-Saharan African market,
promotes U.S. exports through a range of support programs, and facilitates business
contacts and partnerships between African and American businesses. The President's
historic March 1998 trip to Africa and the unprecedented March 1999 U.S.-Africa
Ministerial further solidified our partnership with African nations across a range of
security, economic, and political issues.

Helping Africans generate the food and income necessary to feed themselves is critical
for promoting sustainable growth and development. Despite some recent progress, the
percentage of malnourished people and lack of diversified sustainable agricultural
production in Africa is the highest of any region in the world, and more help is greatly
needed. In 1998 we launched the Africa Food Security Initiative (AFSI), a USAID-led
effort to help improve agricultural productivity, support research, expand income-

generating projects, and address nutritional needs for the rural poor. While maintaining its
program focus in the original AFSI countries -- Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Malawi, and
Uganda -- the initiative is now being expanded into countries where food security is
declining, such as Tanzania and Zambia, as well as Ghana and Kenya, where we can
build on other USAID programs to accelerate our goals of improved child nutrition and
increased agricultural incomes.

The initial focus under the AFSI involved countries that were either on the fast growth
track or countries that had undertaken a degree of structural adjustment that would put
them on the right path. Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Malawi, and Uganda, the initial focus
countries, have performed reasonably well under the circumstances. Productivity and
agriculture incomes had been rising before the floods in southern Africa or the drought in
East Africa. All of these countries either met or exceeded their performance targets last
year. Food grants production per capita, one of the Initiative's objectives, has continued
its upward trend last year. Of these countries, all except Ethiopia -- whose war with
Eritrea has continued during this period -- are showing improving food security trends.

However, the picture is less encouraging in much of Africa. Malnutrition accounts for
about one-third of all children's deaths in Africa. And although there has been a decline in
the percentage of preschoolers in Africa who are stunted, the number is going up -- the
only place in the world where this is the case -- from about 35 million in 1980 to a
projection of 50 million in 2005.

The Africa Food Security Initiative, while maintaining its program focus in the original
AFSI countries, is expanding its program into countries where food security is declining,
such as Tanzania and Zambia, as well as Ghana and Kenya, where we can build on
USAID program to accelerate our goals of improved child nutrition and increased
agriculture incomes.

USAID has been able to make progress on the Initiative by focusing on working with
governments to improve agricultural policies, working with farmers and researchers to
increase the technologies that allow for yield increases (or cut production costs), and
working with farmer groups to improve their ability to market their produce more
competitively. We are also working closely with African partners to make available usable
technologies such as air traffic control systems and other airfield improvements, as well
as introducing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to provide training and demonstration
projects.

African nations are also engaged in battle with age-old diseases, such as malaria and
tuberculosis (TB), which sap economic productivity and development. Worse, the
epidemic of HIV/AIDS is devastating the continent, reversing hard-fought gains in
development, dramatically reducing life expectancy, decreasing GDPs, and threatening
security and stability in the hardest-hit nations. The Administration has made the battle
against AIDS and other diseases a priority for international action and investment in
Africa. Over the past two years, the President has doubled bilateral assistance for the
fight against HIV/AIDS, launched the Millennium Vaccine Initiative to accelerate the
search for vaccines against HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB, and launched a campaign to
mobilize new resources from other donors, such as the G-8, and the private sector. We
have also begun the Leadership in Fighting an Epidemic (LIFE) initiative, a $100 million
effort with legislative backing, which focuses on training and prevention activities for
selected sub-Saharan African militaries.

Promoting Democracy and Human Rights

In Africa as elsewhere, democracies have proved to be stronger partners for peace,
stability and sustained prosperity. We will continue to support the important progress
African nations have achieved and to broaden the growing circle of African democracies.

The restoration of civilian democratic government in Nigeria can help return that country
to its place as a leader in Africa. The government and people of Nigeria have succeeded
in restoring democratic civilian government, freed political prisoners, lifted onerous
restrictions on labor unions, and worked to restore the authority of the judicial system.
Nigeria's new civilian government has taken sweeping steps to ensure that the military
remains in the barracks and that fighting corruption will be a top priority. The peaceful
elections in February 1999 and inauguration of the new civilian government in May 1999
were important steps in this transformation.

As in any democratic transition, Nigeria's new government is facing enormous
challenges: creating accountable government, building support within the military for
civilian rule, protecting human rights, and rebuilding the economy so it benefits all
citizens. President Clinton met with President Obasanjo at the White House in October
1999 and again in Nigeria in August 2000. The discussions reaffirmed our nation's
commitment to work with him on the security, economic, political, and social challenges
faced by Nigeria. Kenya, which has played a critical role in maintaining regional stability,
is also facing an historic transition. President Daniel Moi has announced that he will step
down in 2002, after twenty-four years in power. He leaves a country that is suffering from
a weak economy and deteriorating social infrastructure. We must continue to actively
engage the Government of Kenya on such matters as conflict resolution, regional
stability, and economic development as well as encouraging commitment to constitutional
reform and human rights.

Democracy assistance has proven to be an effective tool in both Senegal and Zimbabwe.
In Senegal, President Abdou Diouf accepted defeat in the March elections and turned
power over peacefully to Abdoulaye Wade, the opposition leader. The most recent
elections had a record high voter turnout of educated voters despite several complicating
factors. In order to help post-apartheid South Africa achieve its economic, political,
democratic, and security goals for all its citizens, we will continue to provide substantial
bilateral assistance, vigorously promote U.S. trade and investment, and pursue close
cooperation and support for our mutual interests.

Ultimately, the prosperity and security of Africa depend on African leadership, strong
national institutions, and extensive political and economic reform. The United States will
continue to support and promote such national reforms and the evolution of regional
arrangements that build cooperation among African states.

IV. Conclusions

Over the last eight years, we have once again mustered the creative energies of our
Nation to reestablish the United States' military and economic strength within the world
community. This leadership position has been achieved in a manner in which our
forefathers would likely have been pleased; a nation leading by the authority that comes
from the attractiveness of its values and force of its example, rather than the power of its
military might to compel by force or sanction. As a result, the world now looks to the
United States to be not just a broker of peace, but a catalyst of coalitions, anda
guarantor of global financial stability. It has been achieved in spite of a period of
tumultuous change in the strategic landscape. Yet, it has been realized because we have
maintained a steadfast focus on simple goals -- peace, shared prosperity, and freedom --
that lift the condition of all nations and people that choose to join us.

Our strategy for engagement is comprised of many different policies, the key elements of
which include:

+ Adapting our alliances
+ Encouraging the reorientation of other states, including former adversaries

* Encouraging democratization, open markets, free trade, and sustainable
development

+ Preventing conflict

* Countering potential regional aggressors

* Confronting new threats

* Steering international peace and stability operations.

These elements are building blocks within a strategic architecture that describe a foreign
policy for a global age. They are not easily summed up in a single phrase but they have
all been guided by two simple principles -- protecting our interests and advancing our
values. Together, the sum of these goals, elements, and principles represent the
blueprint for our strategy of engagement, and we believe that strategy will best achieve
our vision for the future.

But we must not be too sanguine about the future. New challenges to the sustainability of
our current economic, political, and national security successes will arise. The true
question is what will best ensure our leadership in the years ahead. It took great vision
almost a decade ago to realize that strength abroad would depend not only on
maintaining an internationalist philosophy but also on reestablishing strength at home.
Putting our economic house in order, while not retreating into isolationism proved a wise
course and validated the mutual linkage between disparate goals of peace, shared
prosperity, and democracy. Any other policy choice might well have permitted the world
to fall into a series of regional conflicts in the aftermath of the Cold War and possibly
have precluded opportunity for the U.S. economic recovery of the 1990s. Although past is
not necessarily prologue, the inexorable trend of globalization supports the continued
viability of a strategy of engagement. We must not, in reaction to the real or perceived

costs of engagement, retreat into a policy of ""Fortress America."" To do so would lead us
down a path that would dishonor our commitments, ignore our friends, and discount belief
in our values. The result would be a global loss of our authority and with it ultimately our
power. A strategy of engagement, however, is the surest way to enhance not only our
power but also our authority, and thus our leadership, into the 21st century.

THE WHITE HOUSE
WASHINGTON

The great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a
decisive victory for the forces of freedom—and a single sustainable model for national success:
freedom, democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only nations that share a
commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic
freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity.
People everywhere want to be able to speak freely; choose who will govern them; worship as they
please; educate their children—male and female; own property; and enjoy the benefits of their
labor. These values of freedom are right and true for every person, in every society—and the
duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedom-loving

people across the globe and across the ages.

Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic
and political influence. In keeping with our heritage and principles, we do not use our strength
to press for unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human
freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards
and challenges of political and economic liberty. In a world that is safe, people will be able to
make their own lives better. We will defend the peace by fighting terrorists and tyrants. We will
preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the peace

by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.

Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the
Federal Government. Today, that task has changed dramatically. Enemies in the past needed
great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of
individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase
a single tank. Terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of

modern technologies against us.

To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal—military power, better
homeland defenses, law enforcement, intelligence, and vigorous efforts to cut off terrorist
financing. The war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration.

America will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will hold

to account nations that are compromised by terror, including those who harbor terrorists—
because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and countries
cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases. Together, we will

seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn.

The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology. Our
enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction, and evidence
indicates that they are doing so with determination. The United States will not allow these
efforts to succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery.
We will cooperate with other nations to deny, contain, and curtail our enemies’ efforts to acquire
dangerous technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America will act
against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We cannot defend America and our
friends by hoping for the best. So we must be prepared to defeat our enemies’ plans, using the
best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who saw this
coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have entered, the only path to peace and

security is the path of action.

As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the
peace. Today, the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state
in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of
continually prepare for war. Today, the world’s great powers find ourselves on the same side—
united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos. The United States will build on
these common interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by common
values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching for its democratic future and a
partner in the war on terror. Chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only
source of national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political freedom is the only
source of national greatness. America will encourage the advancement of democracy and
economic openness in both nations, because these are the best foundations for domestic stability
and international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great powers—even as we

welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, trade, and cultural advancement.

Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom
across the globe. We will actively work to bring the hope of democracy, development, free
markets, and free trade to every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught
us that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our national interests as
strong states. Poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty,
weak institutions, and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and

drug cartels within their borders.

The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking
the rewards of liberty for its people. Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift
whole societies out of poverty—so the United States will work with individual nations, entire
regions, and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and
therefore grows in prosperity. The United States will deliver greater development assistance
through the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, invest in their
people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also continue to lead the world in efforts to
reduce the terrible toll of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.

In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is guided by the conviction
that all nations have important responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight
terror. Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons
of mass destruction. Nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely, so that

aid is well spent. For freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.

We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, better world alone.
Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedom-loving nations.
The United States is committed to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade
Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as other long-standing
alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions. In all cases,
international obligations are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically

to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.

Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of every person—in
every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has been threatened by war and terror; it has
been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and it
has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity holds in its hands the
opportunity to further freedom’s triumph over all these foes. The United States welcomes our

responsibility to lead in this great mission.

I. OVERVIEW OF AMERICA’S

INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY

“Our Nation’s cause has always been larger than our Nation’s defense.

We fight, as we always fight, for a just peace—a peace that favors liberty.

We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants.

We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers.

And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.”

PRESIDENT BusH
WEsT Point, NEw YORK
JUNE 1, 2002

The United States possesses unprecedented—
and unequaled—strength and influence in the
world. Sustained by faith in the principles of
liberty, and the value of a free society, this position
comes with unparalleled responsibilities, obliga-
tions, and opportunity. The great strength of this
nation must be used to promote a balance of
power that favors freedom.

For most of the twentieth century, the world
was divided by a great struggle over ideas: destruc-
tive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality.

That great struggle is over. The militant visions
of class, nation, and race which promised utopia
and delivered misery have been defeated and
discredited. America is now threatened less by
conquering states than we are by failing ones.

We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by
catastrophic technologies in the hands of the
embittered few. We must defeat these threats to
our Nation, allies, and friends.

This is also a time of opportunity for America.
We will work to translate this moment of influ-
ence into decades of peace, prosperity, and liberty.

The U.S. national security strategy will be based
on a distinctly American internationalism that
reflects the union of our values and our national
interests. The aim of this strategy is to help make
the world not just safer but better. Our goals on
the path to progress are clear: political and
economic freedom, peaceful relations with other
states, and respect for human dignity.

And this path is not America’s alone. It is open
to all.

To achieve these goals, the United States will:
+ champion aspirations for human dignity;

* strengthen alliances to defeat global
terrorism and work to prevent attacks
against us and our friends;

+ work with others to defuse regional conflicts;

* prevent our enemies from threatening us,
our allies, and our friends, with weapons of
mass destruction;

* ignite a new era of global economic growth
through free markets and free trade;

 

National Security Strategy 1

 

* expand the circle of development by
opening societies and building the
infrastructure of democracy;

+ develop agendas for cooperative action with
other main centers of global power; and

* transform America’s national security
institutions to meet the challenges and
opportunities of the twenty-first century.

11. CHAMPION ASPIRATIONS FOR HUMAN DIGNITY

“Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to

speak the language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances

require different methods, but not different moralities.”

PRESIDENT BUSH
WEsT Point, NEw YORK
JUNE 1, 2002

In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is
to clarify what we stand for: the United States
must defend liberty and justice because these
principles are right and true for all people every-
where. No nation owns these aspirations, and no
nation is exempt from them. Fathers and mothers
in all societies want their children to be educated
and to live free from poverty and violence. No
people on earth yearn to be oppressed, aspire to
servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of
the secret police.

America must stand firmly for the nonnego-
tiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law;
limits on the absolute power of the state; free
speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect
for women; religious and ethnic tolerance; and
respect for private property.

These demands can be met in many ways.
America’s constitution has served us well.
Many other nations, with different histories and
cultures, facing different circumstances, have
successfully incorporated these core principles
into their own systems of governance. History has
not been kind to those nations which ignored or
flouted the rights and aspirations of their people.

America’s experience as a great multi-ethnic
democracy affirms our conviction that people of
many heritages and faiths can live and prosper in
peace. Our own history is a long struggle to live
up to our ideals. But even in our worst moments,
the principles enshrined in the Declaration of
Independence were there to guide us. As a result,
America is not just a stronger, but is a freer and
more just society.

Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely
defenders of liberty. And when openings arrive,
we can encourage change—as we did in central
and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991,
or in Belgrade in 2000. When we see democratic
processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan
or in the Republic of Korea, and see elected
leaders replace generals in Latin America and
Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian
systems can evolve, marrying local history and
traditions with the principles we all cherish.

Embodying lessons from our past and using
the opportunity we have today, the national security
strategy of the United States must start from these
core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to
expand liberty.

Ill. STRENGTHEN ALLIANCES TO DEFEAT

GLOBAL TERRORISM AND WORK TO PREVENT

ATTACKS AGAINST US AND OuR FRIENDS

“Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have

the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already clear:

to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been

waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is peaceful,

but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on the timing and terms

of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of our choosing.”

PRESIDENT BusH
WASHINGTON, D.C. (THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL)
SEPTEMBER 14, 2001

The United States of America is fighting
a war against terrorists of global reach. The
enemy is not a single political regime or person
or religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism—
premeditated, politically motivated violence
perpetrated against innocents.

In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent
the emergence of a lasting peace. Such grievances
deserve to be, and must be, addressed within a
political process. But no cause justifies terror. The
United States will make no concessions to terrorist
demands and strike no deals with them. We make
no distinction between terrorists and those who
knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.

The struggle against global terrorism is different
from any other war in our history. It will be fought
on many fronts against a particularly elusive
enemy over an extended period of time. Progress

will come through the persistent accumulation of
successes—some seen, some unseen.

Today our enemies have seen the results of
what civilized nations can, and will, do against
regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to
achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been
liberated; coalition forces continue to hunt down
the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not only this
battlefield on which we will engage terrorists.
Thousands of trained terrorists remain at large
with cells in North America, South America,
Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.

Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy
terrorist organizations of global reach and attack
their leadership; command, control, and commu-
nications; material support; and finances. This will
have a disabling effect upon the terrorists’ ability
to plan and operate.

 

National Security Strategy 5

 

We will continue to encourage our regional
partners to take up a coordinated effort that
isolates the terrorists. Once the regional campaign
localizes the threat to a particular state, we will
help ensure the state has the military, law enforce-
ment, political, and financial tools necessary to
finish the task.

The United States will continue to work with
our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism. We
will identify and block the sources of funding for
terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those
who support them, deny terrorists access to the
international financial system, protect legitimate
charities from being abused by terrorists, and
prevent the movement of terrorists’ assets through
alternative financial networks.

However, this campaign need not be sequential
to be effective, the cumulative effect across all
regions will help achieve the results we seek.

We will disrupt and destroy terrorist
organizations by:

+ direct and continuous action using all the
elements of national and international
power. Our immediate focus will be those
terrorist organizations of global reach and
any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism
which attempts to gain or use weapons of
mass destruction (WMD) or their precursors;

+ defending the United States, the American
people, and our interests at home and
abroad by identifying and destroying the
threat before it reaches our borders. While
the United States will constantly strive to
enlist the support of the international
community, we will not hesitate to act alone,
if necessary, to exercise our right of self-
defense by acting preemptively against such
terrorists, to prevent them from doing harm
against our people and our country; and

 

+ denying further sponsorship, support,
and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing
or compelling states to accept their
sovereign responsibilities.

We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle
against international terrorism. This includes:

* using the full influence of the United States,
and working closely with allies and friends,
to make clear that all acts of terrorism are
illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed
in the same light as slavery, piracy, or
genocide: behavior that no respectable
government can condone or support and
all must oppose;

* supporting moderate and modern
government, especially in the Muslim
world, to ensure that the conditions and
ideologies that promote terrorism do not
find fertile ground in any nation;

+ diminishing the underlying conditions
that spawn terrorism by enlisting the
international community to focus its efforts
and resources on areas most at risk; and

* using effective public diplomacy to promote
the free flow of information and ideas to
kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom
of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of
global terrorism.

While we recognize that our best defense is a
good offense, we are also strengthening America’s
homeland security to protect against and deter attack.

This Administration has proposed the largest
government reorganization since the Truman
Administration created the National Security
Council and the Department of Defense. Centered
on a new Department of Homeland Security and
including a new unified military command and a
fundamental reordering of the FBI, our compre-
hensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses
every level of government and the cooperation
of the public and the private sector.

This strategy will turn adversity into
opportunity. For example, emergency management
systems will be better able to cope not just with
terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical
system will be strengthened to manage not just

 

6 National Security Strategy

 

bioterror, but all infectious diseases and
mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will
not just stop terrorists, but improve the efficient
movement of legitimate traffic.

While our focus is protecting America, we
know that to defeat terrorism in today’s globalized
world we need support from our allies and
friends. Wherever possible, the United States will
rely on regional organizations and state powers to
meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where
governments find the fight against terrorism
beyond their capacities, we will match their
willpower and their resources with whatever help
we and our allies can provide.

As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan,
we will continue to work with international

organizations such as the United Nations, as well
as non-governmental organizations, and other
countries to provide the humanitarian, political,
economic, and security assistance necessary to
rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again
abuse its people, threaten its neighbors, and
provide a haven for terrorists.

In the war against global terrorism, we will
never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our
democratic values and way of life. Freedom and
fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy
end to this conflict. In leading the campaign
against terrorism, we are forging new, productive
international relationships and redefining existing
ones in ways that meet the challenges of the
twenty-first century.

 

National Security Strategy 7

 

Iv. WORK WITH OTHERS TO

DEFUSE REGIONAL CONFLICTS

“We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion.

The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small.”

PRESIDENT BusH

BERLIN, GERMANY

May 23, 2002

Concerned nations must remain actively
engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid
explosive escalation and minimize human
suffering. In an increasingly interconnected world,
regional crisis can strain our alliances, rekindle
rivalries among the major powers, and create
horrifying affronts to human dignity. When
violence erupts and states falter, the United States
will work with friends and partners to alleviate
suffering and restore stability.

No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance
in which U.S. action—direct or indirect—is
warranted. We have finite political, economic, and
military resources to meet our global priorities.
The United States will approach each case with
these strategic principles in mind:

* The United States should invest time and
resources into building international rela-
tionships and institutions that can help
manage local crises when they emerge.

* The United States should be realistic about
its ability to help those who are unwilling or
unready to help themselves. Where and
when people are ready to do their part, we
will be willing to move decisively.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical
because of the toll of human suffering, because of
America’s close relationship with the state of Israel
and key Arab states, and because of that region’s
importance to other global priorities of the United
States. There can be no peace for either side
without freedom for both sides. America stands
committed to an independent and democratic
Palestine, living beside Israel in peace and security.
Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a
government that serves their interests and listens
to their voices. The United States will continue
to encourage all parties to step up to their respon-
sibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive
settlement to the conflict.

The United States, the international donor
community, and the World Bank stand ready to
work with a reformed Palestinian government on
economic development, increased humanitarian
assistance, and a program to establish, finance,
and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If
Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of
law, confront corruption, and firmly reject terror,
they can count on American support for the
creation of a Palestinian state.

 

National Security Strategy 9

 

Israel also has a large stake in the success of a
democratic Palestine. Permanent occupation
threatens Israel’s identity and democracy. So the
United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders
to take concrete steps to support the emergence of
a viable, credible Palestinian state. As there is
progress towards security, Israel forces need to
withdraw fully to positions they held prior to
September 28, 2000. And consistent with the
recommendations of the Mitchell Committee,
Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territo-
ries must stop. As violence subsides, freedom of
movement should be restored, permitting inno-
cent Palestinians to resume work and normal life.
The United States can play a crucial role but,
ultimately, lasting peace can only come when
Israelis and Palestinians resolve the issues and end
the conflict between them.

In South Asia, the United States has also
emphasized the need for India and Pakistan to
resolve their disputes. This Administration
invested time and resources building strong
bilateral relations with India and Pakistan.

These strong relations then gave us leverage to
play a constructive role when tensions in the
region became acute. With Pakistan, our bilateral
relations have been bolstered by Pakistan’s choice
to join the war against terror and move toward
building a more open and tolerant society. The
Administration sees India’s potential to become
one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-
first century and has worked hard to transform
our relationship accordingly. Our involvement in
this regional dispute, building on earlier invest-
ments in bilateral relations, looks first to concrete
steps by India and Pakistan that can help defuse
military confrontation.

Indonesia took courageous steps to create a
working democracy and respect for the rule of law.
By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting the rule
of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may
be able to employ the engine of opportunity that
has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty
and desperation. It is the initiative by Indonesia that
allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.

In the Western Hemisphere we have formed
flexible coalitions with countries that share our
priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, Canada,
Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a
truly democratic hemisphere where our integra-
tion advances security, prosperity, opportunity,
and hope. We will work with regional institutions,
such as the Summit of the Americas process, the
Organization of American States (OAS), and the
Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit
of the entire hemisphere.

Parts of Latin America confront regional
conflict, especially arising from the violence of
drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict
and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could
imperil the health and security of the United
States. Therefore we have developed an active
strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their
economies, enforce their laws, defeat terrorist
organizations, and cut off the supply of drugs,
while—as important—we work to reduce the
demand for drugs in our own country.

In Colombia, we recognize the link between
terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the
security of the state and drug trafficking activities
that help finance the operations of such groups.
We are working to help Colombia defend its
democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed
groups of both the left and right by extending
effective sovereignty over the entire national
territory and provide basic security to the
Colombian people.

In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by
side with disease, war, and desperate poverty. This
threatens both a core value of the United States—
preserving human dignity—and our strategic
priority—combating global terror. American
interests and American principles, therefore, lead
in the same direction: we will work with others for
an African continent that lives in liberty, peace,
and growing prosperity. Together with our
European allies, we must help strengthen Africa’s
fragile states, help build indigenous capability to
secure porous borders, and help build up the law

 

10 National Security Strategy

 

enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to
deny havens for terrorists.

An ever more lethal environment exists in
Africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to
create regional war zones. Forming coalitions of
the willing and cooperative security arrangements
are key to confronting these emerging transna-
tional threats.

Africa’s great size and diversity requires a
security strategy that focuses on bilateral engage-
ment and builds coalitions of the willing. This
Administration will focus on three interlocking
strategies for the region:

* countries with major impact on their
neighborhood such as South Africa, Nigeria,
Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional
engagement and require focused attention;

* coordination with European allies and
international institutions is essential for
constructive conflict mediation and
successful peace operations; and

+ Africa’s capable reforming states and
sub-regional organizations must be strength-
ened as the primary means to address
transnational threats on a sustained basis.

Ultimately the path of political and economic
freedom presents the surest route to progress in
sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are conflicts
over material resources and political access often
tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and
religious difference. The transition to the African
Union with its stated commitment to good
governance and a common responsibility for
democratic political systems offers opportunities
to strengthen democracy on the continent.

v. PREVENT OuR ENEMIES FROM THREATENING Us,

Our ALLIES, AND OuR FRIENDS

WITH WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

“The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology.

When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons,

along with ballistic missile technology—when that occurs, even weak states

and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations.

Our enemies have declared this very intention, and have been caught seeking

these terrible weapons. They want the capability to blackmail us, or to harm us,

or to harm our friends—and we will oppose them with all our power.”

PRESIDENT BusH

WEsT Point, NEw YORK

JUNE 1, 2002

The nature of the Cold War threat required the
United States—with our allies and friends—to
emphasize deterrence of the enemy’s use of force,
producing a grim strategy of mutual assured
destruction. With the collapse of the Soviet Union
and the end of the Cold War, our security envi-
ronment has undergone profound transformation.

Having moved from confrontation to coopera-
tion as the hallmark of our relationship with Russia,
the dividends are evident: an end to the balance of
terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the
nuclear arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in
areas such as counterterrorism and missile defense
that until recently were inconceivable.

But new deadly challenges have emerged from
rogue states and terrorists. None of these contem-
porary threats rival the sheer destructive power
that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union.
However, the nature and motivations of these new
adversaries, their determination to obtain destruc-
tive powers hitherto available only to the world’s
strongest states, and the greater likelihood that
they will use weapons of mass destruction against
us, make today’s security environment more
complex and dangerous.

In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a
small number of rogue states that, while different
in important ways, share a number of attributes.
These states:

 

National Security Strategy 13

 

+ brutalize their own people and squander Our comprehensive strategy to combat

their national resources for the personal gain = WMD includes:

of the rulers;

+ display no regard for international law,
threaten their neighbors, and callously
violate international treaties to which they
are party;

* are determined to acquire weapons of mass
destruction, along with other advanced
military technology, to be used as threats or
offensively to achieve the aggressive designs
of these regimes;

* sponsor terrorism around the globe; and

* reject basic human values and hate the United
States and everything for which it stands.

At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired
irrefutable proof that Iraq’s designs were not
limited to the chemical weapons it had used
against Iran and its own people, but also extended
to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and biolog-
ical agents. In the past decade North Korea has
become the world’s principal purveyor of ballistic
missiles, and has tested increasingly capable
missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal.
Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and
chemical weapons as well. These states’ pursuit of,
and global trade in, such weapons has become a
looming threat to all nations.

We must be prepared to stop rogue states and
their terrorist clients before they are able to
threaten or use weapons of mass destruction
against the United States and our allies and
friends. Our response must take full advantage of
strengthened alliances, the establishment of new
partnerships with former adversaries, innovation
in the use of military forces, modern technologies,
including the development of an effective missile
defense system, and increased emphasis on
intelligence collection and analysis.

Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We
must deter and defend against the threat
before it is unleashed. We must ensure that
key capabilities—detection, active and
passive defenses, and counterforce
capabilities—are integrated into our defense
transformation and our homeland security
systems. Counterproliferation must also be
integrated into the doctrine, training, and
equipping of our forces and those of our
allies to ensure that we can prevail in any
conflict with WMD-armed adversaries.

Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to
prevent rogue states and terrorists from
acquiring the materials, technologies, and
expertise necessary for weapons of mass
destruction. We will enhance diplomacy,
arms control, multilateral export controls,
and threat reduction assistance that impede
states and terrorists seeking WMD, and
when necessary, interdict enabling technolo-
gies and materials. We will continue to build
coalitions to support these efforts, encour-
aging their increased political and financial
support for nonproliferation and threat
reduction programs. The recent G-8
agreement to commit up to $20 billion to a
global partnership against proliferation
marks a major step forward.

Effective consequence management to respond
to the effects of WMD use, whether by terror-
ists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of
WMD use against our people will help deter
those who possess such weapons and
dissuade those who seek to acquire them by
persuading enemies that they cannot attain
their desired ends. The United States must
also be prepared to respond to the effects of
WMD use against our forces abroad, and to
help friends and allies if they are attacked.

 

14 National Security Strategy

 

It has taken almost a decade for us to
comprehend the true nature of this new threat.
Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the
United States can no longer solely rely on a reac-
tive posture as we have in the past. The inability
to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy of
today’s threats, and the magnitude of potential
harm that could be caused by our adversaries’
choice of weapons, do not permit that option. We
cannot let our enemies strike first.

+ In the Cold War, especially following the
Cuban missile crisis, we faced a generally
status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence
was an effective defense. But deterrence
based only upon the threat of retaliation is
less likely to work against leaders of rogue
states more willing to take risks, gambling
with the lives of their people, and the wealth
of their nations.

* In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruc-
tion were considered weapons of last resort
whose use risked the destruction of those
who used them. Today, our enemies see
weapons of mass destruction as weapons of
choice. For rogue states these weapons are
tools of intimidation and military aggression
against their neighbors. These weapons may
also allow these states to attempt to black-
mail the United States and our allies to
prevent us from deterring or repelling the
aggressive behavior of rogue states. Such
states also see these weapons as their best
means of overcoming the conventional
superiority of the United States.

* Traditional concepts of deterrence will not
work against a terrorist enemy whose
avowed tactics are wanton destruction and
the targeting of innocents; whose so-called
soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose
most potent protection is statelessness. The
overlap between states that sponsor terror and
those that pursue WMD compels us to action.

For centuries, international law recognized that
nations need not suffer an attack before they can
lawfully take action to defend themselves against
forces that present an imminent danger of attack.
Legal scholars and international jurists often
conditioned the legitimacy of preemption on the
existence of an imminent threat—most often a
visible mobilization of armies, navies, and air
forces preparing to attack.

We must adapt the concept of imminent
threat to the capabilities and objectives of today’s
adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not
seek to attack us using conventional means.
They know such attacks would fail. Instead, they
rely on acts of terror and, potentially, the use of
weapons of mass destruction—weapons that can
be easily concealed, delivered covertly, and used
without warning.

The targets of these attacks are our military
forces and our civilian population, in direct viola-
tion of one of the principal norms of the law of
warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on
September 11, 2001, mass civilian casualties is the
specific objective of terrorists and these losses
would be exponentially more severe if terrorists
acquired and used weapons of mass destruction.

The United States has long maintained the
option of preemptive actions to counter a suffi-
cient threat to our national security. The greater
the threat, the greater is the risk of inaction—
and the more compelling the case for taking
anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if
uncertainty remains as to the time and place of
the enemy’s attack. To forestall or prevent such
hostile acts by our adversaries, the United States
will, if necessary, act preemptively.

The United States will not use force in all cases
to preempt emerging threats, nor should nations
use preemption as a pretext for aggression. Yet in
an age where the enemies of civilization openly
and actively seek the world’s most destructive
technologies, the United States cannot remain idle
while dangers gather.

 

National Security Strategy 15

 

We will always proceed deliberately, weighing
the consequences of our actions. To support
preemptive options, we will:

* build better, more integrated intelligence
capabilities to provide timely, accurate infor-
mation on threats, wherever they may emerge;

* coordinate closely with allies to form a
common assessment of the most dangerous
threats; and

* continue to transform our military forces to
ensure our ability to conduct rapid and
precise operations to achieve decisive results.

The purpose of our actions will always be to
eliminate a specific threat to the United States or
our allies and friends. The reasons for our actions
will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.

vi. IGNITE A NEw ERA OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC

GROWTH THROUGH FREE MARKETS AND FREE TRADE

“When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a

privileged few, no amount—no amount—of development aid is ever enough.

When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in better

health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of

trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.”

PRESIDENT BusH
Monterrey, MExIco
MARCH 22, 2002

A strong world economy enhances our national
security by advancing prosperity and freedom in
the rest of the world. Economic growth supported
by free trade and free markets creates new jobs
and higher incomes. It allows people to lift their
lives out of poverty, spurs economic and legal
reform, and the fight against corruption, and it
reinforces the habits of liberty.

We will promote economic growth and
economic freedom beyond America’s shores. All
governments are responsible for creating their
own economic policies and responding to their
own economic challenges. We will use our
economic engagement with other countries to
underscore the benefits of policies that generate
higher productivity and sustained economic
growth, including:

* pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to
encourage business investment, innovation,
and entrepreneurial activity;

* tax policies—particularly lower marginal tax
rates—that improve incentives for work and
investment;

+ rule of law and intolerance of corruption so
that people are confident that they will be
able to enjoy the fruits of their economic
endeavors;

* strong financial systems that allow capital to
be put to its most efficient use;

* sound fiscal policies to support business
activity;

* investments in health and education that
improve the well-being and skills of the
labor force and population as a whole; and

* free trade that provides new avenues for
growth and fosters the diffusion of technolo-
gies and ideas that increase productivity
and opportunity.

The lessons of history are clear: market
economies, not command-and-control economies
with the heavy hand of government, are the best
way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty.
Policies that further strengthen market incentives
and market institutions are relevant for all
economies— industrialized countries, emerging
markets, and the developing world.

 

National Security Strategy 17

 

A return to strong economic growth in Europe
and Japan is vital to U.S. national security inter-
ests. We want our allies to have strong economies
for their own sake, for the sake of the global
economy, and for the sake of global security.
European efforts to remove structural barriers in
their economies are particularly important in this
regard, as are Japan’s efforts to end deflation and
address the problems of non-performing loans in
the Japanese banking system. We will continue to
use our regular consultations with Japan and our
European partners—including through the Group
of Seven (G-7)—to discuss policies they are
adopting to promote growth in their economies
and support higher global economic growth.

Improving stability in emerging markets is also
key to global economic growth. International
flows of investment capital are needed to expand
the productive potential of these economies. These
flows allow emerging markets and developing
countries to make the investments that raise living
standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term
objective should be a world in which all countries
have investment-grade credit ratings that allow
them access to international capital markets and
to invest in their future.

We are committed to policies that will help
emerging markets achieve access to larger capital
flows at lower cost. To this end, we will continue
to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty
in financial markets. We will work actively with
other countries, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), and the private sector to implement the
G-7 Action Plan negotiated earlier this year for
preventing financial crises and more effectively
resolving them when they occur.

The best way to deal with financial crises is to
prevent them from occurring, and we have
encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing
so. We will continue to work with the IMF to
streamline the policy conditions for its lending
and to focus its lending strategy on achieving
economic growth through sound fiscal and

monetary policy, exchange rate policy, and
financial sector policy.

The concept of “free trade” arose as a moral
principle even before it became a pillar of
economics. If you can make something that others
value, you should be able to sell it to them. If
others make something that you value, you should
be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the freedom
for a person—or a nation—to make a living. To
promote free trade, the Unites States has devel-
oped a comprehensive strategy:

* Seize the global initiative. The new global
trade negotiations we helped launch at Doha
in November 2001 will have an ambitious
agenda, especially in agriculture, manufac-
turing, and services, targeted for completion
in 2005. The United States has led the way in
completing the accession of China and a
democratic Taiwan to the World Trade
Organization. We will assist Russia’s
preparations to join the WTO.

* Press regional initiatives. The United States
and other democracies in the Western
Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free
Trade Area of the Americas, targeted for
completion in 2005. This year the United
States will advocate market-access negotia-
tions with its partners, targeted on
agriculture, industrial goods, services, invest-
ment, and government procurement. We will
also offer more opportunity to the poorest
continent, Africa, starting with full use of
the preferences allowed in the African
Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading
to free trade.

* Move ahead with bilateral free trade
agreements. Building on the free trade
agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001,
the Administration will work this year to
complete free trade agreements with Chile
and Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free
trade agreements with a mix of developed

 

18 National Security Strategy

 

and developing countries in all regions of
the world. Initially, Central America,
Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will
be our principal focal points.

Renew the executive-congressional partner-
ship. Every administration’s trade strategy
depends on a productive partnership with
Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the
Administration reestablished majority
support in the Congress for trade liberaliza-
tion by passing Trade Promotion Authority
and the other market opening measures for
developing countries in the Trade Act of
2002. This Administration will work with
Congress to enact new bilateral, regional,
and global trade agreements that will be
concluded under the recently passed Trade
Promotion Authority.

Promote the connection between trade and
development. Trade policies can help devel-
oping countries strengthen property rights,
competition, the rule of law, investment, the
spread of knowledge, open societies, the effi-
cient allocation of resources, and regional
integration—all leading to growth, opportu-
nity, and confidence in developing countries.
The United States is implementing The
Africa Growth and Opportunity Act to
provide market-access for nearly all goods
produced in the 35 countries of sub-
Saharan Africa. We will make more use of
this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean
Basin and continue to work with multilat-
eral and regional institutions to help poorer
countries take advantage of these opportuni-
ties. Beyond market access, the most
important area where trade intersects with
poverty is in public health. We will ensure
that the WTO intellectual property rules are
flexible enough to allow developing nations
to gain access to critical medicines for
extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis, and malaria.

Enforce trade agreements and laws against
unfair practices. Commerce depends on the
rule of law; international trade depends on
enforceable agreements. Our top priorities
are to resolve ongoing disputes with the
European Union, Canada, and Mexico and
to make a global effort to address new tech-
nology, science, and health regulations that
needlessly impede farm exports and
improved agriculture. Laws against unfair
trade practices are often abused, but the
international community must be able to
address genuine concerns about government
subsidies and dumping. International
industrial espionage which undermines fair
competition must be detected and deterred.

Help domestic industries and workers adjust.
There is a sound statutory framework for
these transitional safeguards which we have
used in the agricultural sector and which we
are using this year to help the American steel
industry. The benefits of free trade depend
upon the enforcement of fair trading prac-
tices. These safeguards help ensure that the
benefits of free trade do not come at the
expense of American workers. Trade adjust-
ment assistance will help workers adapt to
the change and dynamism of open markets.

Protect the environment and workers. The
United States must foster economic growth
in ways that will provide a better life along
with widening prosperity. We will incorpo-
rate labor and environmental concerns into
US. trade negotiations, creating a healthy
“network” between multilateral environ-
mental agreements with the WTO, and use
the International Labor Organization, trade
preference programs, and trade talks to
improve working conditions in conjunction
with freer trade.

Enhance energy security. We will strengthen
our own energy security and the shared
prosperity of the global economy by
working with our allies, trading partners,

and energy producers to expand the sources + obtain agreements with key industries to cut
emissions of some of the most potent

vil. EXPAND THE CIRCLE OF DEVELOPMENT BY

OPENING SOCIETIES AND BUILDING

THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF DEMOCRACY

“In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to rebuild it.

As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror,

we must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.”

PRESIDENT BusH

WASHINGTON, D.C. (INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK)

MARCH 14, 2002

A world where some live in comfort and
plenty, while half of the human race lives on less
than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including
all of the world’s poor in an expanding circle of
development—and opportunity—is a moral
imperative and one of the top priorities of U.S.
international policy.

Decades of massive development assistance
have failed to spur economic growth in the
poorest countries. Worse, development aid has
often served to prop up failed policies, relieving
the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery.
Results of aid are typically measured in dollars
spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and
poverty reduction achieved by recipients. These
are the indicators of a failed strategy.

Working with other nations, the United States
is confronting this failure. We forged a new
consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing
for Development in Monterrey that the objectives
of assistance—and the strategies to achieve those
objectives—must change.

This Administration’s goal is to help unleash
the productive potential of individuals in all
nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction
is impossible without the right national policies.
Where governments have implemented real policy
changes, we will provide significant new levels of
assistance. The United States and other developed
countries should set an ambitious and specific
target: to double the size of the world’s poorest
economies within a decade.

The United States Government will pursue
these major strategies to achieve this goal:

Provide resources to aid countries that have
met the challenge of national reform. We
propose a 50 percent increase in the core
development assistance given by the United
States. While continuing our present
programs, including humanitarian assistance
based on need alone, these billions of new
dollars will form a new Millennium
Challenge Account for projects in countries
whose governments rule justly, invest in

 

National Security Strategy 21

 

their people, and encourage economic
freedom. Governments must fight corrup-
tion, respect basic human rights, embrace
the rule of law, invest in health care and
education, follow responsible economic
policies, and enable entrepreneurship. The
Millennium Challenge Account will reward
countries that have demonstrated real policy
change and challenge those that have not to
implement reforms.

Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank
and other development banks in raising living
standards. The United States is committed to
a comprehensive reform agenda for making
the World Bank and the other multilateral
development banks more effective in
improving the lives of the world’s poor. We
have reversed the downward trend in U.S.
contributions and proposed an 18 percent
increase in the U.S. contributions to the
International Development Association
(IDA)—the World Bank’s fund for the
poorest countries—and the African
Development Fund. The key to raising living
standards and reducing poverty around the
world is increasing productivity growth,
especially in the poorest countries. We will
continue to press the multilateral develop-
ment banks to focus on activities that
increase economic productivity, such as
improvements in education, health, rule of
law, and private sector development. Every
project, every loan, every grant must be
judged by how much it will increase
productivity growth in developing countries.

Insist upon measurable results to ensure that
development assistance is actually making a
difference in the lives of the world’s poor.
When it comes to economic development,
what really matters is that more children are
getting a better education, more people have
access to health care and clean water, or
more workers can find jobs to make a better
future for their families. We have a moral

obligation to measure the success of our
development assistance by whether it is
delivering results. For this reason, we will
continue to demand that our own develop-
ment assistance as well as assistance from the
multilateral development banks has measur-
able goals and concrete benchmarks for
achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S.
leadership, the recent IDA replenishment
agreement will establish a monitoring and
evaluation system that measures recipient
countries’ progress. For the first time,
donors can link a portion of their contribu-
tions to IDA to the achievement of actual
development results, and part of the U.S.
contribution is linked in this way. We will
strive to make sure that the World Bank and
other multilateral development banks build
on this progress so that a focus on results is
an integral part of everything that these
institutions do.

Increase the amount of development assistance
that is provided in the form of grants instead
of loans. Greater use of results-based grants
is the best way to help poor countries make
productive investments, particularly in the
social sectors, without saddling them with
ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of

US. leadership, the recent IDA agreement
provided for significant increases in grant
funding for the poorest countries for educa-
tion, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water,
sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal
is to build on that progress by increasing the
use of grants at the other multilateral
development banks. We will also challenge
universities, nonprofits, and the private
sector to match government efforts by using
grants to support development projects that
show results.

Open societies to commerce and investment.
Trade and investment are the real engines of
economic growth. Even if government aid
increases, most money for development

 

22 National Security Strategy

 

must come from trade, domestic capital, and
foreign investment. An effective strategy
must try to expand these flows as well. Free
markets and free trade are key priorities of
our national security strategy.

Secure public health. The scale of the public
health crisis in poor countries is enormous.
In countries afflicted by epidemics and
pandemics like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and
tuberculosis, growth and development will
be threatened until these scourges can be
contained. Resources from the developed
world are necessary but will be effective only
with honest governance, which supports
prevention programs and provides effective
local infrastructure. The United States has
strongly backed the new global fund for
HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan and its focus on
combining prevention with a broad strategy
for treatment and care. The United States
already contributes more than twice as much
money to such efforts as the next largest
donor. If the global fund demonstrates its
promise, we will be ready to give even more.

Emphasize education. Literacy and learning
are the foundation of democracy and devel-
opment. Only about 7 percent of World
Bank resources are devoted to education.
This proportion should grow. The United
States will increase its own funding for
education assistance by at least 20 percent
with an emphasis on improving basic educa-
tion and teacher training in Africa. The
United States can also bring information
technology to these societies, many of whose
education systems have been devastated by
HIV/AIDS.

Continue to aid agricultural development.
New technologies, including biotechnology,
have enormous potential to improve crop
yields in developing countries while using
fewer pesticides and less water. Using sound
science, the United States should help bring
these benefits to the 800 million people,
including 300 million children, who still
suffer from hunger and malnutrition.

vill. DEVELOP AGENDAS FOR COOPERATIVE ACTION

WITH THE OTHER MAIN CENTERS OF GLOBAL POWER

“We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th century

to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war.”

PRESIDENT BusH

WEsT Point, NEw YORK
JUNE 1, 2002

America will implement its strategies by
organizing coalitions—as broad as practicable—
of states able and willing to promote a balance of
power that favors freedom. Effective coalition
leadership requires clear priorities, an appreciation
of others’ interests, and consistent consultations
among partners with a spirit of humility.

There is little of lasting consequence that the
United States can accomplish in the world without
the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends
in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of
two of the strongest and most able international
institutions in the world: the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), which has, since its incep-
tion, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and
inter-European security, and the European Union
(EU), our partner in opening world trade.

The attacks of September 11 were also an
attack on NATO, as NATO itself recognized when
it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the
first time. NATO’s core mission—collective
defense of the transatlantic alliance of democra-
cies—remains, but NATO must develop new
structures and capabilities to carry out that
mission under new circumstances. NATO must

build a capability to field, at short notice, highly
mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are
needed to respond to a threat against any member
of the alliance.

The alliance must be able to act wherever our
interests are threatened, creating coalitions under
NATO’s own mandate, as well as contributing to
mission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:

expand NATO’s membership to those
democratic nations willing and able to share
the burden of defending and advancing our
common interests;

* ensure that the military forces of NATO
nations have appropriate combat
contributions to make in coalition warfare;

+ develop planning processes to enable
those contributions to become effective
multinational fighting forces;

* take advantage of the technological opportu-
nities and economies of scale in our defense
spending to transform NATO military forces
so that they dominate potential aggressors
and diminish our vulnerabilities;

 

National Security Strategy 25

 

* streamline and increase the flexibility
of command structures to meet new
operational demands and the associated
requirements of training, integrating,
and experimenting with new force
configurations; and

* maintain the ability to work and fight
together as allies even as we take the
necessary steps to transform and modernize
our forces.

If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes,
the rewards will be a partnership as central to the
security and interests of its member states as was
the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a
common perspective on the threats to our soci-
eties and improve our ability to take common
action in defense of our nations and their inter-
ests. At the same time, we welcome our European
allies’ efforts to forge a greater foreign policy and
defense identity with the EU, and commit
ourselves to close consultations to ensure that
these developments work with NATO. We cannot
afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare
the family of transatlantic democracies for the
challenges to come.

The attacks of September 11 energized
America’s Asian alliances. Australia invoked the
ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an
attack on Australia itself, following that historic
decision with the dispatch of some of the world’s
finest combat forces for Operation Enduring
Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea
provided unprecedented levels of military
logistical support within weeks of the terrorist
attack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-
terrorism with our alliance partners in Thailand
and the Philippines and received invaluable
assistance from close friends like Singapore and
New Zealand.

The war against terrorism has proven that
America’s alliances in Asia not only underpin
regional peace and stability, but are flexible and
ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our
Asian alliances and friendships, we will:

* look to Japan to continue forging a leading
role in regional and global affairs based on
our common interests, our common values,
and our close defense and diplomatic
cooperation;

* work with South Korea to maintain vigilance
towards the North while preparing our
alliance to make contributions to the
broader stability of the region over the
longer term;

* build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance
cooperation as we continue working
together to resolve regional and global
problems—as we have so many times from
the Battle of the Coral Sea to Tora Bora;

* maintain forces in the region that reflect
our commitments to our allies, our require-
ments, our technological advances, and the
strategic environment; and

* build on stability provided by these alliances,
as well as with institutions such as ASEAN
and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum, to develop a mix of regional and
bilateral strategies to manage change in this
dynamic region.

We are attentive to the possible renewal of old
patterns of great power competition. Several
potential great powers are now in the midst of
internal transition—most importantly Russia,
India, and China. In all three cases, recent devel-
opments have encouraged our hope that a truly
global consensus about basic principles is slowly
taking shape.

With Russia, we are already building a new
strategic relationship based on a central reality of
the twenty-first century: the United States and
Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The
Moscow Treaty on Strategic Reductions is
emblematic of this new reality and reflects a crit-
ical change in Russian thinking that promises to
lead to productive, long-term relations with the
Euro-Atlantic community and the United States.
Russia’s top leaders have a realistic assessment of

 

26 National Security Strategy

 

their country’s current weakness and the
policies—internal and external—needed to reverse
those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly,
that Cold War approaches do not serve their
national interests and that Russian and American
strategic interests overlap in many areas.

United States policy seeks to use this turn in
Russian thinking to refocus our relationship on
emerging and potential common interests and
challenges. We are broadening our already exten-
sive cooperation in the global war on terrorism.
We are facilitating Russia’s entry into the World
Trade Organization, without lowering standards
for accession, to promote beneficial bilateral trade
and investment relations. We have created the
NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening
security cooperation among Russia, our European
allies, and ourselves. We will continue to bolster
the independence and stability of the states of the
former Soviet Union in the belief that a pros-
perous and stable neighborhood will reinforce
Russia’s growing commitment to integration into
the Euro-Atlantic community.

At the same time, we are realistic about the
differences that still divide us from Russia and
about the time and effort it will take to build an
enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust
of our motives and policies by key Russian elites
slows improvement in our relations. Russia’s
uneven commitment to the basic values of
free-market democracy and dubious record in
combating the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction remain matters of great concern.
Russia’s very weakness limits the opportunities
for cooperation. Nevertheless, those opportunities
are vastly greater now than in recent years—or
even decades.

The United States has undertaken a transfor-
mation in its bilateral relationship with India
based on a conviction that U.S. interests require a
strong relationship with India. We are the two
largest democracies, committed to political
freedom protected by representative government.
India is moving toward greater economic freedom

as well. We have a common interest in the free
flow of commerce, including through the vital sea
lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an
interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a
strategically stable Asia.

Differences remain, including over the develop-
ment of India’s nuclear and missile programs, and
the pace of India’s economic reforms. But while in
the past these concerns may have dominated our
thinking about India, today we start with a view
of India as a growing world power with which we
have common strategic interests. Through a
strong partnership with India, we can best address
any differences and shape a dynamic future.

The United States relationship with China is
an important part of our strategy to promote a
stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific
region. We welcome the emergence of a strong,
peaceful, and prosperous China. The democratic
development of China is crucial to that future. Yet,
a quarter century after beginning the process of
shedding the worst features of the Communist
legacy, China’s leaders have not yet made the next
series of fundamental choices about the character
of their state. In pursuing advanced military
capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the
Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated
path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit
of national greatness. In time, China will find that
social and political freedom is the only source of
that greatness.

The United States seeks a constructive relation-
ship with a changing China. We already cooperate
well where our interests overlap, including the
current war on terrorism and in promoting
stability on the Korean peninsula. Likewise, we
have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan
and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on
counterterrorism and similar transitional
concerns. Shared health and environmental
threats, such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge
us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens.

Addressing these transnational threats will
challenge China to become more open with

 

National Security Strategy 27

 

information, promote the development of civil
society, and enhance individual human rights.
China has begun to take the road to political
openness, permitting many personal freedoms and
conducting village-level elections, yet remains
strongly committed to national one-party rule by
the Communist Party. To make that nation truly
accountable to its citizen’s needs and aspirations,
however, much work remains to be done. Only by
allowing the Chinese people to think, assemble,
and worship freely can China reach its full potential.

Our important trade relationship will benefit
from China’s entry into the World Trade
Organization, which will create more export
opportunities and ultimately more jobs for
American farmers, workers, and companies. China
is our fourth largest trading partner, with over
$100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power
of market principles and the WTO’s requirements
for transparency and accountability will advance
openness and the rule of law in China to help
establish basic protections for commerce and for
citizens. There are, however, other areas in which

we have profound disagreements. Our commitment
to the self-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan
Relations Act is one. Human rights is another. We
expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation
commitments. We will work to narrow differences
where they exist, but not allow them to preclude
cooperation where we agree.

The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally
changed the context for relations between the
United States and other main centers of global
power, and opened vast, new opportunities. With
our long-standing allies in Europe and Asia, and
with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we must
develop active agendas of cooperation lest these
relationships become routine and unproductive.

Every agency of the United States Government
shares the challenge. We can build fruitful habits
of consultation, quiet argument, sober analysis,
and common action. In the long-term, these are
the practices that will sustain the supremacy of
our common principles and keep open the path
of progress.

1X. TRANSFORM AMERICA’S NATIONAL SECURITY

INSTITUTIONS TO MEET THE CHALLENGES AND

OPPORTUNITIES OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY

“Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity.

They did not touch its source. America is successful because of the

hard work, creativity, and enterprise of our people.”

PRESIDENT BusH
WASHINGTON, D.C. (JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS)
SEPTEMBER 20, 2001

The major institutions of American national
security were designed in a different era to meet
different requirements. All of them must be
transformed.

It is time to reaffirm the essential role of
American military strength. We must build and
maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our
military's highest priority is to defend the United
States. To do so effectively, our military must:

* assure our allies and friends;
+ dissuade future military competition;

+ deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and
friends; and

* decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence
fails.

The unparalleled strength of the United States
armed forces, and their forward presence, have
maintained the peace in some of the world’s most
strategically vital regions. However, the threats and
enemies we must confront have changed, and so
must our forces. A military structured to deter
massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed

to focus more on how an adversary might fight
rather than where and when a war might occur.
We will channel our energies to overcome a host
of operational challenges.

The presence of American forces overseas is
one of the most profound symbols of the U.S.
commitments to allies and friends. Through our
willingness to use force in our own defense and in
defense of others, the United States demonstrates
its resolve to maintain a balance of power that
favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and
‘o meet the many security challenges we face, the
United States will require bases and stations
within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast
Asia, as well as temporary access arrangements for
he long-distance deployment of U.S. forces.

Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was
ow on the list of major planning contingencies.
Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate across
he length and breadth of that remote nation,
using every branch of the armed forces. We must
prepare for more such deployments by developing
assets such as advanced remote sensing,
ong-range precision strike capabilities, and

 

 

National Security Strategy 29

 

transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces.
This broad portfolio of military capabilities must
also include the ability to defend the homeland,
conduct information operations, ensure U.S.
access to distant theaters, and protect critical
US. infrastructure and assets in outer space.

Innovation within the armed forces will rest on
experimentation with new approaches to warfare,
strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S.
intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage
of science and technology. We must also trans-
form the way the Department of Defense is run,
especially in financial management and recruit-
ment and retention. Finally, while maintaining
near-term readiness and the ability to fight the
war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the
President with a wider range of military options
to discourage aggression or any form of coercion
against the United States, our allies, and our friends.

We know from history that deterrence can fail;
and we know from experience that some enemies
cannot be deterred. The United States must and
will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt
by an enemy—whether a state or non-state
actor—to impose its will on the United States, our
allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces
sufficient to support our obligations, and to
defend freedom. Our forces will be strong enough
to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a
military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or
equaling, the power of the United States.

Intelligence—and how we use it—is our first
line of defense against terrorists and the threat
posed by hostile states. Designed around the
priority of gathering enormous information about
a massive, fixed object—the Soviet bloc—the
intelligence community is coping with the
challenge of following a far more complex and
elusive set of targets.

We must transform our intelligence capabilities
and build new ones to keep pace with the nature
of these threats. Intelligence must be appropriately
integrated with our defense and law enforcement

systems and coordinated with our allies and
friends. We need to protect the capabilities we
have so that we do not arm our enemies with the
knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who
would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to
limit our prevention and response options and to

maximize injury.

We must strengthen intelligence warning and
analysis to provide integrated threat assessments
for national and homeland security. Since the
threats inspired by foreign governments and
groups may be conducted inside the United States,
we must also ensure the proper fusion of informa-
tion between intelligence and law enforcement.

Initiatives in this area will include:

* strengthening the authority of the Director
of Central Intelligence to lead the develop-
ment and actions of the Nation’s foreign
intelligence capabilities;

* establishing a new framework for intelli-
gence warning that provides seamless and
integrated warning across the spectrum of
threats facing the nation and our allies;

* continuing to develop new methods of
collecting information to sustain our
intelligence advantage;

* investing in future capabilities while working
to protect them through a more vigorous
effort to prevent the compromise of intelli-
gence capabilities; and

* collecting intelligence against the terrorist
danger across the government with all-
source analysis.

As the United States Government relies on the
armed forces to defend America’s interests, it must
rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations.
We will ensure that the Department of State
receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of
American diplomacy. The State Department takes
the lead in managing our bilateral relationships
with other governments. And in this new era, its

 

30 National Security Strategy

 

people and institutions must be able to interact
equally adroitly with non-governmental organiza-
tions and international institutions. Officials
trained mainly in international politics must

also extend their reach to understand complex
issues of domestic governance around the

world, including public health, education, law
enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.

Our diplomats serve at the front line of
complex negotiations, civil wars, and other
humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian
relief requirements are better understood, we
must also be able to help build police forces,
court systems, and legal codes, local and provin-
cial government institutions, and electoral
systems. Effective international cooperation is
needed to accomplish these goals, backed by
American readiness to play our part.

Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt
so that we can reach out to others, we also need a
different and more comprehensive approach to
public information efforts that can help people
around the world learn about and understand
America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of
civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash
inside a civilization, a battle for the future of the
Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas and this
is an area where America must excel.

We will take the actions necessary to ensure
that our efforts to meet our global security
commitments and protect Americans are not
impaired by the potential for investigations,
inquiry, or prosecution by the International
Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does
not extend to Americans and which we do not
accept. We will work together with other nations
to avoid complications in our military operations
and cooperation, through such mechanisms as
multilateral and bilateral agreements that will
protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will
implement fully the American Servicemembers
Protection Act, whose provisions are intended to
ensure and enhance the protection of U.S.
personnel and officials.

We will make hard choices in the coming year
and beyond to ensure the right level and alloca-
tion of government spending on national security.
The United States Government must strengthen
its defenses to win this war. At home, our most
important priority is to protect the homeland for
the American people.

Today, the distinction between domestic and
foreign affairs is diminishing. In a globalized
world, events beyond America’s borders have a
greater impact inside them. Our society must be
open to people, ideas, and goods from across the
globe. The characteristics we most cherish—our
freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and
modern life—are vulnerable to terrorism. This
vulnerability will persist long after we bring to
justice those responsible for the September 11
attacks. As time passes, individuals may gain
access to means of destruction that until now
could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and
squadrons. This is a new condition of life. We
will adjust to it and thrive—in spite of it.

In exercising our leadership, we will respect the
values, judgment, and interests of our friends and
partners. Still, we will be prepared to act apart
when our interests and unique responsibilities
require. When we disagree on particulars, we will
explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns
and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not
allow such disagreements to obscure our determi-
nation to secure together, with our allies and
our friends, our shared fundamental interests
and values.

Ultimately, the foundation of American
strength is at home. It is in the skills of our
people, the dynamism of our economy, and the
resilience of our institutions. A diverse, modern
society has inherent, ambitious, entrepreneurial
energy. Our strength comes from what we do
with that energy. That is where our national
security begins.

THE WHITE HOUSE

WASHINGTON

My fellow Americans,

America is at war. This is a wartime national security strategy required by the grave challenge
we face — the rise of terrorism fueled by an aggressive ideology of hatred and murder, fully
revealed to the American people on September 11, 2001. This strategy reflects our most solemn
obligation: to protect the security of the American people.

America also has an unprecedented opportunity to lay the foundations for future peace. The
ideals that have inspired our history — freedom, democracy, and human dignity — are increasingly
inspiring individuals and nations throughout the world. And because free nations tend toward
peace, the advance of liberty will make America more secure.

These inseparable priorities — fighting and winning the war on terror and promoting freedom as
the alternative to tyranny and despair — have now guided American policy for more than 4 years.

We have kept on the offensive against terrorist networks, leaving our enemy weakened, but not
yet defeated.

We have joined with the Afghan people to bring down the Taliban regime ~ the protectors of the
al-Qaida network — and aided a new, democratic government to rise in its place.

We have focused the attention of the world on the proliferation of dangerous weapons -- although
great challenges in this area remain.

We have stood for the spread of democracy in the broader Middle East — meeting challenges yet
seeing progress few would have predicted or expected.

We have cultivated stable and cooperative relations with all the major powers of the world.

We have dramatically expanded our efforts to encourage economic development and the hope it
brings — and focused these efforts on the promotion of reform and achievement of results.

We led an international coalition to topple the dictator of Iraq, who had brutalized his own
people, terrorized his region, defied the international community, and sought and used weapons
of mass destruction.

And we are fighting alongside Iraqis to secure a united, stable, and democratic Iraq — a new ally
in the war on terror in the heart of the Middie East.

We have seen great accomplishments, confronted new challenges, and refined our approach as
conditions changed. We have also found that the defense of freedom brings us loss and sorrow,
because freedom has determined enemies. We have always known that the war on terror would
require great sacrifice — and in this war, we have said farewell to some very good men and
women. The terrorists have used dramatic acts of murder — from the streets of Fallujah to the

subways of London — in an attempt to undermine our will. The struggle against this enemy — an
enemy that targets the innocent without conscience or hesitation — has been difficult. And our
work is far from over.

America now faces a choice between the path of fear and the path of confidence. The path of
fear — isolationism and protectionism, retreat and retrenchment — appeals to those who find our
challenges too great and fail to see our opportunities. Yet history teaches that every time
American leaders have taken this path, the challenges have only increased and the missed
opportunities have left future generations less secure.

This Administration has chosen the path of confidence. We choose leadership over isolationism,
and the pursuit of free and fair trade and open markets over protectionism. We choose to deal
with challenges now rather than leaving them for future generations. We fight our enemies
abroad instead of waiting for them to arrive in our country. We seek to shape the world, not
merely be shaped by it; to influence events for the better instead of being at their mercy.

The path we have chosen is consistent with the great tradition of American foreign policy. Like
the policies of Harry Truman and Ronald Reagan, our approach is idealistic about our national
goals, and realistic about the means to achieve them.

To follow this path, we must maintain and expand our national strength so we can deal with
threats and challenges before they can damage our people or our interests. We must maintain a
military without peer — yet our strength is not founded on force of arms alone. It also rests on
economic prosperity and a vibrant democracy. And it rests on strong alliances, friendships, and
international institutions, which enable us to promote freedom, prosperity, and peace in common
purpose with others.

Our national security strategy is founded upon two pillars:

The first pillar is promoting freedom, justice, and human dignity — working to end tyranny, to
promote effective democracies, and to extend prosperity through free and fair trade and wise
development policies. Free governments are accountable to their people, govern their territory
effectively, and pursue economic and political policies that benefit their citizens. Free
governments do not oppress their people or attack other free nations. Peace and international
stability are most reliably built on a foundation of freedom.

The second pillar of our strategy is confronting the challenges of our time by leading a growing
community of democracies. Many of the problems we face ~ from the threat of pandemic
disease, to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to terrorism, to human trafficking, to
natural disasters — reach across borders. Effective multinational efforts are essential to solve
these problems. Yet history has shown that only when we do our part will others do theirs.
America must continue to lead.

Overview of America’s National Security Strategy

It is the policy of the United States to seek and support democratic movements and
institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our
world. In the world today, the fundamental character of regimes matters as much as the
distribution of power among them. The goal of our statecraft is to help create a world of
democratic, well-governed states that can meet the needs of their citizens and conduct
themselves responsibly in the international system. This is the best way to provide
enduring security for the American people.

Achieving this goal is the work of generations. The United States is in the early years of
a long struggle, similar to what our country faced in the early years of the Cold War. The
20"" century witnessed the triumph of freedom over the threats of fascism and
communism. Yet a new totalitarian ideology now threatens, an ideology grounded not in
secular philosophy but in the perversion of a proud religion. Its content may be different
from the ideologies of the last century, but its means are similar: intolerance, murder,
terror, enslavement, and repression.

Like those who came before us, we must lay the foundations and build the institutions
that our country needs to meet the challenges we face. The chapters that follow will
focus on several essential tasks. The United States must:

e Champion aspirations for human dignity;

e Strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us
and our friends;

e Work with others to defuse regional conflicts;

e Prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our friends with weapons of
mass destruction (WMD);

e Ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade;

e Expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure
of democracy;

e Develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power;

e Transform America’s national security institutions to meet the challenges and
opportunities of the 21* century; and

e Engage the opportunities and confront the challenges of globalization.

Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity

A. Summary of National Security Strategy 2002

The United States must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and
true for all people everywhere. These nonnegotiable demands of human dignity are
protected most securely in democracies. The United States Government will work to
advance human dignity in word and deed, speaking out for freedom and against
violations of human rights and allocating appropriate resources to advance these ideals.

B. Successes and Challenges since 2002

Since 2002, the world has seen extraordinary progress in the expansion of freedom,
democracy, and human dignity:

e The peoples of Afghanistan and Iraq have replaced tyrannies with democracies.

e In Afghanistan, the tyranny of the Taliban has been replaced by a freely-elected
government; Afghans have written and ratified a constitution guaranteeing rights
and freedoms unprecedented in their history; and an elected legislature gives the
people a regular voice in their government.

e In Iraq, a tyrant has been toppled; over 8 million Iraqis voted in the nation’s first
free and fair election; a freely negotiated constitution was passed by a referendum
in which almost 10 million Iraqis participated; and, for the first time in their
history, nearly 12 million Iraqis have elected a permanent government under a
popularly determined constitution.

e The people of Lebanon have rejected the heavy hand of foreign rule. The people of
Egypt have experienced more open but still flawed elections. Saudi Arabia has taken
some preliminary steps to give its citizens more of a voice in their government.
Jordan has made progress in opening its political process. Kuwait and Morocco are
pursuing agendas of political reform.

e The “color revolutions” in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan have brought new hope
for freedom across the Eurasian landmass.

e Democracy has made further advances in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, with
peaceful transfers of power; growth in independent judiciaries and the rule of law;
improved election practices; and expanding political and economic rights.

The human desire for freedom is universal, but the growth of freedom is not inevitable.
Without support from free nations, freedom’s spread could be hampered by the
challenges we face:

 

2

National Security Strategy

e Many governments are at fragile stages of political development and need to
consolidate democratic institutions — and leaders that have won democratic elections
need to uphold the principles of democracy;

e Some governments have regressed, eroding the democratic freedoms their peoples
enjoy;

e Some governments have not delivered the benefits of effective democracy and
prosperity to their citizens, leaving them susceptible to or taken over by demagogues
peddling an anti-free market authoritarianism;

e Some regimes seek to separate economic liberty from political liberty, pursuing
prosperity while denying their people basic rights and freedoms; and

e Tyranny persists in its harshest form in a number of nations.
C. The Way Ahead

The United States has long championed freedom because doing so reflects our values and
advances our interests. It reflects our values because we believe the desire for freedom
lives in every human heart and the imperative of human dignity transcends all nations and
cultures.

Championing freedom advances our interests because the survival of liberty at home
increasingly depends on the success of liberty abroad. Governments that honor their
citizens’ dignity and desire for freedom tend to uphold responsible conduct toward other
nations, while governments that brutalize their people also threaten the peace and
stability of other nations. Because democracies are the most responsible members of the
international system, promoting democracy is the most effective long-term measure for
strengthening international stability; reducing regional conflicts; countering terrorism and
terror-supporting extremism; and extending peace and prosperity.

To protect our Nation and honor our values, the United States seeks to extend freedom
across the globe by leading an international effort to end tyranny and to promote effective
democracy.

1. Explaining the Goal: Ending Tyranny

Tyranny is the combination of brutality, poverty, instability, corruption, and suffering,
forged under the rule of despots and despotic systems. People living in nations such as
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), Iran, Syria, Cuba, Belarus, Burma,
and Zimbabwe know firsthand the meaning of tyranny; it is the bleak reality they endure
every day. And the nations they border know the consequences of tyranny as well, for
the misrule of tyrants at home leads to instability abroad. All tyrannies threaten the
world’s interest in freedom’s expansion, and some tyrannies, in their pursuit of WMD or
sponsorship of terrorism, threaten our immediate security interests as well.

 

National Security Strategy 3

Tyranny is not inevitable, and recent history reveals the arc of the tyrant’s fate. The 20""
century has been called the “Democracy Century,” as tyrannies fell one by one and
democracies rose in their stead. At mid-century about two dozen of the world’s
governments were democratic; 50 years later this number was over 120. The democratic
revolution has embraced all cultures and all continents.

Though tyranny has few advocates, it needs more adversaries. In today’s world, no
tyrant’s rule can survive without the support or at least the tolerance of other nations. To
end tyranny we must summon the collective outrage of the free world against the
oppression, abuse, and impoverishment that tyrannical regimes inflict on their people —
and summon their collective action against the dangers tyrants pose to the security of the
world.

An end to tyranny will not mark an end to all global ills. Disputes, disease, disorder,
poverty, and injustice will outlast tyranny, confronting democracies long after the last
tyrant has fallen. Yet tyranny must not be tolerated — it is a crime of man, not a fact of
nature.

2. Explaining the Goal: Promoting Effective Democracies

As tyrannies give way, we must help newly free nations build effective democracies:
states that are respectful of human dignity, accountable to their citizens, and responsible
towards their neighbors. Effective democracies:

e Honor and uphold basic human rights, including freedom of religion, conscience,
speech, assembly, association, and press;

e Are responsive to their citizens, submitting to the will of the people, especially when
people vote to change their government;

e Exercise effective sovereignty and maintain order within their own borders, protect
independent and impartial systems of justice, punish crime, embrace the rule of law,
and resist corruption; and

e Limit the reach of government, protecting the institutions of civil society, including
the family, religious communities, voluntary associations, private property,
independent business, and a market economy.

In effective democracies, freedom is indivisible. Political, religious, and economic
liberty advance together and reinforce each other. Some regimes have opened their
economies while trying to restrict political or religious freedoms. This will not work.
Over time, as people gain control over their economic lives, they will insist on more
control over their political and personal lives as well. Yet political progress can be
jeopardized if economic progress does not keep pace. We will harness the tools of
economic assistance, development aid, trade, and good governance to help ensure that
new democracies are not burdened with economic stagnation or endemic corruption.

 

4

National Security Strategy

Elections are the most visible sign of a free society and can play a critical role in
advancing effective democracy. But elections alone are not enough — they must be
reinforced by other values, rights, and institutions to bring about lasting freedom. Our
goal is human liberty protected by democratic institutions.

Participation in elections by individuals or parties must include their commitment to the
equality of all citizens; minority rights; civil liberties; voluntary and peaceful transfer of
power; and the peaceful resolution of differences. Effective democracy also requires
institutions that can protect individual liberty and ensure that the government is
responsive and accountable to its citizens. There must be an independent media to
inform the public and facilitate the free exchange of ideas. There must be political
associations and political parties that can freely compete. Rule of law must be reinforced
by an independent judiciary, a professional legal establishment, and an honest and
competent police force.

These principles are tested by the victory of Hamas candidates in the recent elections in
the Palestinian territories. The Palestinian people voted in a process that was free, fair,
and inclusive.

The Palestinian people having made their choice at the polls, the burden now shifts to
those whom they have elected to take the steps necessary to advance peace, prosperity,
and statehood for the Palestinian people. Hamas has been designated as a terrorist
organization by the United States and European Union (EV) because it has embraced
terrorism and deliberately killed innocent civilians. The international community has
made clear that there is a fundamental contradiction between armed group and militia
activities and the building of a democratic state. The international community has also
made clear that a two-state solution to the conflict requires all participants in the
democratic process to renounce violence and terror, accept Israel’s right to exist, and
disarm as outlined in the Roadmap. These requirements are clear, firm, and of long
standing. The opportunity for peace and statehood — a consistent goal of this
Administration — is open if Hamas will abandon its terrorist roots and change its
relationship with Israel.

The elected Hamas representatives also have an opportunity and a responsibility to
uphold the principles of democratic government, including protection of minority rights
and basic freedoms and a commitment to a recurring, free, and fair electoral process. By
respecting these principles, the new Palestinian leaders can demonstrate their own
commitment to freedom and help bring a lasting democracy to the Palestinian territories.
But any elected government that refuses to honor these principles cannot be considered
fully democratic, however it may have taken office.

3. How We Will Advance Freedom: Principled in Goals and Pragmatic in Means
We have a responsibility to promote human freedom. Yet freedom cannot be imposed; it

must be chosen. The form that freedom and democracy take in any land will reflect the
history, culture, and habits unique to its people.

 

National Security Strategy 5

The United States will stand with and support advocates of freedom in every land.
Though our principles are consistent, our tactics will vary. They will reflect, in part,
where each government is on the path from tyranny to democracy. In some cases, we
will take vocal and visible steps on behalf of immediate change. In other cases, we will
lend more quiet support to lay the foundation for future reforms. As we consider which
approaches to take, we will be guided by what will most effectively advance freedom’s
cause while we balance other interests that are also vital to the security and well-being of
the American people.

In the cause of ending tyranny and promoting effective democracy, we will employ the
full array of political, economic, diplomatic, and other tools at our disposal, including:

e Speaking out against abuses of human rights;

e Supporting publicly democratic reformers in repressive nations, including by holding
high-level meetings with them at the White House, Department of State, and U.S.
Embassies;

e Using foreign assistance to support the development of free and fair elections, rule of
law, civil society, human rights, women’s rights, free media, and religious freedom;

e Tailoring assistance and training of military forces to support civilian control of the
military and military respect for human rights in a democratic society;

e Applying sanctions that designed to target those who rule oppressive regimes while
sparing the people;

e Encouraging other nations not to support oppressive regimes;

e Partnering with other democratic nations to promote freedom, democracy, and human
rights in specific countries and regions;

e Strengthening and building new initiatives such as the Broader Middle East and North
Africa Initiative’s Foundation for the Future, the Community of Democracies, and the
United Nations Democracy Fund;

e Forming creative partnerships with nongovernmental organizations and other civil
society voices to support and reinforce their work;

e Working with existing international institutions such as the United Nations and
regional organizations such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, the African Union (AU), and the Organization of American States (OAS) to
help implement their democratic commitments, and helping establish democracy
charters in regions that lack them;

e Supporting condemnation in multilateral institutions of egregious violations of human
rights and freedoms;

e Encouraging foreign direct investment in and foreign assistance to countries where
there is a commitment to the rule of law, fighting corruption, and democratic
accountability; and

e Concluding free trade agreements (FTAs) that encourage countries to enhance the
rule of law, fight corruption, and further democratic accountability.

These tools must be used vigorously to protect the freedoms that face particular peril
around the world: religious freedom, women’s rights, and freedom for men, women, and
children caught in the cruel network of human trafficking.

e Against a terrorist enemy that is defined by religious intolerance, we defend the First
Freedom: the right of people to believe and worship according to the dictates of their
own conscience, free from the coercion of the state, the coercion of the majority, or
the coercion of a minority that wants to dictate what others must believe.

e No nation can be free if half its population is oppressed and denied fundamental
rights. We affirm the inherent dignity and worth of women, and support vigorously
their full participation in all aspects of society.

e Trafficking in persons is a form of modern-day slavery, and we strive for its total
abolition. Future generations will not excuse those who turn a blind eye to it.

Our commitment to the promotion of freedom is a commitment to walk alongside
governments and their people as they make the difficult transition to effective
democracies. We will not abandon them before the transition is secure because immature
democracies can be prone to conflict and vulnerable to exploitation by terrorists. We will
not let the challenges of democratic transitions frighten us into clinging to the illusory
stability of the authoritarian.

America’s closest alliances and friendships are with countries with whom we share
common values and principles. The more countries demonstrate that they treat their own
citizens with respect and are committed to democratic principles, the closer and stronger
their relationship with America is likely to be.

The United States will lead and calls on other nations to join us in a common
international effort. All free nations have a responsibility to stand together for freedom
because all free nations share an interest in freedom’s advance.

Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent Attacks
Against Us and Our Friends

A. Summary of National Security Strategy 2002

Defeating terrorism requires a long-term strategy and a break with old patterns. We are
fighting a new enemy with global reach. The United States can no longer simply rely on
deterrence to keep the terrorists at bay or defensive measures to thwart them at the last
moment. The fight must be taken to the enemy, to keep them on the run. To succeed in
our own efforts, we need the support and concerted action of friends and allies. We must
join with others to deny the terrorists what they need to survive: safe haven, financial
support, and the support and protection that certain nation-states historically have given
them.

B. Current Context: Successes and Challenges

The war against terror is not over. America is safer, but not yet safe. As the enemy
adjusts to our successes, so too must we adjust. The successes are many:

e Al-Qaida has lost its safe haven in Afghanistan.

e A multinational coalition joined by the Iraqis is aggressively prosecuting the war
against the terrorists in Iraq.

e The al-Qaida network has been significantly degraded. Most of those in the al-Qaida
network responsible for the September 11 attacks, including the plot’s mastermind
Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, have been captured or killed.

e There is a broad and growing global consensus that the deliberate killing of innocents
is never justified by any calling or cause.

e Many nations have rallied to fight terrorism, with unprecedented cooperation on law
enforcement, intelligence, military, and diplomatic activity.

e Numerous countries that were part of the problem before September 11 are now
increasingly becoming part of the solution — and this transformation has occurred
without destabilizing friendly regimes in key regions.

e The Administration has worked with Congress to adopt and implement key reforms
like the Patriot Act which promote our security while also protecting our fundamental
liberties.

National Security Strategy

The enemy is determined, however, and we face some old and new challenges:

e Terrorist networks today are more dispersed and less centralized. They are more
reliant on smaller cells inspired by a common ideology and less directed by a central
command structure.

e While the United States Government and its allies have thwarted many attacks, we
have not been able to stop them all. The terrorists have struck in many places,
including Afghanistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan,
Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and the United Kingdom. And they continue to seek
WMD in order to inflict even more catastrophic attacks on us and our friends and
allies.

e The ongoing fight in Iraq has been twisted by terrorist propaganda as a rallying cry.

e Some states, such as Syria and Iran, continue to harbor terrorists at home and sponsor
terrorist activity abroad.

C. The Way Ahead

From the beginning, the War on Terror has been both a battle of arms and a battle of
ideas — a fight against the terrorists and against their murderous ideology. In the short
run, the fight involves using military force and other instruments of national power to kill
or capture the terrorists, deny them safe haven or control of any nation; prevent them
from gaining access to WMD; and cut off their sources of support. In the long run,
winning the war on terror means winning the battle of ideas, for it is ideas that can turn
the disenchanted into murderers willing to kill innocent victims.

While the War on Terror is a battle of ideas, it is not a battle of religions. The
transnational terrorists confronting us today exploit the proud religion of Islam to serve a
violent political vision: the establishment, by terrorism and subversion, of a totalitarian
empire that denies all political and religious freedom. These terrorists distort the idea of
jihad into a call for murder against those they regard as apostates or unbelievers —
including Christians, Jews, Hindus, other religious traditions, and all Muslims who
disagree with them. Indeed, most of the terrorist attacks since September 11 have
occurred in Muslim countries — and most of the victims have been Muslims.

To wage this battle of ideas effectively, we must be clear-eyed about what does and does
not give rise to terrorism:

e Terrorism is not the inevitable by-product of poverty. Many of the September 11
hijackers were from middle-class backgrounds, and many terrorist leaders, like bin
Laden, are from privileged upbringings.

 

National Security Strategy 9

e Terrorism is not simply a result of hostility to U.S. policy in Iraq. The United States
was attacked on September 11 and earlier, well before we toppled the Saddam Hussein
regime. Moreover, countries that stayed out of the Iraq war have not been spared from
terror attack.

e Terrorism is not simply a result of Israeli-Palestinian issues. Al-Qaida plotting for the
September 11 attacks began in the 1990s, during an active period in the peace process.

e Terrorism is not simply a response to our efforts to prevent terror attacks. The al-
Qaida network targeted the United States long before the United States targeted al-
Qaida. Indeed, the terrorists are emboldened more by perceptions of weakness than by
demonstrations of resolve. Terrorists lure recruits by telling them that we are decadent
and easily intimidated and will retreat if attacked.

The terrorism we confront today springs from:

e Political alienation. Transnational terrorists are recruited from people who have no
voice in their own government and see no legitimate way to promote change in their
own country. Without a stake in the existing order, they are vulnerable to
manipulation by those who advocate a perverse vision based on violence and
destruction.

e Grievances that can be blamed on others. The failures the terrorists feel and see are
blamed on others, and on perceived injustices from the recent or sometimes distant
past. The terrorists’ rhetoric keeps wounds associated with this past fresh and raw, a
potent motivation for revenge and terror.

e Sub-cultures of conspiracy and misinformation. Terrorists recruit more effectively
from populations whose information about the world is contaminated by falsehoods
and corrupted by conspiracy theories. The distortions keep alive grievances and filter
out facts that would challenge popular prejudices and self-serving propaganda.

e An ideology that justifies murder. Terrorism ultimately depends upon the appeal of
an ideology that excuses or even glorifies the deliberate killing of innocents. A proud
religion — the religion of Islam — has been twisted and made to serve an evil end, as in
other times and places other religions have been similarly abused.

Defeating terrorism in the long run requires that each of these factors be addressed. The
genius of democracy is that it provides a counter to each.

e In place of alienation, democracy offers an ownership stake in society, a chance to
shape one’s own future.

e Inplace of festering grievances, democracy offers the rule of law, the peaceful
resolution of disputes, and the habits of advancing interests through compromise.

 

10 National Security Strategy

e In place of a culture of conspiracy and misinformation, democracy offers freedom of
speech, independent media, and the marketplace of ideas, which can expose and
discredit falsehoods, prejudices, and dishonest propaganda.

e In place of an ideology that justifies murder, democracy offers a respect for human
dignity that abhors the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians.

Democracy is the opposite of terrorist tyranny, which is why the terrorists denounce it
and are willing to kill the innocent to stop it. Democracy is based on empowerment,
while the terrorists’ ideology is based on enslavement. Democracies expand the freedom
of their citizens, while the terrorists seek to impose a single set of narrow beliefs.
Democracy sees individuals as equal in worth and dignity, having an inherent potential to
create and to govern themselves. The terrorists see individuals as objects to be exploited,
and then to be ruled and oppressed.

Democracies are not immune to terrorism. In some democracies, some ethnic or
religious groups are unable or unwilling to grasp the benefits of freedom otherwise
available in the society. Such groups can evidence the same alienation and despair that
the transnational terrorists exploit in undemocratic states. This accounts for the
emergence in democratic societies of homegrown terrorists such as were responsible for
the bombings in London in July 2005 and for the violence in some other nations. Even in
these cases, the long-term solution remains deepening the reach of democracy so that all
citizens enjoy its benefits.

The strategy to counter the lies behind the terrorists’ ideology is to empower the very
people the terrorists most want to exploit: the faithful followers of Islam. We will
continue to support political reforms that empower peaceful Muslims to practice and
interpret their faith. The most vital work will be done within the Islamic world itself, and
Jordan, Morocco, and Indonesia have begun to make important strides in this effort.
Responsible Islamic leaders need to denounce an ideology that distorts and exploits Islam
for destructive ends and defiles a proud religion.

Many of the Muslim faith are already making this commitment at great personal risk.
They realize they are a target of this ideology of terror. Everywhere we have joined in
the fight against terrorism, Muslim allies have stood beside us, becoming partners in this
vital cause. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have launched effective efforts to capture or kill
the leadership of the al-Qaida network. Afghan troops are in combat against Taliban
remnants. Iraqi soldiers are sacrificing to defeat al-Qaida in their own country. These
brave citizens know the stakes — the survival of their own liberty, the future of their own
region, the justice and humanity of their own traditions — and the United States is proud
to stand beside them.

The advance of freedom and human dignity through democracy is the long-term solution
to the transnational terrorism of today. To create the space and time for that long-term
solution to take root, there are four steps we will take in the short term.

 

National Security Strategy 11

e Prevent attacks by terrorist networks before they occur. A government has no higher
obligation than to protect the lives and livelihoods of its citizens. The hard core of the
terrorists cannot be deterred or reformed; they must be tracked down, killed, or captured.
They must be cut off from the network of individuals and institutions on which they
depend for support. That network must in turn be deterred, disrupted, and disabled by
using a broad range of tools.

e Deny WMD to rogue states and to terrorist allies who would use them without
hesitation. Terrorists have a perverse moral code that glorifies deliberately targeting
innocent civilians. Terrorists try to inflict as many casualties as possible and seek WMD
to this end. Denying terrorists WMD will require new tools and new international
approaches. We are working with partner nations to improve security at vulnerable
nuclear sites worldwide and bolster the ability of states to detect, disrupt, and respond to
terrorist activity involving WMD.

e Deny terrorist groups the support and sanctuary of rogue states. The United States
and its allies in the War on Terror make no distinction between those who commit acts of
terror and those who support and harbor them, because they are equally guilty of murder.
Any government that chooses to be an ally of terror, such as Syria or Iran, has chosen to
be an enemy of freedom, justice, and peace. The world must hold those regimes to
account.

e Deny the terrorists control of any nation that they would use as a base and
launching pad for terror. The terrorists’ goal is to overthrow a rising democracy; claim
a strategic country as a haven for terror; destabilize the Middle East; and strike America
and other free nations with ever-increasing violence. This we can never allow. This is
why success in Afghanistan and Iraq is vital, and why we must prevent terrorists from
exploiting ungoverned areas.

America will lead in this fight, and we will continue to partner with allies and will recruit
new friends to join the battle.

 

 

Afghanistan and Iraq: The Front Lines in the War on Terror
Winning the War on Terror requires winning the battles in Afghanistan and Iraq.

In Afghanistan, the successes already won must be consolidated. A few years ago, Afghanistan
was condemned to a pre-modern nightmare. Now it has held two successful free elections and is
a staunch ally in the war on terror. Much work remains, however, and the Afghan people
deserve the support of the United States and the entire international community.

The terrorists today see Iraq as the central front of their fight against the United States. They
want to defeat America in Iraq and force us to abandon our allies before a stable democratic
government has been established that can provide for its own security. The terrorists believe
they would then have proven that the United States is a waning power and an unreliable friend.
In the chaos of a broken Iraq the terrorists believe they would be able to establish a safe haven

 

 

 

12 National Security Strategy

 

 

like they had in Afghanistan, only this time in the heart of a geopolitically vital region.
Surrendering to the terrorists would likewise hand them a powerful recruiting tool: the
perception that they are the vanguard of history.

When the Iraqi Government, supported by the Coalition, defeats the terrorists, terrorism will be
dealt a critical blow. We will have broken one of al-Qaida’s most formidable factions — the
network headed by Zarqawi — and denied him the safe haven he seeks in Iraq. And the success
of democracy in Iraq will be a launching pad for freedom’s success throughout a region that for
decades has been a source of instability and stagnation.

The Administration has explained in some detail the strategy for helping the Iraqi people defeat
the terrorists and neutralize the insurgency in Iraq. This requires supporting the Iraqi people in
integrating activity along three broad tracks:

Political: Work with Iraqis to:

e Isolate hardened enemy elements who are unwilling to accept a peaceful political process;

e Engage those outside the political process who are willing to turn away from violence and
invite them into that process; and

e Build stable, pluralistic, and effective national institutions that can protect the interests of all
Iraqis.

Security: Work with Iraqi Security Forces to:

e Clear areas of enemy control by remaining on the offensive, killing and capturing enemy
fighters, and denying them safe haven;

e Hold areas freed from enemy control with an adequate Iraqi security force presence that
ensures these areas remain under the control of a peaceful Iraqi Government; and

e Build Iraqi Security Forces and the capacity of local institutions to deliver services, advance
the rule of law, and nurture civil society.

Economic: Work with the Iraqi Government to:

e Restore Iraq’s neglected infrastructure so that Iraqis can meet increasing demand and the
needs of a growing economy;

e Reform Iraq’s economy so that it can be self-sustaining based on market principles; and

e Build the capacity of Iraqi institutions to maintain their infrastructure, rejoin the international
economic community, and improve the general welfare and prosperity of all Iraqis.

Work with Others to Defuse Regional Conflicts

A. Summary of National Security Strategy 2002

Regional conflicts are a bitter legacy from previous decades that continue to affect our
national security interests today. Regional conflicts do not stay isolated for long and
often spread or devolve into humanitarian tragedy or anarchy. Outside parties can exploit
them to further other ends, much as al-Qaida exploited the civil war in Afghanistan. This
means that even if the United States does not have a direct stake in a particular conflict,
our interests are likely to be affected over time. Outsiders generally cannot impose
solutions on parties that are not ready to embrace them, but outsiders can sometimes help
create the conditions under which the parties themselves can take effective action.

B. Current Context: Successes and Challenges

The world has seen remarkable progress on a number of the most difficult regional
conflicts that destroyed millions of lives over decades.

e In Sudan, the United States led international negotiations that peacefully resolved the
20-year conflict between the Government of Sudan and the Sudanese Peoples
Liberation Movement.

e In Liberia, the United States led international efforts to restore peace and bolster
stability after vicious internal conflict.

e Israeli forces have withdrawn from the Gaza Strip and the northern West Bank,
creating the prospect for transforming Israeli-Palestinian relations and underscoring
the need for the Palestinian Authority to stand up an effective, responsible
government.

e Relations between India and Pakistan have improved, with an exchange of high-level
visits and a new spirit of cooperation in the dispute over Kashmir — a cooperation
made more tangible by humanitarian actions undertaken following a destructive
earthquake.

e The cooperative approach to the relief effort following the tsunami that hit Indonesia
resulted in political shifts that helped make possible a peaceful settlement in the bitter
separatist conflict in Aceh.

e In Northern Ireland, the implementation of key parts of the Good Friday Agreement,
including the decommissioning of weapons, marked a substantial milestone in ending

that long-standing civil conflict.

Numerous remaining regional challenges demand the world’s attention:

 

14 National Security Strategy

e In Darfur, the people of an impoverished region are the victims of genocide arising
from a civil war that pits a murderous militia, backed by the Sudanese Government,
against a collection of rebel groups.

e In Colombia, a democratic ally is fighting the persistent assaults of Marxist terrorists
and drug-traffickers.

e In Venezuela, a demagogue awash in oil money is undermining democracy and
seeking to destabilize the region.

e In Cuba, an anti-American dictator continues to oppress his people and seeks to
subvert freedom in the region.

e In Uganda, a barbaric rebel cult — the Lord’s Resistance Army — is exploiting a
regional conflict and terrorizing a vulnerable population.

e In Ethiopia and Eritrea, a festering border dispute threatens to erupt yet again into
open war.

e In Nepal, a vicious Maoist insurgency continues to terrorize the population while the
government retreats from democracy.

C. The Way Ahead

Regional conflicts can arise from a wide variety of causes, including poor governance,
external aggression, competing claims, internal revolt, tribal rivalries, and ethnic or
religious hatreds. If left unaddressed, however, these different causes lead to the same
ends: failed states, humanitarian disasters, and ungoverned areas that can become safe
havens for terrorists.

The Administration’s strategy for addressing regional conflicts includes three levels of
engagement: conflict prevention and resolution; conflict intervention; and post-conflict
stabilization and reconstruction.

Effective international cooperation on these efforts is dependent on capable partners. To
this end, Congress has enacted new authorities that will permit the United States to train
and equip our foreign partners in a more timely and effective manner. Working with
Congress, we will continue to pursue foreign assistance reforms that allow the President
to draw on the skills of agencies across the United States Government.

1. Conflict Prevention and Resolution

The most effective long-term measure for conflict prevention and resolution is the
promotion of democracy. Effective democracies may still have disputes, but they are
equipped to resolve their differences peacefully, either bilaterally or by working with
other regional states or international institutions.

 

National Security Strategy 15

16

In the short term, however, a timely offer by free nations of “good offices” or outside
assistance can sometimes prevent conflict or help resolve conflict once started. Such
early measures can prevent problems from becoming crises and crises from becoming
wars. The United States is ready to play this role when appropriate. Even with outside
help, however, there is no substitute for bold and effective local leadership.

Progress in the short term may also depend upon the stances of key regional actors. The
most effective way to address a problem within one country may be by addressing the
wider regional context. This regional approach has particular application to Israeli-
Palestinian issues, the conflicts in the Great Lakes region of Africa, and the conflict
within Nepal.

2. Conflict Intervention

Some conflicts pose such a grave threat to our broader interests and values that conflict
intervention may be needed to restore peace and stability. Recent experience has
underscored that the international community does not have enough high-quality military
forces trained and capable of performing these peace operations. The Administration has
recognized this need and is working with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
to improve the capacity of states to intervene in conflict situations. We launched the
Global Peace Operations Initiative at the 2004 G-8 Summit to train peacekeepers for duty
in Africa. We are also supporting United Nations (U.N.) reform to improve its ability to
carry out peacekeeping missions with enhanced accountability, oversight, and results-
based management practices.

3. Post-Conflict Stabilization and Reconstruction

Once peace has been restored, the hard work of post-conflict stabilization and
reconstruction must begin. Military involvement may be necessary to stop a bloody
conflict, but peace and stability will last only if follow-on efforts to restore order and
rebuild are successful. The world has found through bitter experience that success often
depends on the early establishment of strong local institutions such as effective police
forces and a functioning justice and penal system. This governance capacity is critical to
establishing the rule of law and a free market economy, which provide long-term stability
and prosperity.

To develop these capabilities, the Administration established a new office in the
Department of State, the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization,
to plan and execute civilian stabilization and reconstruction efforts. The office draws on
all agencies of the government and integrates its activities with our military’s efforts.
The office will also coordinate United States Government efforts with other governments
building similar capabilities (such as the United Kingdom, Canada, the EU, and others),
as well as with new international efforts such as the U.N. Peacebuilding Commission.

4. Genocide

Patient efforts to end conflicts should not be mistaken for tolerance of the intolerable.
Genocide is the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial, or religious
group. The world needs to start honoring a principle that many believe has lost its force
in parts of the international community in recent years: genocide must not be tolerated.

It is a moral imperative that states take action to prevent and punish genocide. History
teaches that sometimes other states will not act unless America does its part. We must
refine United States Government efforts — economic, diplomatic, and law-enforcement —
so that they target those individuals responsible for genocide and not the innocent citizens
they rule. Where perpetrators of mass killing defy all attempts at peaceful intervention,
armed intervention may be required, preferably by the forces of several nations working
together under appropriate regional or international auspices.

We must not allow the legal debate over the technical definition of “genocide” to excuse

inaction. The world must act in cases of mass atrocities and mass killing that will
eventually lead to genocide even if the local parties are not prepared for peace.

17

V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends with
Weapons of Mass Destruction

A. Summary of National Security Strategy 2002

The security environment confronting the United States today is radically different from
what we have faced before. Yet the first duty of the United States Government remains
what it always has been: to protect the American people and American interests. It is an
enduring American principle that this duty obligates the government to anticipate and
counter threats, using all elements of national power, before the threats can do grave
damage. The greater the threat, the greater is the risk of inaction — and the more
compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if uncertainty
remains as to the time and place of the enemy’s attack. There are few greater threats than
a terrorist attack with WMD.

To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United States will, if
necessary, act preemptively in exercising our inherent right of self-defense. The United
States will not resort to force in all cases to preempt emerging threats. Our preference is
that nonmilitary actions succeed. And no country should ever use preemption as a
pretext for aggression.

Countering proliferation of WMD requires a comprehensive strategy involving
strengthened nonproliferation efforts to deny these weapons of terror and related
expertise to those seeking them; proactive counterproliferation efforts to defend against
and defeat WMD and missile threats before they are unleashed; and improved protection
to mitigate the consequences of WMD use. We aim to convince our adversaries that they
cannot achieve their goals with WMD, and thus deter and dissuade them from attempting
to use or even acquire these weapons in the first place.

B. Current Context: Successes and Challenges

We have worked hard to protect our citizens and our security. The United States has
worked extensively with the international community and key partners to achieve
common objectives.

e The United States has begun fielding ballistic missile defenses to deter and protect the
United States from missile attacks by rogue states armed with WMD. The fielding of
such missile defenses was made possible by the United States’ withdrawal from the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which was done in accordance with the treaty’s
provisions.

e In May 2003, the Administration launched the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI),
a global effort that aims to stop shipments of WMD, their delivery systems, and
related material. More than 70 countries have expressed support for this initiative,
and it has enjoyed several successes in impeding WMD trafficking.

 

18 National Security Strategy

e United States leadership in extensive law enforcement and intelligence cooperation
involving several countries led to the roll-up of the A.Q. Khan nuclear network.

e Libya voluntarily agreed to eliminate its WMD programs shortly after a PSI
interdiction of a shipment of nuclear-related material from the A.Q. Khan network to
Libya.

e The United States led in securing passage in April 2004 of United Nations Security
Council (UNSC) Resolution 1540, requiring nations to criminalize WMD
proliferation and institute effective export and financial controls.

e We have led the effort to strengthen the ability of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) to detect and respond to nuclear proliferation.

e The Administration has established a new comprehensive framework, Biodefense for
the 21"" Century, incorporating innovative initiatives to protect the United States
against bioterrorism.

Nevertheless, serious challenges remain:

e Iran has violated its Non-Proliferation Treaty safeguards obligations and refuses to
provide objective guarantees that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes.

e The DPRK continues to destabilize its region and defy the international community,
now boasting a small nuclear arsenal and an illicit nuclear program in violation of its
international obligations.

e Terrorists, including those associated with the al-Qaida network, continue to pursue
WMD.

e Some of the world’s supply of weapons-grade fissile material — the necessary
ingredient for making nuclear weapons — is not properly protected.

e Advances in biotechnology provide greater opportunities for state and non-state
actors to obtain dangerous pathogens and equipment.

C. The Way Ahead

We are committed to keeping the world’s most dangerous weapons out of the hands of
the world’s most dangerous people.

1. Nuclear Proliferation
The proliferation of nuclear weapons poses the greatest threat to our national security.

Nuclear weapons are unique in their capacity to inflict instant loss of life on a massive
scale. For this reason, nuclear weapons hold special appeal to rogue states and terrorists.

 

National Security Strategy 19

The best way to block aspiring nuclear states or nuclear terrorists is to deny them access
to the essential ingredient of fissile material. It is much harder to deny states or terrorists
other key components, for nuclear weapons represent a 60-year old technology and the
knowledge is widespread. Therefore, our strategy focuses on controlling fissile material
with two priority objectives: first, to keep states from acquiring the capability to produce
fissile material suitable for making nuclear weapons; and second, to deter, interdict, or
prevent any transfer of that material from states that have this capability to rogue states or
to terrorists.

The first objective requires closing a loophole in the Non-Proliferation Treaty that
permits regimes to produce fissile material that can be used to make nuclear weapons
under cover of a civilian nuclear power program. To close this loophole, we have
proposed that the world’s leading nuclear exporters create a safe, orderly system that
spreads nuclear energy without spreading nuclear weapons. Under this system, all states
would have reliable access at reasonable cost to fuel for civilian nuclear power reactors.
In return, those states would remain transparent and renounce the enrichment and
reprocessing capabilities that can produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In this
way, enrichment and reprocessing will not be necessary for nations seeking to harness
nuclear energy for strictly peaceful purposes.

The Administration has worked with the international community in confronting nuclear
proliferation.

We may face no greater challenge from a single country than from Iran. For almost 20
years, the Iranian regime hid many of its key nuclear efforts from the international
community. Yet the regime continues to claim that it does not seek to develop nuclear
weapons. The Iranian regime’s true intentions are clearly revealed by the regime’s
refusal to negotiate in good faith; its refusal to come into compliance with its
international obligations by providing the IAEA access to nuclear sites and resolving
troubling questions; and the aggressive statements of its President calling for Israel to “be
wiped off the face of the earth.” The United States has joined with our EU partners and
Russia to pressure Iran to meet its international obligations and provide objective
guarantees that its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes. This diplomatic effort
must succeed if confrontation is to be avoided.

As important as are these nuclear issues, the United States has broader concerns
regarding Iran. The Iranian regime sponsors terrorism; threatens Israel; seeks to thwart
Middle East peace; disrupts democracy in Iraq; and denies the aspirations of its people
for freedom. The nuclear issue and our other concerns can ultimately be resolved only if
the Iranian regime makes the strategic decision to change these policies, open up its
political system, and afford freedom to its people. This is the ultimate goal of U.S.
policy. In the interim, we will continue to take all necessary measures to protect our
national and economic security against the adverse effects of their bad conduct. The
problems lie with the illicit behavior and dangerous ambition of the Iranian regime, not
the legitimate aspirations and interests of the Iranian people. Our strategy is to block the

 

20 National Security Strategy

threats posed by the regime while expanding our engagement and outreach to the people
the regime is oppressing.

The North Korean regime also poses a serious nuclear proliferation challenge. It presents
a long and bleak record of duplicity and bad-faith negotiations. In the past, the regime
has attempted to split the United States from its allies. This time, the United States has
successfully forged a consensus among key regional partners — China, Japan, Russia, and
the Republic of Korea (ROK) — that the DPRK must give up all of its existing nuclear
programs. Regional cooperation offers the best hope for a peaceful, diplomatic resolution
of this problem. In a joint statement signed on September 19, 2005, in the Six-Party
Talks among these participants, the DPRK agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons and all
existing nuclear programs. The joint statement also declared that the relevant parties
would negotiate a permanent peace for the Korean peninsula and explore ways to
promote security cooperation in Asia. Along with our partners in the Six-Party Talks, the
United States will continue to press the DPRK to implement these commitments.

The United States has broader concerns regarding the DPRK as well. The DPRK
counterfeits our currency; traffics in narcotics and engages in other illicit activities;
threatens the ROK with its army and its neighbors with its missiles; and brutalizes and
starves its people. The DPRK regime needs to change these policies, open up its political
system, and afford freedom to its people. In the interim, we will continue to take all
necessary measures to protect our national and economic security against the adverse
effects of their bad conduct.

The second nuclear proliferation objective is to keep fissile material out of the hands
of rogue states and terrorists. To do this we must address the danger posed by
inadequately safeguarded nuclear and radiological materials worldwide. The
Administration is leading a global effort to reduce and secure such materials as quickly as
possible through several initiatives including the Global Threat Reduction Initiative
(GTRI). The GTRI locates, tracks, and reduces existing stockpiles of nuclear material.
This new initiative also discourages trafficking in nuclear material by emplacing
detection equipment at key transport nodes.

Building on the success of the PSI, the United States is also leading international efforts
to shut down WMD trafficking by targeting key maritime and air transportation and
transshipment routes, and by cutting off proliferators from financial resources that
support their activities.

2. Biological Weapons

Biological weapons also pose a grave WMD threat because of the risks of contagion that
would spread disease across large populations and around the globe. Unlike nuclear
weapons, biological weapons do not require hard-to-acquire infrastructure or materials.
This makes the challenge of controlling their spread even greater.

 

National Security Strategy 21

Countering the spread of biological weapons requires a strategy focused on improving
our capacity to detect and respond to biological attacks, securing dangerous pathogens,
and limiting the spread of materials useful for biological weapons. The United States is
working with partner nations and institutions to strengthen global biosurveillance
capabilities for early detection of suspicious outbreaks of disease. We have launched
new initiatives at home to modernize our public health infrastructure and to encourage
industry to speed the development of new classes of vaccines and medical
countermeasures. This will also enhance our Nation’s ability to respond to pandemic
public health threats, such as avian influenza.

3. Chemical Weapons

Chemical weapons are a serious proliferation concern and are actively sought by
terrorists, including al-Qaida. Much like biological weapons, the threat from chemical
weapons increases with advances in technology, improvements in agent development,
and ease in acquisition of materials and equipment.

To deter and defend against such threats, we work to identify and disrupt terrorist
networks that seek chemical weapons capabilities, and seek to deny them access to
materials needed to make these weapons. We are improving our detection and other
chemical defense capabilities at home and abroad, including ensuring that U.S. military
forces and emergency responders are trained and equipped to manage the consequences
of a chemical weapons attack.

4. The Need for Action

The new strategic environment requires new approaches to deterrence and defense. Our
deterrence strategy no longer rests primarily on the grim premise of inflicting devastating
consequences on potential foes. Both offenses and defenses are necessary to deter state
and non-state actors, through denial of the objectives of their attacks and, if necessary,
responding with overwhelming force.

Safe, credible, and reliable nuclear forces continue to play a critical role. We are
strengthening deterrence by developing a New Triad composed of offensive strike
systems (both nuclear and improved conventional capabilities); active and passive
defenses, including missile defenses; and a responsive infrastructure, all bound together
by enhanced command and control, planning, and intelligence systems. These
capabilities will better deter some of the new threats we face, while also bolstering our
security commitments to allies. Such security commitments have played a crucial role in
convincing some countries to forgo their own nuclear weapons programs, thereby aiding
our nonproliferation objectives.

Deterring potential foes and assuring friends and allies, however, is only part of a broader
approach. Meeting WMD proliferation challenges also requires effective international
action — and the international community is most engaged in such action when the United
States leads.

 

22 National Security Strategy

Taking action need not involve military force. Our strong preference and common
practice is to address proliferation concerns through international diplomacy, in concert
with key allies and regional partners. If necessary, however, under long-standing
principles of self defense, we do not rule out the use of force before attacks occur, even if
uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy’s attack. When the
consequences of an attack with WMD are potentially so devastating, we cannot afford to
stand idly by as grave dangers materialize. This is the principle and logic of preemption.
The place of preemption in our national security strategy remains the same. We will
always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our actions. The reasons for
our actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.

 

 

Iraq and Weapons of Mass Destruction

This Administration inherited an Iraq threat that was unresolved. In early 2001, the international
support for U.N. sanctions and continued limits on the Iraqi regime’s weapons-related activity
was eroding, and key UNSC members were asking that they be lifted.

For America, the September 11 attacks underscored the danger of allowing threats to linger
unresolved. Saddam Hussein’s continued defiance of 16 UNSC resolutions over 12 years,
combined with his record of invading neighboring countries, supporting terrorists, tyrannizing
his own people, and using chemical weapons, presented a threat we could no longer ignore.

The UNSC unanimously passed Resolution 1441 on November 8, 2002, calling for full and
immediate compliance by the Iraqi regime with its disarmament obligations. Once again,
Saddam defied the international community. According to the Iraq Survey Group, the team of
inspectors that went into Iraq after Saddam Hussein was toppled and whose report provides the
fullest accounting of the Iraqi regime’s illicit activities:

“Saddam continued to see the utility ofp WMD. He explained that he purposely gave an
ambiguous impression about possession as a deterrent to Iran. He gave explicit direction to
maintain the intellectual capabilities. As U.N. sanctions eroded there was a concomitant
expansion of activities that could support full WMD reactivation. He directed that ballistic
missile work continue that would support long-range missile development. Virtually no senior
Iraqi believed that Saddam had forsaken WMD forever. Evidence suggests that, as resources
became available and the constraints of sanctions decayed, there was a direct expansion of
activity that would have the effect of supporting future WMD reconstitution. ”

With the elimination of Saddam’s regime, this threat has been addressed, once and for all.

The Iraq Survey Group also found that pre-war intelligence estimates of Iraqi WMD stockpiles
were wrong — a conclusion that has been confirmed by a bipartisan commission and
congressional investigations. We must learn from this experience if we are to counter
successfully the very real threat of proliferation.

First, our intelligence must improve. The President and the Congress have taken steps to
reorganize and strengthen the U.S. intelligence community. A single, accountable leader of the

 

National Security Strategy 23

 

 

intelligence community with authorities to match his responsibilities, and increased sharing of
information and increased resources, are helping realize this objective.

Second, there will always be some uncertainty about the status of hidden programs since
proliferators are often brutal regimes that go to great lengths to conceal their activities. Indeed,
prior to the 1991 Gulf War, many intelligence analysts underestimated the WMD threat posed by
the Iraqi regime. After that conflict, they were surprised to learn how far Iraq had progressed
along various pathways to try to produce fissile material.

Third, Saddam’s strategy of bluff, denial, and deception is a dangerous game that dictators
play at their peril. The world offered Saddam a clear choice: effect full and immediate
compliance with his disarmament obligations or face serious consequences. Saddam chose the
latter course and is now facing judgment in an Iraqi court. It was Saddam’s reckless behavior
that demanded the world’s attention, and it was his refusal to remove the ambiguity that he
created that forced the United States and its allies to act. We have no doubt that the world is a
better place for the removal of this dangerous and unpredictable tyrant, and we have no doubt
that the world is better off if tyrants know that they pursue WMD at their own peril.

VI.

Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and Free
Trade

A. Summary of National Security Strategy 2002

Promoting free and fair trade has long been a bedrock tenet of American foreign policy.
Greater economic freedom is ultimately inseparable from political liberty. Economic
freedom empowers individuals, and empowered individuals increasingly demand greater
political freedom. Greater economic freedom also leads to greater economic opportunity
and prosperity for everyone. History has judged the market economy as the single most
effective economic system and the greatest antidote to poverty. To expand economic
liberty and prosperity, the United States promotes free and fair trade, open markets, a
stable financial system, the integration of the global economy, and secure, clean energy
development.

B. Current Context: Successes and Challenges

The global economy is more open and free, and many people around the world have seen
their lives improve as prosperity and economic integration have increased. The
Administration has accomplished much of the economic freedom agenda it set out in
2002:

Seizing the global initiative. We have worked to open markets and integrate the global
economy through launching the Doha Development Agenda negotiations of the World
Trade Organization (WTO). The United States put forward bold and historic proposals to
reform global agricultural trade, to eliminate farm export subsidies and reduce trade-
distorting support programs, to eliminate all tariffs on consumer and industrial goods, and
to open global services markets. When negotiations stalled in 2003, the United States
took the initiative to put Doha back on track, culminating in a successful framework
agreement reached in Geneva in 2004. As talks proceed, the United States continues to
lead the world in advancing bold proposals for economic freedom through open markets.
We also have led the way in helping the accessions of new WTO members such as
Armenia, Cambodia, Macedonia, and Saudi Arabia.

Pressing regional and bilateral trade initiatives. We have used FTAs to open markets,
support economic reform and the rule of law, and create new opportunities for American
farmers and workers. Since 2001, we have:

e Implemented or completed negotiations for FTAs with 14 countries on 5 continents,
and are negotiating agreements with 11 additional countries;

e Partnered with Congress to pass the Central America Free Trade Agreement —
Dominican Republic (CAFTA-DR), long sought by the leaders of El Salvador,
Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Dominican Republic;

 

National Security Strategy 25

e Called in 2003 for the creation of a Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA) by 2013
to bring the Middle East into an expanding circle of opportunity;

e Negotiated FTAs with Bahrain, Jordan, Morocco, and Oman to provide a foundation
for the MEFTA initiative;

e Launched in 2002 the Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative, which led to the completion
of a free trade agreement with Singapore, and the launch of negotiations with
Thailand and Malaysia;

e Concluded an FTA with Australia, one of America’s strongest allies in the Asia-
Pacific region and a major trading partner of the United States; and

e Continued to promote the opportunities of increased trade to sub-Saharan Africa
through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and extended opportunity
to many other developing countries through the Generalized System of Preferences.

Pressing for open markets, financial stability, and deeper integration of the world
economy. We have partnered with Europe, Japan, and other major economies to promote
structural reforms that encourage growth, stability, and opportunity across the globe. The
United States has:

e Gained agreement in the G-7 on the Agenda for Growth, which commits member
states to take concrete steps to reform domestic economic systems;

e Worked with other nations that serve as regional and global engines of growth — such
as India, China, the ROK, Brazil, and Russia — on reforms to open markets and ensure
financial stability;

e Urged China to move to a market-based, flexible exchange rate regime — a step that
would help both China and the global economy; and

e Pressed for reform of the International Financial Institutions to focus on results,
fostering good governance and sound policies, and freeing poor countries from
unpayable debts.

Enhancing energy security and clean development. The Administration has worked
with trading partners and energy producers to expand the types and sources of energy, to
open markets and strengthen the rule of law, and to foster private investment that can
help develop the energy needed to meet global demand. In addition, we have:

e Worked with industrialized and emerging nations on hydrogen, clean coal, and
advanced nuclear technologies; and

26

e Joined with Australia, China, India, Japan, and the ROK in forming the Asia-Pacific
Partnership for Clean Development and Climate to accelerate deployment of clean
technologies to enhance energy security, reduce poverty, and reduce pollution.

Several challenges remain:

e Protectionist impulses in many countries put at risk the benefits of open markets and
impede the expansion of free and fair trade and economic growth.

e Nations that lack the rule of law are prone to corruption, lack of transparency, and
poor governance. These nations frustrate the economic aspirations of their people by
failing to promote entrepreneurship, protect intellectual property, or allow their
citizens access to vital investment capital.

e Many countries are too dependent upon foreign oil, which is often imported from
unstable parts of the world.

e Economic integration spreads wealth across the globe, but also makes local
economies more subject to global market conditions.

e Some governments restrict the free flow of capital, subverting the vital role that wise
investment can play in promoting economic growth. This denies investments,
economic opportunity, and new jobs to the people who need them most.

C. The Way Ahead

Economic freedom is a moral imperative. The liberty to create and build or to buy, sell,
and own property is fundamental to human nature and foundational to a free society.
Economic freedom also reinforces political freedom. It creates diversified centers of
power and authority that limit the reach of government. It expands the free flow of ideas;
with increased trade and foreign investment comes exposure to new ways of thinking and
living which give citizens more control over their own lives.

To continue extending liberty and prosperity, and to meet the challenges that remain, our
strategy going forward involves:

1. Opening markets and integrating developing countries.

While most of the world affirms in principle the appeal of economic liberty, in practice
too many nations hold fast to the false comforts of subsidies and trade barriers. Such
distortions of the market stifle growth in developed countries, and slow the escape from
poverty in developing countries. Against these short-sighted impulses, the United States
promotes the enduring vision of a global economy that welcomes all participants and
encourages the voluntary exchange of goods and services based on mutual benefit, not
favoritism.

27

We will continue to advance this agenda through the WTO and through bilateral and
regional FTAs.

e The United States will seek completion of the Doha Development Agenda
negotiations. A successful Doha agreement will expand opportunities for Americans
and for others around the world. Trade and open markets will empower citizens in
developing countries to improve their lives, while reducing the opportunities for
corruption that afflict state-controlled economies.

e We will continue to work with countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and
Vietnam on the market reforms needed to join the WTO. Participation in the WTO
brings opportunities as well as obligations — to strengthen the rule of law and honor
the intellectual property rights that sustain the modern knowledge economy, and to
remove tariffs, subsidies, and other trade barriers that distort global markets and harm
the world’s poor.

e We will advance MEFTA by completing and bringing into force FTAs for Bahrain,
Oman, and the United Arab Emirates and through other initiatives to expand open
trade with and among countries in the region.

e In Africa, we are pursuing an FTA with the countries of the Southern African
Customs Union: Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland.

e In Asia, we are pursuing FTAs with Thailand, the ROK, and Malaysia. We will also
continue to work closely with China to ensure it honors its WTO commitments and
protects intellectual property.

e In our own hemisphere, we will advance the vision of a free trade area of the
Americas by building on North American Free Trade Agreement, CAFTA-DR, and
the FTA with Chile. We will complete and bring into force FTAs with Colombia,
Peru, Ecuador, and Panama.

2. Opening, integrating, and diversifying energy markets to ensure energy
independence.

Most of the energy that drives the global economy comes from fossil fuels, especially
petroleum. The United States is the world’s third largest oil producer, but we rely on
international sources to supply more than 50 percent of our needs. Only a small number
of countries make major contributions to the world’s oil supply.

The world’s dependence on these few suppliers is neither responsible nor sustainable
over the long term. The key to ensuring our energy security is diversity in the regions
from which energy resources come and in the types of energy resources on which we
rely.

 

28 National Security Strategy

e The Administration will work with resource-rich countries to increase their openness,
transparency, and rule of law. This will promote effective democratic governance
and attract the investment essential to developing their resources and expanding the
range of energy suppliers.

e We will build the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership to work with other nations to
develop and deploy advanced nuclear recycling and reactor technologies. This
initiative will help provide reliable, emission-free energy with less of the waste
burden of older technologies and without making available separated plutonium that
could be used by rogue states or terrorists for nuclear weapons. These new
technologies will make possible a dramatic expansion of safe, clean nuclear energy to
help meet the growing global energy demand.

e We will work with international partners to develop other transformational
technologies such as clean coal and hydrogen. Through projects like our FutureGen
initiative, we seek to turn our abundant domestic coal into emissions-free sources of
electricity and hydrogen, providing our economies increased power with decreased
emissions.

e On the domestic front, we are investing in zero-emission coal-fired plants;
revolutionary solar and wind technologies; clean, safe nuclear energy; and cutting-
edge methods of producing ethanol.

Our comprehensive energy strategy puts a priority on reducing our reliance on foreign
energy sources. Diversification of energy sources also will help alleviate the “petroleum
curse” — the tendency for oil revenues to foster corruption and prevent economic growth
and political reform in some oil-producing states. In too many such nations, ruling elites
enrich themselves while denying the people the benefits of their countries’ natural
wealth. In the worst cases, oil revenues fund activities that destabilize their regions or
advance violent ideologies. Diversifying the suppliers within and across regions reduces
opportunities for corruption and diminishes the leverage of irresponsible rulers.

3. Reforming the International Financial System to Ensure Stability and Growth

In our interconnected world, stable and open financial markets are an essential feature of
a prosperous global economy. We will work to improve the stability and openness of
markets by:

e Promoting Growth-Oriented Economic Policies Worldwide. Sound policies in the
United States have helped drive much international growth. We cannot be the only
source of strength, however. We will work with the world’s other major economies,
including the EU and Japan, to promote structural reforms that open their markets and
increase productivity in their nations and across the world.

e Encouraging Adoption of Flexible Exchange Rates and Open Markets for
Financial Services. The United States will help emerging economies make the

 

National Security Strategy 29

transition to the flexible exchange rates appropriate for major economies. In
particular, we will continue to urge China to meet its own commitment to a market-
based, flexible exchange rate regime. We will also promote more open financial
service markets, which encourage stable and sound financial practices.

e Strengthening International Financial Institutions. At the dawn of a previous era
6 decades ago, the United States championed the creation of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). These institutions were instrumental in the
development of the global economy and an expansion of prosperity unprecedented in
world history. They remain vital today, but must adapt to new realities:

e For the World Bank and regional development banks, we will encourage greater
emphasis on investments in the private sector. We will urge more consideration
of economic freedom, governance, and measurable results in allocating funds.
We will promote an increased use of grants to relieve the burden of unsustainable
debt.

e For the IMF, we will seek to refocus it on its core mission: international financial
stability. This means strengthening the IMF’s ability to monitor the financial
system to prevent crises before they happen. If crises occur, the IMF’s response
must reinforce each country’s responsibility for its own economic choices. A
refocused IMF will strengthen market institutions and market discipline over
financial decisions, helping to promote a stable and prosperous global economy.
By doing so, over time markets and the private sector can supplant the need for
the IMF to perform in its current role.

e Building Local Capital Markets and the Formal Economy in the Developing
World. The first place that small businesses in developing countries turn to for
resources is their own domestic markets. Unfortunately, in too many countries these
resources are unavailable due to weak financial systems, a lack of property rights, and
the diversion of economic activity away from the formal economy into the black
market. The United States will work with these countries to develop and strengthen
local capital markets and reduce the black market. This will provide more resources
to helping the public sector govern effectively and the private sector grow and
prosper.

e Creating a More Transparent, Accountable, and Secure International Financial
System. The United States has worked with public and private partners to help
secure the international financial system against abuse by criminals, terrorists, money
launderers, and corrupt political leaders. We will continue to use international venues
like the Financial Action Task Force to ensure that this global system is transparent
and protected from abuse by tainted capital. We must also develop new tools that
allow us to detect, disrupt, and isolate rogue financial players and gatekeepers.

Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building the
Infrastructure of Democracy

A. Summary of National Security Strategy 2002

Helping the world’s poor is a strategic priority and a moral imperative. Economic
development, responsible governance, and individual liberty are intimately connected.
Past foreign assistance to corrupt and ineffective governments failed to help the
populations in greatest need. Instead, it often impeded democratic reform and
encouraged corruption. The United States must promote development programs that
achieve measurable results — rewarding reforms, encouraging transparency, and
improving people’s lives. Led by the United States, the international community has
endorsed this approach in the Monterrey Consensus.

B. Current Context: Successes and Challenges

The United States has improved the lives of millions of people and transformed the
practice of development by adopting more effective policies and programs.

e Advancing Development and Reinforcing Reform. The Administration pioneered
a revolution in development strategy with the Millennium Challenge Account
program, rewarding countries that govern justly, invest in their people, and foster
economic freedom. The program is based on the principle that each nation bears the
responsibility for its own development. It offers governments the opportunity and the
means to undertake transformational change by designing their own reform and
development programs, which are then funded through the Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC). The MCC has approved over $1.5 billion for compacts in eight
countries, is working with over a dozen other countries on compacts, and has
committed many smaller grants to other partner countries.

e Turning the Tide Against AIDS and Other Infectious Diseases. The President’s
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is an unprecedented, 5-year, $15 billion effort.
Building on the success of pioneering programs in Africa, we have launched a major
initiative that will prevent 7 million new infections, provide treatment to 2 million
infected individuals, and care for 10 million AIDS orphans and others affected by the
disease. We have launched a $1.2 billion, 5-year initiative to reduce malaria deaths
by 50 percent in at least 15 targeted countries. To mobilize other nations and the
private sector, the United States pioneered the creation of the Global Fund to Fight
HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. We are the largest donor to the Fund and
have already contributed over $1.4 billion.

e Promoting Debt Sustainability and a Path Toward Private Capital Markets. The
Administration has sought to break the burden of debt that traps many poor countries
by encouraging international financial institutions to provide grants instead of loans
to low-income nations. With the United Kingdom, we spearheaded the G-8 initiative
to provide 100 percent multilateral debt relief to qualifying Heavily Indebted Poor

 

National Security Strategy 31

Countries. Reducing debt to sustainable levels allows countries to focus on
immediate development challenges. In the long run, reducing debt also opens access
to private capital markets which foster sound policies and long-term growth.

e Addressing Urgent Needs and Investing in People. The United States leads the
world in providing food relief. We launched the Initiative to End Hunger in Africa,
using science, technology, and market incentives to increase the productivity of
African farmers. We launched a 3-year, $900 million initiative to provide clean water
to the poor. We have tripled basic education assistance through programs such as the
Africa Education Initiative, which will train teachers and administrators, build
schools, buy textbooks, and expand opportunities inside and outside the classroom.

e Unleashing the Power of the Private Sector. The Administration has sought to
multiply the impact of our development assistance through initiatives such as the
Global Development Alliance, which forges partnerships with the private sector to
advance development goals, and Volunteers for Prosperity, which enlists some of our
Nation’s most capable professionals to serve strategically in developing nations.

e Fighting Corruption and Promoting Transparency. Through multilateral efforts
like the G-8 Transparency Initiative and our policy of denying corrupt foreign
officials entry into the United States, we are helping ensure that organized crime and
parasitic rulers do not choke off the benefits of economic assistance and growth.

We have increased our overall development assistance spending by 97 percent since
2000. In all of these efforts, the United States has sought concrete measures of success.
Funding is a means, not the end. We are giving more money to help the world’s poor,
and giving it more effectively.

Many challenges remain, including:

e Helping millions of people in the world who continue to suffer from poverty and
disease;

e Ensuring that the delivery of assistance reinforces good governance and sound
economic policies; and

e Building the capacity of poor countries to take ownership of their own development
strategies.

C. The Way Ahead

America’s national interests and moral values drive us in the same direction: to assist the
world’s poor citizens and least developed nations and help integrate them into the global
economy. We have accomplished many of the goals laid out in the 2002 National
Security Strategy. Many of the new initiatives we launched in the last 4 years are now

 

32 National Security Strategy

fully operating to help the plight of the world’s least fortunate. We will persevere on this
path.

Development reinforces diplomacy and defense, reducing long-term threats to our
national security by helping to build stable, prosperous, and peaceful societies.
Improving the way we use foreign assistance will make it more effective in strengthening
responsible governments, responding to suffering, and improving people’s lives.

1. Transformational Diplomacy and Effective Democracy

Transformational diplomacy means working with our many international partners to build
and sustain democratic, well-governed states that will respond to the needs of their
citizens and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system. Long-term
development must include encouraging governments to make wise choices and assisting
them in implementing those choices. We will encourage and reward good behavior
rather than reinforce negative behavior. Ultimately it is the countries themselves that
must decide to take the necessary steps toward development, yet we will help advance
this process by creating external incentives for governments to reform themselves.

Effective economic development advances our national security by helping promote
responsible sovereignty, not permanent dependency. Weak and impoverished states and
ungoverned areas are not only a threat to their people and a burden on regional
economies, but are also susceptible to exploitation by terrorists, tyrants, and international
criminals. We will work to bolster threatened states, provide relief in times of crisis, and
build capacity in developing states to increase their progress.

2. Making Foreign Assistance More Effective

The Administration has created the new position of Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA)
in the State Department. The DFA will serve concurrently as Administrator of U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID), a position that will continue to be at the
level of Deputy Secretary, and will have, consistent with existing legal requirements,
authority over all State Department and USAID foreign assistance. This reorganization
will create a more unified and rational structure that will more fully align assistance
programs in State and USAID, increase the effectiveness of these programs for recipient
countries, and ensure that we are being the best possible stewards of taxpayer dollars.
And it will focus our foreign assistance on promoting greater ownership and
responsibility on the part of host nations and their citizens.

With this new authority, the DFA/Administrator will develop a coordinated foreign
assistance strategy, including 5-year, country-specific assistance strategies and annual
country-specific assistance operational plans. The DFA/Administrator also will provide
guidance for the assistance delivered through other entities of the United States
Government, including the MCC and the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator.

 

National Security Strategy 33

To ensure the best stewardship of our foreign assistance, the United States will:

e Distinguish among the different challenges facing different nations and address those
challenges with tools appropriate for each country’s stage of development;

e Encourage and reward good government and economic reform, both bilaterally and
through the multilateral institutions such as international financial institutions, the
G-8, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC);

e Engage the private sector to help solve development problems;

e Promote graduation from economic aid dependency with the ultimate goal of ending
assistance;

e Build trade capacity to enable the poorest countries to enter into the global trade
system; and

e Empower local leaders to take responsibility for their country’s development.
Our assistance efforts will also highlight and build on the lessons learned from successful

examples of wise development and economic policy choices, such as the ROK, Taiwan,
Ireland, Poland, Slovakia, Chile, and Botswana.

Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers of Global
Power

A. Summary of National Security Strategy 2002

Relations with the most powerful countries in the world are central to our national
security strategy. Our priority is pursuing American interests within cooperative
relationships, particularly with our oldest and closest friends and allies. At the same
time, we must seize the opportunity — unusual in historical terms — of an absence of
fundamental conflict between the great powers. Another priority, therefore, is preventing
the reemergence of the great power rivalries that divided the world in previous eras. New
times demand new approaches, flexible enough to permit effective action even when
there are reasonable differences of opinions among friends, yet strong enough to confront
the challenges the world faces.

B. Current Context: Successes and Challenges

The United States has enjoyed unprecedented levels of cooperation on many of its
highest national security priorities:

e The global coalition against terror has grown and deepened, with extensive
cooperation and common resolve. The nations that have partnered with us in
Afghanistan and Iraq have developed capabilities that can be applied to other
challenges.

e We have joined with other nations around the world as well as numerous multilateral
organizations to improve the capability of all nations to defend their homelands
against terrorists and transnational criminals.

e We have achieved extraordinary coordination among historic rivals in pressing the
DPRK to abandon its nuclear program.

e We have partnered with European allies and international institutions to pressure Iran
to honor its non-proliferation commitments.

e The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is transforming itself to meet
current threats and is playing a leading role in stabilizing the Balkans and
Afghanistan, as well as training the Iraqi military leadership to address its security
challenges.

e We have set aside decades of mistrust and put relations with India, the world’s most
populous democracy, on a new and fruitful path.

At the same time, America’s relations with other nations have been strong enough to
withstand differences and candid exchanges of views.

 

National Security Strategy 35

36

Some of our oldest and closest friends disagreed with U.S. policy in Iraq. There are
ongoing and serious debates with our allies about how best to address the unique and
evolving nature of the global terrorist threat.

We have disagreed on the steps to reduce agricultural subsidies and achieve success
in the WTO Doha Round of trade negotiations. We have also faced challenges in
forging consensus with other major nations on the most effective measures to protect
the environment.

C. The Way Ahead

The struggle against militant Islamic radicalism is the great ideological conflict of the
early years of the 21* century and finds the great powers all on the same side — opposing

the terrorists. This circumstance differs profoundly from the ideological struggles of the

20"" century, which saw the great powers divided by ideology as well as by national
interest.

The potential for great power consensus presents the United States with an extraordinary
opportunity. Yet certain challenges must be overcome. Some nations differ with us on

the appropriate pace of change. Other nations provide rhetorical support for free markets

and effective democracy but little action on freedom’s behalf.

Five principles undergird our strategy for relations with the main centers of global power.

First, these relations must be set in their proper context. Bilateral policies that ignore
regional and global realities are unlikely to succeed.

Second, these relations must be supported by appropriate institutions, regional and
global, to make cooperation more permanent, effective, and wide-reaching. Where
existing institutions can be reformed to meet new challenges, we, along with our
partners, must reform them. Where appropriate institutions do not exist, we, along
with our partners, must create them.

Third, we cannot pretend that our interests are unaffected by states’ treatment of their
own citizens. America’s interest in promoting effective democracies rests on an
historical fact: states that are governed well are most inclined to behave well. We
will encourage all our partners to expand liberty, and to respect the rule of law and
the dignity of the individual, as the surest way to advance the welfare of their people
and to cement close relations with the United States.

Fourth, while we do not seek to dictate to other states the choices they make, we do
seek to influence the calculations on which these choices are based. We also must
hedge appropriately in case states choose unwisely.

e Fifth, we must be prepared to act alone if necessary, while recognizing that there is
little of lasting consequence that we can accomplish in the world without the
sustained cooperation of our allies and partners.

1. The Western Hemisphere

These principles guide our relations within our own Hemisphere, the frontline of defense
of American national security. Our goal remains a hemisphere fully democratic, bound
together by good will, security cooperation, and the opportunity for all our citizens to
prosper. Tyrants and those who would follow them belong to a different era and must not
be allowed to reverse the progress of the last two decades. Countries in the Hemisphere
must be helped to the path of sustained political and economic development. The
deceptive appeal of anti-free market populism must not be allowed to erode political
freedoms and trap the Hemisphere’s poorest in cycles of poverty. If America’s nearest
neighbors are not secure and stable, then Americans will be less secure.

Our strategy for the Hemisphere begins with deepening key relationships with Canada
and Mexico, a foundation of shared values and cooperative policies that can be extended
throughout the region. We must continue to work with our neighbors in the Hemisphere
to reduce illegal immigration and promote expanded economic opportunity for
marginalized populations. We must also solidify strategic relationships with regional
leaders in Central and South America and the Caribbean who are deepening their
commitment to democratic values. And we must continue to work with regional partners
to make multilateral institutions like the OAS and the Inter-American Development Bank
more effective and better able to foster concerted action to address threats that may arise
to the region’s stability, security, prosperity, or democratic progress. Together, these
partnerships can advance our four strategic priorities for the region: bolstering security,
strengthening democratic institutions, promoting prosperity, and investing in people.

2. Africa

Africa holds growing geo-strategic importance and is a high priority of this
Administration. It is a place of promise and opportunity, linked to the United States by
history, culture, commerce, and strategic significance. Our goal is an African continent
that knows liberty, peace, stability, and increasing prosperity.

Africa’s potential has in the past been held hostage by the bitter legacy of colonial
misrule and bad choices by some African leaders. The United States recognizes that our
security depends upon partnering with Africans to strengthen fragile and failing states
and bring ungoverned areas under the control of effective democracies.

Overcoming the challenges Africa faces requires partnership, not paternalism. Our
strategy is to promote economic development and the expansion of effective, democratic
governance so that African states can take the lead in addressing African challenges.
Through improved governance, reduced corruption, and market reforms, African nations
can lift themselves toward a better future. We are committed to working with African

37

nations to strengthen their domestic capabilities and the regional capacity of the AU to
support post-conflict transformations, consolidate democratic transitions, and improve
peacekeeping and disaster responses.

3. Middle East

The Broader Middle East continues to command the world’s attention. For too long, too
many nations of the Middle East have suffered from a freedom deficit. Repression has
fostered corruption, imbalanced or stagnant economies, political resentments, regional
conflicts, and religious extremism. These maladies were all cloaked by an illusion of
stability. Yet the peoples of the Middle East share the same desires as people in the rest
of the world: liberty, opportunity, justice, order, and peace. These desires are now being
expressed in movements for reform. The United States is committed to supporting the
efforts of reformers to realize a better life for themselves and their region.

We seek a Middle East of independent states, at peace with each other, and fully
participating in an open global market of goods, services, and ideas. We are seeking to
build a framework that will allow Israel and the Palestinian territories to live side by side
in peace and security as two democratic states. In the wider region, we will continue to
support efforts for reform and freedom in traditional allies such as Egypt and Saudi
Arabia. Tyrannical regimes such as Iran and Syria that oppress at home and sponsor
terrorism abroad know that we will continue to stand with their people against their
misrule. And in Iraq, we will continue to support the Iraqi people and their historic
march from tyranny to effective democracy. We will work with the freely elected,
democratic government of Iraq — our new partner in the War on Terror — to consolidate
and expand freedom, and to build security and lasting stability.

4. Europe

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization remains a vital pillar of U.S. foreign policy. The
Alliance has been strengthened by expanding its membership and now acts beyond its
borders as an instrument for peace and stability in many parts of the world. It has also
established partnerships with other key European states, including Russia, Ukraine, and
others, further extending NATO's historic transformation. The internal reform of NATO
structures, capabilities, and procedures must be accelerated to ensure that NATO is able
to carry out its missions effectively. The Alliance’s door will also remain open to those
countries that aspire for membership and meet NATO standards. Further, NATO must
deepen working relationships between and across institutions, as it is doing with the EU,
and as it also could do with new institutions. Such relationships offer opportunities for
enhancing the distinctive strengths and missions of each organization.

Europe is home to some of our oldest and closest allies. Our cooperative relations are
built on a sure foundation of shared values and interests. This foundation is expanding
and deepening with the ongoing spread of effective democracies in Europe, and must
expand and deepen still further if we are to reach the goal of a Europe whole, free, and at
peace. These democracies are effective partners, joining with us to promote global

 

38 National Security Strategy

freedom and prosperity. Just as in the special relationship that binds us to the United
Kingdom, these cooperative relationships forge deeper ties between our nations.

5. Russia

The United States seeks to work closely with Russia on strategic issues of common
interest and to manage issues on which we have differing interests. By reason of
geography and power, Russia has great influence not only in Europe and its own
immediate neighborhood, but also in many other regions of vital interest to us: the
broader Middle East, South and Central Asia, and East Asia. We must encourage Russia
to respect the values of freedom and democracy at home and not to impede the cause of
freedom and democracy in these regions. Strengthening our relationship will depend on
the policies, foreign and domestic, that Russia adopts. Recent trends regrettably point
toward a diminishing commitment to democratic freedoms and institutions. We will
work to try to persuade the Russian Government to move forward, not backward, along
freedom’s path.

Stability and prosperity in Russia’s neighborhood will help deepen our relations with
Russia; but that stability will remain elusive as long as this region is not governed by
effective democracies. We will seek to persuade Russia’s government that democratic
progress in Russia and its region benefits the peoples who live there and improves
relationships with us, with other Western governments, and among themselves.
Conversely, efforts to prevent democratic development at home and abroad will hamper
the development of Russia’s relations with the United States, Europe, and its neighbors.

6. South and Central Asia

South and Central Asia is a region of great strategic importance where American interests
and values are engaged as never before. India is a great democracy, and our shared
values are the foundation of our good relations. We are eager to see Pakistan move along
a stable, secure, and democratic path. Our goal is for the entire region of South and
Central Asia to be democratic, prosperous, and at peace.

We have made great strides in transforming America’s relationship with India, a major
power that shares our commitment to freedom, democracy, and rule of law. In July 2005,
we signed a bold agreement — a roadmap to realize the meaningful cooperation that had
eluded our two nations for decades. India now is poised to shoulder global obligations in
cooperation with the United States in a way befitting a major power.

Progress with India has been achieved even as the United States has improved its
strategic relationship with Pakistan. For decades, outsiders acted as if good relations with
India and Pakistan were mutually exclusive. This Administration has shown that
improved relations with each are possible and can help India and Pakistan make strides
toward a lasting peace between themselves. America’s relationship with Pakistan will
not be a mirror image of our relationship with India. Together, our relations with the
nations of South Asia can serve as a foundation for deeper engagement throughout

 

National Security Strategy 39

Central Asia. Increasingly, Afghanistan will assume its historical role as a land-bridge
between South and Central Asia, connecting these two vital regions.

Central Asia is an enduring priority for our foreign policy. The five countries of Central
Asia are distinct from one another and our relations with each, while important, will
differ. In the region as a whole, the elements of our larger strategy meet, and we must
pursue those elements simultaneously: promoting effective democracies and the
expansion of free-market reforms, diversifying global sources of energy, and enhancing
security and winning the War on Terror.

7. East Asia

East Asia is a region of great opportunities and lingering tensions. Over the past decade,
it has been a source of extraordinary economic dynamism and also of economic
turbulence. Few regional economies have more effectively harnessed the engines of
future prosperity: technology and globalized trade. Yet few regions have had greater
difficulty overcoming the suspicions of the past.

The United States is a Pacific nation, with extensive interests throughout East and
Southeast Asia. The region’s stability and prosperity depend on our sustained
engagement: maintaining robust partnerships supported by a forward defense posture
supporting economic integration through expanded trade and investment and promoting
democracy and human rights.

Forging new international initiatives and institutions can assist in the spread of freedom,
prosperity, and regional security. Existing institutions like the APEC forum and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum, can play a vital role.
New arrangements, such as the U.S.-ASEAN Enhanced Partnership, or others that are
focused on problem-solving and action, like the Six-Party Talks and the PSI, can likewise
bring together Asian nations to address common challenges. And Asian nations that
share our values can join us in partnership to strengthen new democracies and promote
democratic reforms throughout the region. This institutional framework, however, must
be built upon a foundation of sound bilateral relations with key states in the region.

With Japan, the United States enjoys the closest relations in a generation. As the world’s
two largest economies and aid donors, acting in concert multiplies each of our strengths
and magnifies our combined contributions to global progress. Our shared commitment to
democracy at home offers a sure foundation for cooperation abroad.

With Australia, our alliance is global in scope. From Iraq and Afghanistan to our historic
FTA, we are working jointly to ensure security, prosperity, and expanded liberty.

With the ROK, we share a vision of a prosperous, democratic, and united Korean
peninsula. We also share a commitment to democracy at home and progress abroad and
are translating that common vision into joint action to sustain our alliance into the

21* century.

 

40 National Security Strategy

With Southeast Asia, we celebrate the dynamism of increased economic freedom and
look to further extend political freedom to all the people in the region, including those
suffering under the repressive regime in Burma. In promoting greater economic and
political liberty, we will work closely with our allies and key friends, including
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.

China encapsulates Asia’s dramatic economic successes, but China’s transition remains
incomplete. In one generation, China has gone from poverty and isolation to growing
integration into the international economic system. China once opposed global
institutions; today it is a permanent member of the UNSC and the WTO. As China
becomes a global player, it must act as a responsible stakeholder that fulfills its
obligations and works with the United States and others to advance the international
system that has enabled its success: enforcing the international rules that have helped
China lift itself out of a century of economic deprivation, embracing the economic and
political standards that go along with that system of rules, and contributing to
international stability and security by working with the United States and other major
powers.

China’s leaders proclaim that they have made a decision to walk the transformative path
of peaceful development. If China keeps this commitment, the United States will
welcome the emergence of a China that is peaceful and prosperous and that cooperates
with us to address common challenges and mutual interests. China can make an
important contribution to global prosperity and ensure its own prosperity for the longer
term if it will rely more on domestic demand and less on global trade imbalances to drive
its economic growth. China shares our exposure to the challenges of globalization and
other transnational concerns. Mutual interests can guide our cooperation on issues such
as terrorism, proliferation, and energy security. We will work to increase our cooperation
to combat disease pandemics and reverse environmental degradation.

The United States encourages China to continue down the road of reform and openness,
because in this way China’s leaders can meet the legitimate needs and aspirations of the
Chinese people for liberty, stability, and prosperity. As economic growth continues,
China will face a growing demand from its own people to follow the path of East Asia’s
many modern democracies, adding political freedom to economic freedom. Continuing
along this path will contribute to regional and international security.

China’s leaders must realize, however, that they cannot stay on this peaceful path while
holding on to old ways of thinking and acting that exacerbate concerns throughout the
region and the world. These old ways include:

e Continuing China’s military expansion in a non-transparent way;
e Expanding trade, but acting as if they can somehow “lock up” energy supplies around

the world or seek to direct markets rather than opening them up — as if they can
follow a mercantilism borrowed from a discredited era; and

 

National Security Strategy 41

e Supporting resource-rich countries without regard to the misrule at home or
misbehavior abroad of those regimes.

China and Taiwan must also resolve their differences peacefully, without coercion and
without unilateral action by either China or Taiwan.

Ultimately, China’s leaders must see that they cannot let their population increasingly
experience the freedoms to buy, sell, and produce, while denying them the rights to
assemble, speak, and worship. Only by allowing the Chinese people to enjoy these basic
freedoms and universal rights can China honor its own constitution and international
commitments and reach its full potential. Our strategy seeks to encourage China to make
the right strategic choices for its people, while we hedge against other possibilities.

Transform America’s National Security Institutions to Meet the Challenges and
Opportunities of the 21“ Century

A. Summary of National Security Strategy 2002

The major institutions of American national security were designed in a different era to
meet different challenges. They must be transformed.

B. Current Context: Successes and Challenges

In the last four years, we have made substantial progress in transforming key national
security institutions.

e The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security brought under one
authority 22 federal entities with vital roles to play in protecting our Nation and
preventing terrorist attacks within the United States. The Department is focused on
three national security priorities: preventing terrorist attacks within the United States;
reducing America’s vulnerability to terrorism; and minimizing the damage and
facilitating the recovery from attacks that do occur.

e In 2004, the Intelligence Community launched its most significant reorganization
since the 1947 National Security Act. The centerpiece is a new position, the Director
of National Intelligence, endowed with expanded budgetary, acquisition, tasking, and
personnel authorities to integrate more effectively the efforts of the Community into a
more unified, coordinated, and effective whole. The transformation also includes a
new National Counterterrorism Center and a new National Counterproliferation
Center to manage and coordinate planning and activities in those critical areas. The
transformation extends to the FBI, which has augmented its intelligence capabilities
and is now more fully and effectively integrated with the Intelligence Community.

e The Department of Defense has completed the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review,
which details how the Department will continue to adapt and build to meet new
challenges.

e Weare pursuing a future force that will provide tailored deterrence of both state
and non-state threats (including WMD employment, terrorist attacks in the
physical and information domains, and opportunistic aggression) while assuring
allies and dissuading potential competitors. The Department of Defense also is
expanding Special Operations Forces and investing in advanced conventional
capabilities to help win the long war against terrorist extremists and to help
dissuade any hostile military competitor from challenging the United States, its
allies, and partners.

e The Department is transforming itself to better balance its capabilities across four
categories of challenges:

 

National Security Strategy 43

e Traditional challenges posed by states employing conventional armies, navies,
and air forces in well-established forms of military competition.

e Irregular challenges from state and non-state actors employing methods such as
terrorism and insurgency to counter our traditional military advantages, or
engaging in criminal activity such as piracy and drug trafficking that threaten
regional security.

e Catastrophic challenges involving the acquisition, possession, and use of WMD
by state and non-state actors; and deadly pandemics and other natural disasters
that produce WMD-like effects.

e Disruptive challenges from state and non-state actors who employ technologies
and capabilities (such as biotechnology, cyber and space operations, or directed-
energy weapons) in new ways to counter military advantages the United States
currently enjoys.

C. The Way Ahead

We must extend and enhance the transformation of key institutions, both domestically
and abroad.

At home, we will pursue three priorities:

e Sustaining the transformation already under way in the Departments of
Defense, Homeland Security, and Justice; the Federal Bureau of Investigation;
and the Intelligence Community.

e Continuing to reorient the Department of State towards transformational
diplomacy, which promotes effective democracy and responsible sovereignty.
Our diplomats must be able to step outside their traditional role to become more
involved with the challenges within other societies, helping them directly,
channeling assistance, and learning from their experience. This effort will
include:

e Promoting the efforts of the new Director for Foreign
Assistance/Administrator to ensure that foreign assistance is used as
effectively as possible to meet our broad foreign policy objectives. This new
office will align more fully the foreign assistance activities carried out by the
Department of State and USAID, demonstrating that we are responsible
stewards of taxpayer dollars.

e Improving our capability to plan for and respond to post-conflict and failed-
state situations. The Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization will integrate
all relevant United States Government resources and assets in conducting
reconstruction and stabilization operations. This effort must focus on building

 

44 National Security Strategy

the security and law enforcement structures that are often the prerequisite for
restoring order and ensuring success.

e Developing a civilian reserve corps, analogous to the military reserves. The
civilian reserve corps would utilize, in a flexible and timely manner, the
human resources of the American people for skills and capacities needed for
international disaster relief and post-conflict reconstruction.

e Strengthening our public diplomacy, so that we advocate the policies and
values of the United States in a clear, accurate, and persuasive way to a
watching and listening world. This includes actively engaging foreign
audiences, expanding educational opportunities for Americans to learn about
foreign languages and cultures and for foreign students and scholars to study
in the United States; empowering the voices of our citizen ambassadors as
well as those foreigners who share our commitment to a safer, more
compassionate world; enlisting the support of the private sector; increasing
our channels for dialogue with Muslim leaders and citizens; and confronting
propaganda quickly, before myths and distortions have time to take root in the
hearts and minds of people across the world.

e Improving the capacity of agencies to plan, prepare, coordinate, integrate,
and execute responses covering the full range of crisis contingencies and
long-term challenges.

e We need to strengthen the capacity of departments and agencies to do
comprehensive, results-oriented planning.

e Agencies that traditionally played only a domestic role increasingly have a
role to play in our foreign and security policies. This requires us to better
integrate interagency activity both at home and abroad.

Abroad, we will work with our allies on three priorities:
e Promoting meaningful reform of the U.N., including:

e Creating structures to ensure financial accountability and administrative
and organizational efficiency.

e  Enshrining the principle that membership and participation privileges are
earned by responsible behavior and by reasonable burden-sharing of
security and stability challenges.

e Enhancing the capacity of the U.N. and associated regional organizations
to stand up well-trained, rapidly deployable, sustainable military and
gendarme units for peace operations.

 

National Security Strategy 45

46

e Ensuring that the U.N. reflects today’s geopolitical realities and is not shackled by
obsolete structures.

e Reinvigorating the U.N.’s commitment, reflected in the U.N. Charter, to the
promotion of democracy and human rights.

Enhancing the role of democracies and democracy promotion throughout
international and multilateral institutions, including:

e Strengthening and institutionalizing the Community of Democracies.

e Fostering the creation of regional democracy-based institutions in Asia, the
Middle East, Africa, and elsewhere.

e Improving the capacity of the U.N. and other multilateral institutions to advance
the freedom agenda through tools like the U.N. Democracy Fund.

e Coordinating more effectively the unique contributions of international financial
institutions and regional development banks.

Establishing results-oriented partnerships on the model of the PSI to meet new
challenges and opportunities. These partnerships emphasize international
cooperation, not international bureaucracy. They rely on voluntary adherence rather
than binding treaties. They are oriented towards action and results rather than
legislation or rule-making.

Engage the Opportunities and Confront the Challenges of Globalization

In recent years, the world has witnessed the growing importance of a set of opportunities
and challenges that were addressed indirectly in National Security Strategy 2002: the
national security implications of globalization.

Globalization presents many opportunities. Much of the world’s prosperity and improved
living standards in recent years derive from the expansion of global trade, investment,
information, and technology. The United States has been a leader in promoting these
developments, and we believe they have improved significantly the quality of life of the
American people and people the world over. Other nations have embraced these
opportunities and have likewise benefited. Globalization has also helped the advance of
democracy by extending the marketplace of ideas and the ideals of liberty.

These new flows of trade, investment, information, and technology are transforming
national security. Globalization has exposed us to new challenges and changed the way
old challenges touch our interests and values, while also greatly enhancing our capacity
to respond. Examples include:

e Public health challenges like pandemics (HIV/AIDS, avian influenza) that
recognize no borders. The risks to social order are so great that traditional public
health approaches may be inadequate, necessitating new strategies and responses.

e = Illicit trade, whether in drugs, human beings, or sex, that exploits the modern era’s
greater ease of transport and exchange. Such traffic corrodes social order; bolsters
crime and corruption; undermines effective governance; facilitates the illicit transfer
of WMD and advanced conventional weapons technology; and compromises
traditional security and law enforcement.

e Environmental destruction, whether caused by human behavior or cataclysmic
mega-disasters such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, or tsunamis. Problems of
this scope may overwhelm the capacity of local authorities to respond, and may even
overtax national militaries, requiring a larger international response.

These challenges are not traditional national security concerns, such as the conflict of
arms or ideologies. But if left unaddressed they can threaten national security. We have
learned that:

e Preparing for and managing these challenges requires the full exercise of national
power, up to and including traditional security instruments. For example, the U.S.
military provided critical logistical support in the response to the Southeast Asian
tsunami and the South Asian earthquake until U.N. and civilian humanitarian
responders could relieve the military of these vital duties.

e Technology can help, but the key to rapid and effective response lies in achieving
unity of effort across a range of agencies. For example, our response to the Katrina

47

and Rita hurricanes underscored the need for communications systems that remain
operational and integrated during times of crisis. Even more vital, however, is
improved coordination within the Federal government, with state and local partners,
and with the private sector.

e Existing international institutions have a role to play, but in many cases coalitions of
the willing may be able to respond more quickly and creatively, at least in the short
term. For example, U.S. leadership in mobilizing the Regional Core Group to
respond to the tsunami of 2004 galvanized the follow-on international response.

e The response and the new partnerships it creates can sometimes serve as a catalyst for
changing existing political conditions to address other problems. For example, the
response to the tsunami in Southeast Asia and the earthquake in Pakistan developed
new lines of communication and cooperation at a local level, which opened the door
to progress in reconciling long-standing regional conflicts in Aceh and the Kashmir.

Effective democracies are better able to deal with these challenges than are repressive or
poorly governed states. Pandemics require robust and fully transparent public health
systems, which weak governments and those that fear freedom are unable or unwilling to
provide. Yet these challenges require effective democracies to come together in
innovative ways.

The United States must lead the effort to reform existing institutions and create new ones
— including forging new partnerships between governmental and nongovernmental actors,
and with transnational and international organizations.

To confront illicit trade, for example, the Administration launched the Proliferation
Security Initiative and the APEC Secure Trade in the APEC Region Initiative, both of
which focus on tangible steps governments can take to combat illegal trade.

To combat the cultivation and trafficking of narcotics, the Administration devotes over
$1 billion annually to comprehensive counternarcotics efforts, working with
governments, particularly in Latin America and Asia, to eradicate crops, destroy
production facilities, interdict shipments, and support developing alternative livelihoods.

To confront the threat of a possible pandemic, the Administration took the lead in
creating the International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza, a new global
partnership of states committed to effective surveillance and preparedness that will help
to detect and respond quickly to any outbreaks of the disease.

Conclusion

The challenges America faces are great, yet we have enormous power and
influence to address those challenges. The times require an ambitious national
security strategy, yet one recognizing the limits to what even a nation as powerful
as the United States can achieve by itself. Our national security strategy is
idealistic about goals, and realistic about means.

There was a time when two oceans seemed to provide protection from problems
in other lands, leaving America to lead by example alone. That time has long
since passed. America cannot know peace, security, and prosperity by retreating
from the world. America must lead by deed as well as by example. This is how
we plan to lead, and this is the legacy we will leave to those who follow.
